title: Setting-independent climate regulator control
abstract: Climate regulation within an enclosure (e.g., a server cabinet) may involve a climate regulator device that reports a set of available settings (e.g., fan speeds of a fan array) to a computational unit that selects among the available settings. However, such techniques involve bidirectional communication between the climate regulator device and a computational unit that is capable of utilizing the device-specific settings. Presented herein are climate regulation architectures involving a request from the computational unit as a climate target that is independent of the settings of the climate regulator devices (e.g., an selection on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 100). A climate regulator controller may map the device-independent climate target to a selection among the available settings of the particular climate regulator device(s). Further variations may involve conflict resolution among requests from different computational sub-units, and/or failsafe mechanisms such as default climate regulator device settings to alleviate controller failure.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve an enclosure of a computational unit such as a cabinet for a computer comprising a set of electronic components e.g. processors memory components and nonvolatile storage devices where climate regulation within the enclosure is achieved through the use of one or more climate regulators. Because excess heat may disrupt the accurate operation of the computational unit and eventually cause thermal damage the enclosure may comprise thermal climate regulators such as a set of fans positioned and configured to draw air into the enclosure push the air over the components of the computational unit and expel heated air out of the enclosure as exhaust. More powerful temperature regulation may be achieved through the use of heating components and or air conditioning components that actively heat or cool the inlet air or the residual air within the enclosure. Other types of climate regulators may manage other climate properties of the enclosure e.g. humidity regulators may add or remove moisture from the inlet air air pressure regulators may adjust the air pressure within the enclosure and air filter regulators may remove particulate contaminants of inlet air . These active climate regulators may interoperate with passive climate regulators e.g. heatsinks that physically contact the electronic components and diffuse heat over a large area surface to regulate the climate within the enclosure.

Many types of climate regulators provided within an enclosure may present configurable operating settings. For example fans may be set to operate at faster or slower fan speeds to achieve variable cooling and a fan array may adjust the number of operating fans. While more powerful climate regulation may be desirable to maintain the climate within the enclosure within a precise range higher operating rates of climate regulators may involve greater energy expenditure e.g. higher electricity costs and faster drain of batteries of portable devices and or increased noise or vibration within the enclosure. Accordingly the operating settings of climate regulators may be adjusted by a user and or automatically by the enclosure.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In many enclosures a computational unit utilizes a climate regulator device by choosing among the available climate regulator settings. For example a fan array may specify a set of fan settings to the computational unit and the computational unit may select a desired setting and operate the fan at the selected setting. In more sophisticated scenarios the fan array may specify the capabilities associated with each setting e.g. the rate of cooling or target temperature achievable by a particular setting in order to enable the computational unit to provide a more accurate selection.

However scenarios wherein the computational unit performs a device specific selection may present various disadvantages. As a first example a climate regulator device may specify its settings in a manner that the computational unit is unable to utilize e.g. the computational unit may operate on degrees Celsius and a fan array may specify climate regulation in degrees Fahrenheit . Moreover a new climate regulating technology may provide a different type of setting that the computational unit does not understand or support e.g. a water cooled thermal flushing system may report its cooling settings as a flow rate achievable by the pump . As a second example such architectures involve a bidirectional communication architecture between the climate regulator device and the computational unit e.g. the climate regulator device reporting its settings to the computational unit and the computational unit informing the climate regulator device of its selection wherein the complexity of the climate regulation infrastructure may be reduced without diminished functionality. As a third example such architecture may provide limited management support such as reconciling conflicting requests from two or more computational sub units applying a request to two or more climate regulator devices or recovering from failures in the climate regulation infrastructure.

Presented herein are climate regulating infrastructures and components that provide comparatively efficient and flexible regulation. In accordance with these techniques the computational unit may specify a climate target that is independent of the climate regulator settings of the climate regulator device such as an arbitrary climate regulation gradient specified on a scale of 0 to 100 wherein 0 indicates minimum climate regulation e.g. no climate regulation and 100 indicates maximum climate regulation. A climate regulator controller may receive the climate target from the computational unit and may map the climate target into a selection of a setting among the settings supported by the particular climate regulator device s provided in the enclosure. Such architectures dissociate the requests issued by the computational unit from the particular settings and capabilities of the climate regulator device thus avoiding the communication of the capabilities to the computational unit and the specification of the climate target as a setting of the climate regulator device. Such architectures may also enable the translation of device independent requests to device specific requests for devices without particular support by the computational units including new or unusual climate regulator components. Moreover the specification of climate regulation in a device independent manner may facilitate the resolution of conflicts such as choosing a climate regulator device setting based on multiple conflicting requests received from different computational sub units and choosing among several combinations of settings for a set of climate regulator devices that may each be compatible with the request. These and other advantages may be achievable through the application of the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve an enclosure storing one or more devices such as an enclosure storing a computer comprising a mainboard one or more processors volatile and nonvolatile storage and communications components such as network adapters or a server cabinet storing components comprising one or more servers. In these scenarios the air within the enclosure may vary in particular climate properties such as the temperature humidity air pressure and the reduction of particulate matter e.g. dust and smoke of the air within the enclosure. The devices within the enclosure may be sensitive to such properties of the climate e.g. electronic components may function reliably only within a range of operating temperatures and excess humidity may disrupt electrical propagation of circuits. Additionally the operation of the devices may alter such properties e.g. by generating heat or creating particulate contaminants through friction between moving components and may exacerbate undesirable climate conditions within the enclosure. The consistent and reliable operation of the devices within the enclosure may therefore depend on regulating various properties of the climate within the enclosure.

In view of these considerations the enclosure may include one or more climate regulating components that are configured to regulate various properties of the climate within the enclosure. Such regulation may be achieved through passive climate regulator devices that present physical and or chemical properties that provide regulatory capabilities such as heatsinks comprising conductive metals in physical contact with a device that diffuse excess heat over a wide surface area to facilitate cooling and screens that trap particulate matter to reduce contamination within the enclosure. Further climate regulation may be provided by active climate regulator devices that utilize electric power. For example the temperature of the air within the enclosure may be regulated by fans air conditioners and heaters humidity regulation may be regulated by humidifiers and dehumidifiers air pressure may be regulated by compressors and particulate matter may be regulated by electrostatic air filters.

 Active climate regulators may often present various operating levels such as fan speeds of fans cooling magnitude provided by air conditioners heat generated by heating units and the strength of an electrostatic field configured to trap particles. Such operating levels may be controlled e.g. by a physical switch positioned on the device that a user may manually toggle or by software instructions generated by a user or device. While utilizing higher operating levels of climate regulators may provide greater climate regulation e.g. more rapid and or precise regulation of temperature and more powerful electrostatic removal of particulate matter higher operating levels may entail undesirable side effects e.g. higher fan speeds may generate fan noise stronger electrostatic fields may create interference with wired or wireless electric or magnetic signals and higher operating levels may consume more power thus increasing operating costs and draining batteries in mobile devices . In view of these considerations it may be desirable to balance higher climate regulation with undesirable side effects by adapting the operating levels of climate regulator devices in response to conditions within the enclosure e.g. by configuring control modules to increase the operating levels of climate regulators when circumstances within the enclosure indicate additional climate regulation and to reduce the operating levels of climate regulators when climate regulation may be acceptably conserved.

In this exemplary scenario the operation of the fan array is specified by the computational unit through the available climate regulator settings . For example the fan array may report the available climate regulator settings to the computational unit . If the enclosure registers a high air temperature that may jeopardize the proper functioning of the processors the computational unit may select the climate regulator setting for utilizing all four fans and may send a request such as a specially encoded electronic signal to the fan array in order to choose the four fans selected climate regulator setting . The fan array may therefore deliver power to all of the fans creating a large amount of airflow resulting in rapid cooling of the air temperature within the enclosure . Alternatively if the enclosure registers an acceptable air temperature within the enclosure the computational unit may send a request to the fan array to select the two fans climate regulator setting . The fan array may fulfill this request by delivering power only to one fan thereby providing reduced airflow and reduced cooling within the enclosure . In this manner the enclosure may control the operation of the fan array to provide variable levels of cooling in response to conditions within the enclosure .

The techniques presented in the exemplary scenarios of may achieve variable climate regulation within the enclosure based on the particular capabilities of the fan array . However in this exemplary scenario the fan array and computational unit communicate according to the particular climate regulator settings supported by the fan array e.g. the fan array is configured to report the available climate regulator settings to the computational unit and the computational unit sends a request selecting one of the available climate regulator settings .

This architecture may impose some limitations on the architecture of the climate regulation infrastructure. As a first example the computational unit may only select the types of climate regulator settings that it understands. For example the computational unit may be compatible with the climate regulator settings of the first fan array specified as four fans and two fans or may even report its selectable climate regulator settings as high specifying four fans and low specifying two fans and the computational unit may be capable of choosing among these climate regulator settings . However a more sophisticated fan array may specify its climate regulator settings both in terms of the number of fans and the speed of the fans and may enable the computational unit to alter both the power and the topography of the airflow e.g. applying higher cooling targeting the processors or applying cooling broadly to all of the components within the entire computational unit but the computational unit may not be configured to select among such properties. Similar problems may arise in view of standards e.g. a climate regulator setting may specify its settings in degrees Fahrenheit while the computational unit interprets them as degrees Celsius . As a second example this architecture may simply be incompatible with different types of climate regulation that report different types of climate regulator settings . For example a liquid cooling climate regulator system may specify its climate regulator settings in terms of liquid flow rates and the computational unit may be incapable of utilizing this information to choose a correct climate regulator setting . As a third example the architecture may be confined to a particular type of climate regulation e.g. the climate regulation infrastructure that is configured based on airflow and temperature may be incompatible with a climate regulator device providing humidity control or filtration of particulate matter. As a fourth example if the climate regulator settings for a particular climate regulator device change e.g. the addition of new climate regulator settings after the addition of more fans or the removal of a climate regulator setting involving a fan that has failed the computational unit may be incapable of adjusting to the new climate regulator settings . As a fifth example it may be difficult to reconcile different requests communicated by different computational units e.g. a first computational unit in the enclosure requesting a two fan climate regulator setting and a second computational unit in the same enclosure requesting a four fan climate regulator setting . As a sixth example a computational unit may have difficulty operating two or more climate regulator devices particularly if such devices offer different sets of climate regulator settings e.g. a first fan array providing two fan and four fan settings and a second fan array providing high and low settings .

It may be appreciated that these and other problems may be related to the communication between the computational unit and the climate regulator devices based on the available climate regulator settings . That is the computational unit has to be aware of the climate regulator settings supported by the climate regulator device s has to be capable of choosing among such climate regulator settings based on some criteria and has to communicate the request to the fan according to the climate regulator settings e.g. a specially encoded electronic signal identifying the two fan climate regulator setting . Additionally the climate regulator device may have to be configured to communicate the climate regulator settings to the computational unit according to a particular communication standard and to receive an electrical signal from the computational unit encoding a request specifying a particular climate regulator setting . These constraints associated with the architecture designed around communicating based on the particular climate regulator settings of the climate regulator device may therefore increase the complexity and reduce the flexibility of the climate regulation architecture.

Presented herein are alternative climate regulator architectures that decouple the requests of the computational unit from the climate regulator settings of the climate regulator devices. In such scenarios the computational units may operate without any information about the climate regulator settings of the climate regulator device or even the number type and capabilities of climate regulator devices within the enclosure . Rather the computational unit may specify a climate target that requests climate regulation through a device independent set of options e.g. an arbitrary climate regulation gradient represented as a scale from 0 indicating a minimum climate regulation e.g. no climate regulation to 100 indicating a maximum climate regulation. A climate regulator controller may receive the device independent climate target map it to the particular climate regulator settings of the particular climate regulator device s and operate the climate regulator devices at the selected climate regulator settings .

The climate regulation architecture illustrated in the exemplary scenario of may provide several advantages over device specific architectures. As a first example the climate regulator device does not have to report the climate regulator settings to the computational unit and the computational unit does not have to issue a request specially encoding a particular climate regulator setting of the climate regulator device . Rather any computational unit may specify the climate target e.g. as an abstract value that may be applied by any climate regulator device . As a second example an arbitrary climate target such as a 0 to 100 selection may be applicable to a wide range of climate regulator devices including those presenting new and or unusual types or capabilities. As a third example the climate regulator controller may utilize a variety of logic for this mapping optionally involving other properties e.g. also involving a detected climate property within the enclosure and or the currently selected climate regulator setting of the climate regulator device . The mapping may also be performed according to a policy e.g. applying the 0 to 100 request based on a maximum cooling policy or an energy saving policy . Additionally it may be easier to reconcile conflicts between requests received from different computational units e.g. a climate target of 40 from a first server and of 80 from a second server and or to apply the requests to a varied set of climate regulator devices . These and other advantages may be achievable through the device independent climate regulator architecture provided herein.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nonvolatile computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques presented herein may be implemented with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other architectures and implementations. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be used to regulate climate within many types of enclosures storing many types of computational units . For example the enclosures may comprise a chassis and case of a workstation the exterior of a notebook or palmtop computer a cabinet of a server or a rack storing a set of servers or workstation computers operating with various degrees of independence e.g. a set of exposed mainboards with processing units comprising the blades of a multi blade server or a set of fully autonomous workstations that may communicate in a server client or peer to peer manner or may be fully isolated from one another .

As a second variation of this first aspect climate regulation may be provided on behalf of many types of computational units stored within the enclosure such as microprocessors volatile memory circuits nonvolatile storage devices such as hard disk drives and solid state storage devices input output devices such as display adapters sound renderers video and audio devices and media encoding and decoding circuits communications components such as network adapters switches hubs routers modems transceivers and repeaters and infrastructure components such as mainboards and buses.

As a third variation of this first aspect many types of climate regulator devices may be included that feature many types of climate regulating properties. A a first example the climate regulator devices may control temperature within the enclosure such as fans creating airflow heaters creating heat within the enclosure air conditioners that actively extract heat from the air within the enclosure and liquid cooling systems that exchange air and liquid temperature and then cool the liquid outside of the enclosure . As a second example the climate regulator devices may alter the conditions of the air within the enclosure such as by removing ionized particles that may create undesired electrostatic charge within the enclosure . As a third example the climate regulator devices may regulate humidity such as humidifiers and or dehumidifiers. As a fourth example the climate regulator devices may regulate barometric pressure such as air pumps that add or remove air from within an airtight enclosure . As a fifth example the climate regulator devices may alter air composition such as by injecting oxygen removing unwanted gases or filtering out particulate solids. These and other climate regulation devices may be controlled through an embodiment of the techniques presented herein.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of configuring the climate regulator controller to map a climate target that is specified independent of the type properties or climate regulator settings of any particular climate regulator device to a selected climate regulator setting of a particular climate regulator device .

As a first variation of this second aspect the climate target may be specified as any member of a climate target set such as any integer value within an arbitrarily gradient from 0 to 100 where 0 specifies a minimum climate regulation e.g. no climate regulation and 100 specifies a maximum climate regulation. The values in between may represent e.g. a linear logarithmic or exponential scale between these extremes. Alternatively the climate targets may represent a more discrete or finite set of values such as above average average below average and off. Additionally the climate targets may have various though still device independent semantics. For example As a climate target of 0 may indicate a request either to halt climate regulation e.g. a request to stop cooling the enclosure if the air temperature is already too cool or may indicate that the computational unit is performing acceptably and that any climate regulator setting that maintains the current conditions may be acceptable.

As a second variation of this second aspect the climate regulator controller identifies more than one climate regulator setting that may map to the climate target . As a first such example a climate target of 0 indicating that the current conditions are acceptable may be compatible with either halting climate regulation or with maintaining a low level of climate regulation e.g. operating a fan at the lowest climate regulator setting . As a second such example the number of climate regulator settings supported by a climate regulator device may exceed the number of climate targets selectable within the climate target set. In such scenarios the climate regulator controller may apply some additional logic to choose among two or more climate regulator settings that are compatible with the climate target . For example where at least two of the climate regulator settings comprising a compatible climate regulator setting for the climate target the climate regulator controller may identify the compatible climate regulator settings for the climate target and map the climate target to a selected compatible climate regulator setting.

As a third variation of this second aspect the climate regulator controller may adjust the mapping and or re map the climate target to a new selected climate regulator setting if the set of climate regulator devices changes. As a first such example a new climate regulator device may be newly added to and or removed from the enclosure . As a second such example a current climate regulator device may be selectively placed online and or taken offline e.g. certain high powered climate regulator devices such as air conditioners may only be usable and included in the set of climate regulator devices if the temperature exceeds a critical threshold or only during a certain time of day such as the hottest period of a day . As a third such example a climate regulator device may be detected to have failed or to be operating inefficiently or unacceptably e.g. generating an unacceptable amount of noise . In such scenarios the climate regulator controller may re map the climate target to one or more different selected climate regulator settings and the operation of the climate regulator devices may be accordingly adjusted.

As a fourth variation of this second aspect the climate regulator controller may apply various considerations while mapping the climate target to the selected climate regulator setting . As one such example the climate regulator may further comprise at least two climate target mapping policies each indicating a different logic for mapping the climate targets to the climate regulator settings e.g. a maximum cooling policy that aggressively cools the enclosure and an energy saving policy that conservatively cools the enclosure . The climate regulator controller may identify a selected climate target mapping policy among the climate target mapping policies and may map the climate target to a selected climate regulator setting of the climate regulator device according to the selected climate target mapping policy. The climate target policies may be provided or specified e.g. by the climate regulator device by a computational unit and or by a user of the device and or may be automatically evolved or attuned to the conditions of the enclosure . Additionally the selection of a particular climate target policy among the available policies may be specified by the computational unit and or by the user or may be automatically selected by the climate regulator controller or another regulatory component of the enclosure e.g. an energy monitoring component of the enclosure may select a maximum cooling climate target mapping policy when available energy is plentiful and an energy saving climate target mapping policy when available energy is limited .

As a third variation of this second aspect in some scenarios the enclosure may comprise two or more computational sub units e.g. a server cabinet storing two or more servers each of which may specify a climate target . Moreover the climate targets may differ e.g. a first computational sub unit specifying a first climate target of 20 and a second computational sub unit concurrently specifying a second climate target of 80 that is different from the first climate target creating a conflict to be resolved by the climate regulator controller . The climate regulator controller may therefore select a consensus climate target on behalf of the computational sub units for mapping to the selected climate regulator setting such as selecting a maximum climate target of the first climate target and the second climate target or selecting a median average climate target e.g. 50 of the first climate target and the second climate target . Additionally the conflict resolution may be specified by a climate target mapping policy e.g. a high cooling policy may indicate choosing the maximum climate target and an energy saving policy may indicate choosing the median . As another example the conflict resolution may involve identifying the significance of the requests e.g. a first climate target specified by a higher priority component and a second climate target specified by a lower priority component and may choose the consensus climate target accordingly.

As a fourth variation of this second aspect the climate regulator controller may receive the climate targets from the computational units in various ways. As a first example the climate regulator controller may provide a memory buffer e.g. an SRAM DRAM or NVRAM memory region where the computational units may write a selected climate target and may update the selected climate target upon request. This example may present an advantage e.g. of persisting a recent request from the computational unit even if the computational unit fails and is no longer able to specify the climate target . As a second example the climate regulator controller may query the computational unit for a climate target e.g. once periodically at a query frequency or upon detecting a particular event such as a change in climate conditions within the enclosure . This example may enable a more rapid detection by the climate regulator controller of a failure of the computational unit e.g. a computational unit may be on the verge of failing due to high temperature and the climate regulator controller may automatically select a maximum climate target in order to cool the computational unit rapidly and potentially avoid a more significant failure.

As a fifth variation of this second aspect the climate regulator controller may be utilized to control a set of two or more climate regulator device e.g. a set of two or more fan arrays within the enclosure . In some such scenarios each climate regulator device may be operable through a different climate regulator setting and optionally may provide different climate regulator setting sets or even different types of climate regulation e.g. a fan array providing basic cooling and an air conditioner that provides more aggressive cooling . Moreover a particular climate target may be compatible with two or more sets of climate regulator settings provided to the climate regulator device . For example two identical fan arrays may each provide a two fan setting and a four fan setting and a climate target may be mapped to the activation of six fans which may be achievable either by choosing the two fan setting of the first fan array and the four fan setting of the second fan array or vice versa. These and other techniques may be utilized for configuring the climate regulator controller to map at least one climate target to a climate regulator setting of at least one climate regulator device in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques involves adjusting the mapping of a climate target to a selected climate regulator setting in view of various other factors and or events.

As a first example of this third aspect a climate regulator controller may use other sources of information to adjust the mapping of a climate target to the selection of climate regulator setting . As a first example the climate regulator may further comprise a climate detector that is configured to detect a climate property of a climate of the computational unit e.g. the current temperature of a processor and or a property of the climate within the enclosure e.g. the air temperature and the climate regulator controller may map the climate target and the climate property to the selected climate regulator setting of the climate regulator device . As a second example the climate regulator controller may map the climate target to a selected climate regulator setting of the climate regulator device in view of the currently selected climate regulator setting of the climate regulator device . For example if the computational unit selects a comparatively high climate target of 80 but the climate regulator device is currently unpowered the climate regulator controller may first select a low climate regulator setting and may later select a higher climate regulator setting if the computational unit continues selecting a comparatively high climate target of 80. 

As a second variation of this third aspect the climate regulator may be adapted to detect and compensate for a failure of the climate regulator controller as a failsafe mechanism. For example the climate regulator device may include a default climate regulator setting to be used if selections from the climate regulator controller are not provided. Upon detecting a failure of the climate regulator controller e.g. failing to receive a response from the climate regulator controller while periodically requesting responses such as a heartbeat detection model the climate regulator device may automatically select the default climate regulator setting. In this manner the climate regulator may provide climate regulation notwithstanding the failure of the climate regulator controller . These and other adjustments of the climate target may be utilized by embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

In some embodiments device may include additional features and or functionality. For example device may include one or more additional storage components including but not limited to a hard disk drive a solid state storage device and or other removable or non removable magnetic or optical media. In one embodiment computer readable and processor executable instructions implementing one or more embodiments provided herein are stored in the storage component .

Such communication components may comprise a wired connection connecting to a network through a physical cord cable or wire or a wireless connection communicating wirelessly with a networking device such as through visible light infrared or one or more radiofrequencies.

The computing device may include one or more input components such as keyboard mouse pen voice input device touch input device infrared cameras or video input devices and or one or more output components such as one or more displays speakers and printers. The input components and or output components may be connected to the computing device via a wired connection a wireless connection or any combination thereof.
