The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays. More particularly the present invention provides an acoustic ranging system that measures the magnitude of the separation of a pair of towed acoustic line arrays at a discrete point of the array in such a manner as to eliminate a multitude of measuring errors.

Towed underwater acoustic sonar arrays are employed onboard surface ships submarines and unmanned undersea vehicles to detect ships marine life marine geology and other underwater sound sources. The towed sonar array comprises a long cable that trails the employed vehicle when the array is deployed.

Acoustic sensing elements called hydrophones are placed throughout the cable. The hydrophones of the array can be used individually to detect sound sources but the real value of the hydrophones servicing the array is in the signal processing technique of sonar beamforming.

Sonar beamforming is a signal processing technique used in acoustic arrays for directional signal reception. The beamforming technique involves combining delayed signals from each hydrophone of the acoustic array at slightly different times so that every signal reaches the output of the array at exactly the same time making one loud signal as if the signal came from a single sensitive hydrophone. By properly selecting the delayed signals the array under consideration can effectively be steered to enhance the gain in one direction while decreasing gain in other directions. However the relative position of each individual sensing element such as the hydrophone should be precisely known in order to properly select each time delay.

In a towed acoustic array that is lying perfectly straight the positions are fairly straightforward to measure. However various hydrodynamic forces acting on a towed array as the array travels through the water induce enough movement in the individual sensing elements that a straight line approximation is no longer valid. Some techniques should be used to estimate the actual positions of the sensing elements and known so called shape estimators perform this function.

Typical towed arrays shape estimators perform an integration operation over a combination of parameters such as pressure depth and heading sensors positions located throughout the array along with tow ship and array physical parameters so as to calculate the positions of the sensing elements. Current techniques are able to provide acceptable error margins for the determination of these positions in most applications for towed arrays.

In addition to the consideration of the difficulties of the estimation of the actual position of the sensing elements one of the problems with towed arrays is their so called left right ambiguity. Without requesting the tow ship to perform maneuvers it is difficult if not impossible to know if a sound source is coming from the left or right side of the array being utilized. More particularly the beams that are generated by beamforming for an approximately linear array are conical in nature leading to an ambiguity that rotates a full 360 degrees around the array.

To combat the ambiguity problem some modern towed systems employ two or more arrays that are towed alongside each other. In this case proper beamforming can estimate the relative depth elevation and unambiguous direction of the sound source. In addition utilization of the two arrays makes the whole system able to identify a quiet source on one side of the array in the presence of a loud source on the other side of the array. The difficulty with this technique is that the shape of the array estimation becomes more critical.

Errors that could previously be tolerated in a single array may no longer be acceptable in a multiline system that employs multiple arrays. This non tolerance is more fully described by authors Cox H. Lai H. Heaney K. Murray J. 2003 in the technical article entitled Hybrid Adaptive Beamforming for Multi line Arrays discussed in 2003 and included in the 1858 1862. As an example for this non tolerance a two degree measurement error in heading may not be significant in a single line system but in a multi line system if the two degree measurement error occurs it may cause arrays to cross over each other which can be highly detrimental to the calculations being performed for the multi line system.

Accuracy requirements for a multi line towed acoustic array may be achieved by adding in a system for measuring line to line separation at discrete points along the arrays. Current systems do this acoustically using one array in one line as the transmitter and the other array in the other line as the receiver. Raw data is sent from the measurement station in each line of the array back to the tow vehicle where the two data sources are compared by means of an envelope correlator contained in the tow vehicle and used with the speed of sound in water to create a range estimate.

Measurement resolution is based on integration time and signal center frequency. As either of these two parameters increases resolution improves. Integration time is fixed due to the motion of the array in the water. As the signal center frequency increases the required data bandwidth servicing a hydrophone increases as well. To make useful measurements a single range measurement system in a modern multi line array may require sixteen or more times the bandwidth of a single hydrophone channel.

Since a number of stations are needed this required bandwidth puts an extreme load on the array data telemetry system. Depending on the particular array range measurement may require tens of kilo samples per second using conventional techniques. It is therefore desired that a ranging system be provided that uses the equivalent of only a few samples per second.

To avoid the problems associated with range measurement systems having high bandwidths a lower bandwidth alternative to sending raw data can be achieved if the measurement stations in all arrays are synchronized in time. In this case a unidirectional acoustic signal path is used. One array is the transmitter in one line and another is the receiver in the other line.

Since the receiver detects when the signal was transmitted because of the synchronization the receiver is able to calculate transmit time internally and send only the correct result by way of the array telemetry to the tow ship. This solution is not viable in many towed array systems for the reason that synchronization among the engineering sensors heading depth range is not always guaranteed or achievable. It is desired that a ranging system be provided for multi line towed acoustic arrays that does not require synchronization between its arrays while still achieving accurate measurements.

A further additional consideration for ranging systems for multi line towed acoustic arrays is the ability for the receivers in the source array of the towed arrays to be able to distinguish the arriving signals from 1 the transmitted signal emanating from the same hose of the multi array having provisions for carrying both arriving and transmitting signals and 2 the echo from different arrays when there is more than one repeater array present in the system. It is desired that a ranging system be provided for multi line towed arrays that correctly interprets arriving and transmitted signals carried by the same hose and also correctly interprets echo signals from repeaters in the array.

Another parameter of interest is the parameter of dissimilar stretches in the towed arrays. Towed arrays stretch when under tension and imperfect manufacturing tolerances may cause two towed arrays to stretch unevenly. This error called array skew increases toward the rear of the array being utilized. The amount of array skew may be calculated from the data that is collected for measuring separation of the elements of the array being utilized. It is desired that a ranging system be provided for multi line towed acoustic arrays that accommodates for array skew in its measurement technique.

Accordingly it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays having a low bandwidth thereby yielding a relatively low sampling rate for the data being utilized by the ranging system.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that is free of the need for synchronization among sensing and measuring elements.

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that yields data corresponding to the accurate locations of the sensors being utilized by the ranging system.

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that accommodates for array skew so as to yield accurate range measurements.

In accordance with the present invention an arrangement comprising a source array and an echo repeater array is provided. Each of the source and echo repeater arrays has a centerline. The source and repeater arrays are separated from each other relative to their centerlines by a distance and by an array skew.

The source array comprises a signal generator a transmitter providing an output and first and second receivers each receiving a signal. The echo repeater array comprises a receiver for receiving the output of the transmitter of the source array a configurable frequency shifter and a transmitter for transmitting a signal that is received by the first and second receivers of the source array.

The arrangement provides a system which measures the magnitude of the separation between the source array and the echo repeater array at a discrete point along the length of each array. The source array acts as the measurement source while the echo repeater array acts as a configurable frequency shifted echo repeater. The source array incorporates one sonar transmitter and two sonar receivers.

The configurable frequency shifter of the echo repeater array enables one measurement source to make measurements so as to cooperatively operate with multiple repeater arrays as in a multi line towed acoustic array system. The arrangement of the present invention among other benefits uses several orders of magnitude less digital data bandwidth than prior art systems while at the same time requiring no synchronization between the source array and the echo repeater array.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there is shown an acoustic ranging system that determines the distance between two towed arrays that is a source array and an echo repeater array . This determined distance is required as will be further described hereinafter to accurately perform adaptive beamforming used among other things to differentiate signals as arriving from the left or from the right of the pair of arrays and .

The source array has a centerline while the echo repeater array has a centerline . The source array and echo repeater array are separated from each other relative to their centerlines and as shown in by a distance and by an array skew . The source array has a signal generator and transmitter first and second receivers and whereas the echo repeater array has a receiver that has a configurable frequency shifter to be described with reference to . As seen in the signal generator and transmitter transmit an acoustic signal to the receiver and similarly the receiver transmits acoustic signals and respectively to receivers and .

The acoustic ranging system as will be further described hereinafter performs an operation without the need of high bandwidth data and without the need of synchronization between the source array and the echo repeater array while at the same time measuring separation and array skew both measured between the source array and the echo repeater array.

As seen in the signal generator and transmitter is comprised of a signal generator and transmitter which in actuality is a transducer. The signal generator provides first and second outputs and wherein the output is routed to a power amplifier which in turn provides an output that is routed to the transmitter .

The second output of signal generator is routed to a first timer and a second timer . The first and second timers and respectively receive input signals and to be further described hereinafter that respectively provide output signals and that are both routed to a microprocessor .

As further seen in the signal generator and transmitter provides an output signal also shown in via a transmitter that is an acoustic signal and is received by the receiver also shown in and in particular receiver shown in which in actuality is a second transducer. The receiver transducer provides an output signal that is routed to a first bandpass filter which in turn provides an output signal that is routed to a configurable frequency shifter .

The configurable frequency shifter is composed of an oscillator having a selectable frequency f and a mixer . The terminology for the configurable frequency shifter is used herein to represent that the frequency fmay be selected configured to meet the operational parameters of the system. The oscillator provides an output signal that is routed to the mixer .

The output of the configurable frequency shifter in particular the mixer provides an output signal that is routed to a second bandpass filter which in turn provides an output signal which in turn is routed to a second power amplifier . The power amplifier provides an output signal that is routed to a transmitter which in actuality is a transducer and which provides the acoustical signals and also shown in .

The receiver shown in in particular a third transducer receives the acoustical signal . The transducer produces an output signal that is routed to a third bandpass filter which in turn provides a signal that is routed to replica correlator which in turn provides the input signal to the timer as previously discussed.

The receiver in particular the transducer receives the acoustical signal and provides an output signal that is routed to a fourth bandpass filter . The bandpass filter provides an output signal that is routed to replica correlator which in turn provides the input signal to the timer as previously discussed.

In general and with reference to two arrays such as and from a multi line system are selected for measurement purposes. Once the arrays and are identified the signal generator and transmitter projects an acoustic signal by way of the transmitter transducer . The transmitted signal is received by receiver processed and rebroadcast back to be received by the first receiver and the second receiver by way of the acoustic signals and respectively. Calculations are performed by the microprocessor that generate the quantities array separation and array skew shown in . Someone versed in the art can generate these equations using simple geometry. The quantities array separation and array skew are transmitted via a low bandwidth connection provided by a conventional array telemetry system back to a signal processor not shown onboard the tow ship not shown .

More particularly and again with reference to in the source array an electronic signal is generated by the signal generator amplified by the power amplifier converted to acoustic energy by the transmitter transducer and transmitted through the water. At the same time the electronic signal generated by the signal generator by means of the operation of either timer the receiver and the microprocessor or the timer the receiver and microprocessor is put into an replica correlator contained in the signal processor onboard the tow ship that is matched to the frequency spectrum of the transmitted signal . In the receiver the transmitted signal is received filtered frequency shifted bandpass filtered amplified converted back to acoustic energy and transmitted as signals and and accepted by receivers and respectively.

The receivers and convert the acoustic signals and back to electronic signals filter and run the electronic signals through the replica correlators and respectively with parameters matched to the expected receiver frequency shifted signal created by the operation of the oscillator and mixer comprising the configurable frequency shifter .

The outputs from the now received quantities created by the configurable frequency shifter present at the replica correlator and are compared to those derived from the already existing quantities previously formed by the receivers and the replica correlators and timers and and calculated with the assistance of microprocessor .

The microprocessor is used to remove all fixed time delays and leave only the acoustic propagation time. This value is then transmitted by way of the array telemetry not shown to be interpreted onboard the tow ship not shown in the signal processing equipment not shown therein. The signal processing equipment via techniques known in the art calculates the distance between arrays and and also the array skew .

It should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that accurately measures the magnitude of the separation of a pair of towed acoustic line arrays at a discrete point along the length of each array while at the same time producing a measurement of the distance separating the arrays and and array skew .

It should be further appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that can operate regardless of synchronization of towed arrays engineering sensors known in the art with respect to each other.

It should also be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that may incorporate the feature that by calculating round trip acoustic propagation delay internal to the array comprised of the source array and the echo repeater array bandwidth requirements are decreased by several orders of magnitude regardless of signal center frequency being utilized

It should now be still further appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that allows for the capability to select high transmit frequencies so as to permit increased measurement accuracy.

Furthermore it should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that allows for the capability to select high transmit frequencies so as to allow shorter integration times and thus more range measurement samples per second.

In addition it should now be appreciated that the practice of the present invention provides an acoustic ranging system for multi line towed acoustic arrays that allows for the use of a configurable frequency shifter that permits tailoring of the principles of the invention to service several arrays at once as occurring in multi line configuration systems.

Moreover in addition to above described embodiments there are a few alternate configurations which can be included as part of the practice of the present invention such as 1 the horizontal component of array separation can be calculated from the absolute separation between arrays by incorporating values from nearby pressure sensors 2 additional receiver stations can be added to the source array to improve measurement accuracy 3 the signal generator can be reprogrammed remotely to upload new transmit signatures so as to better adapt the practice of the present invention to different environments 4 instead of transmitting back a frequency shifted version of what it receives the echo repeater array may have its own replica correlator and signal generator so that it can reply with any preprogrammed signature and 5 if there are only two arrays in the system such as arrays and the mixer and oscillator can be removed from the receiver to simplify the hardware and software implementation.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of that expressed in the appended claims.
