title: Optical imaging systems having input beam shape control and path length control
abstract: Scanning optical beam imaging systems for imaging a surface with convex curvature are provided. The systems include a sphero-telecentric objective, wherein a scanning radius of curvature of the sphero-telecentric objective is greater than an apical radius of curvature of the surface and less than or equal to four times an apical radius of curvature of the surface.
