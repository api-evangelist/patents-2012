title: Realization of energy savings potential through feedback
abstract: Feedback is provided to a user based on a setting for a set of energy consuming devices. While a user modifies a thermostat's schedule or provides user commands to adjust a setting for the set of energy consuming devices, a user interface component generates feedback to the consumer in response to an adjusted setting based on a condition for a predetermined function. A positive feedback component generates a positive feedback, such as a positive image in the user interface if the setting meets or exceeds a recommended performance metric for an operational parameter for the set of energy consuming devices. A negative feedback component generates a negative feedback, such as a negative image if the setting meets or exceeds a second condition, such as a discouraged performance metric.

The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 493 322 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ACHIEVING ENERGY SAVINGS POTENTIAL THROUGH FEEDBACK filed on Jun. 3 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This application relates generally to efficient energy management and to achieving energy savings potential through feedback.

Giving consumers hardware to lower their energy consumption alone is often not sufficient to produce the hardware s full energy savings potential. For example the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA has estimated that consumers could save approximately 20 on heating and cooling costs per year by properly programming their thermostats. However a recent investigation revealed that most people with programmable thermostats never program them and that a third of respondents put their thermostats in a long term hold. As a result capable hardware e.g. programmable thermostats alone fails to deliver possible energy savings potential.

The above described deficiencies of today s energy management systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding aspects of some of the various non limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.

A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary non limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings.

Other embodiments and various non limiting examples scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.

Embodiments and examples are described below with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details in the form of examples are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident however that these specific details are not necessary to the practice of such embodiments. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate description of the various embodiments.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus the appearances of the phrase in one embodiment or in an embodiment in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

As utilized herein terms component system interface and the like are intended to refer to a computer related entity hardware software e.g. in execution and or firmware. For example a component can be a processor a process running on a processor an object an executable a program a storage device and or a computer. By way of illustration an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and a component can be localized on one computer and or distributed between two or more computers.

Further these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon such as with a module for example. The components can communicate via local and or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets e.g. data from one component interacting with another component in a local system distributed system and or across a network e.g. the Internet a local area network a wide area network etc. with other systems via the signal .

As another example a component can be an apparatus with specific functionality provided by mechanical parts operated by electric or electronic circuitry the electric or electronic circuitry can be operated by a software application or a firmware application executed by one or more processors the one or more processors can be internal or external to the apparatus and can execute at least a part of the software or firmware application.

In an aspect a component can emulate an electronic component via a virtual machine e.g. within a cloud computing system.

The word exemplary and or demonstrative is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. For the avoidance of doubt the subject matter disclosed herein is not limited by such examples. In addition any aspect or design described herein as exemplary and or demonstrative is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs nor is it meant to preclude equivalent exemplary structures and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore to the extent that the terms includes has contains and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term comprising as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements. Additionally the word set or sub set is used herein to refer to one or more of a component or item in which the term modifies or refers to.

In one or more embodiments disclosed herein a system and apparatus receive user commands to adjust one or more settings for energy consuming devices e.g. an HVAC system home appliances and the like . In response to a setting being adjusted by the received user commands feedback is generated that is associated with the setting to provide information about the setting. For example information about the setting can be whether it is one that is recommended e.g. Environmental Protection Agency EPA recommendation a cost saving setting a carbon emission cutting setting and the like as related to the energy consumption and or costs of the home or a set of energy consuming devices of the home in which a set as referred to in this disclosure can mean one or more. 

A user is provided informational feedback e.g. positive feedback and or negative feedback based on whether a setting satisfies a pre defined condition including a first pre defined condition and or a second pre defined condition. For example in response to user commands modifying a setting to meet the first pre defined condition a positive indicator such as a checkmark a green image a sound animation haptic feedback or similar indicator associated with the setting is displayed or generated alongside or proximate to the setting. The indicator can be a positive indicator to indicate that a benefit is associated with the particular setting satisfying a designated performance metric such as an EPA setting for ENERGY STAR Residential Climate Controls for example.

Other performance metrics being met could trigger the generation of other feedback. For example a setting that would incur cost for the home due to an efficient use of energy devices during the day while at work can cause a smokestack a red image an X or some other image or message to the user that the associated setting is not an efficient use of energy generates greater costs or emission than necessary. For example the feedback includes but is not limited to an image a sound an animation and or a haptic feedback e.g. a motion or touch sense related feedback .

As an overview the various embodiments of energy consumption management herein include methods that can receive a set of user commands related to a set of energy consuming devices and generate in a user interface feedback related to the set of user commands. In response to the set of user commands initiating a setting to the set of energy consuming devices that meets a condition of a predetermined threshold a user interface component generates feedback to inform the user whether a setting is beneficial or not beneficial.

An apparatus for receiving user commands and setting operational parameters of energy consuming devices of a home generates feedback to a user in a user interface. For example the apparatus comprises a Programmable Communicating Thermostat PCT a Home Energy Manager HEM a demand response appliance Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning HVAC unit and the like device that receives settings based on user commands. The apparatus e.g. HEM includes a user interface component that can control the settings of one or more energy consuming devices such as dishwashers clothes washers dryers HVAC systems a pool pump other appliances that have detectable power levels and the like. The apparatus includes a processor having executable instructions. A feedback component generates feedback in response to the settings being set by the user commands. For example the feedback includes but is not limited to an image a sound an animation and or a haptic feedback. The feedback for example can be displayed alongside or proximate to each setting in the user interface. Based on the feedback the user is able to observe whether each of the settings satisfy a pre defined condition which can be an energy cost condition as configured based on a local utility company cost structure an emissions condition such as COemission a setting condition according to ENERGY STAR Residential Climate Controls a comfort setting based on a desired level of comfort or a user preference related to the energy consuming device a recommended setting for a particular energy consuming device a time of day associated with each pre defined condition and the like based on a function e.g. an operational function cost emission with respect to time or other variable . These embodiments and further embodiments are further detailed below.

In the following detailed description reference will be made to the accompanying drawing s in which identical functional elements are designated with like numerals. The aforementioned accompanying drawings show by vary of illustration and not by vary of limitation specific embodiments and implementations consistent with principles of the present invention. These implementations are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and it is to be understood other implementations may be utilized and that structural changes and or substitutions of various elements may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be construed in a limited sense. Additionally the various embodiments of the disclosure as described may be implemented in the form of software running on a general purpose computer in the form of specialized hardware or combination of both software and hardware.

The system comprises a controller for managing functions of the energy consuming devices and or such as power consumption within a household. The controller can be operatively connected for example to each of the power consuming features functions of the energy consuming devices and or . The controller can include a processor which is programmed to selectively send signals to the energy consuming devices and or respectively in response to input signals or user commands received. The energy consuming devices and or in turn are operable to manipulate a powering of the power consuming features functions thereof in response to the signals from the controller .

The controller is configured to communicate to control and operate the devices and which can comprise appliances and or thermostat controllers e.g. a programmable communicating thermostat in one of a plurality of operating modes e.g. a normal operating mode an energy saving operating mode cost saving mode a deferral mode etc. . In one embodiment the controller operates in response to user commands that are received for controlling the various devices and . User commands or inputs can alter a setting for a power consuming feature or function of the energy consuming devices and . Upon receiving a user command the controller can communicate a signaled setting to alter a function of one or more of the energy consuming devices and such as power consumption.

In another embodiment the controller indicates that a recommended setting or commands has been entered by generating feedback in response to the entered command. The controller for example comprises a data store a user interface component and a feedback component that is communicatively coupled thereto. The user interface component is configured to display feedback and to receive a set of user commands related to one or more settings of the energy consuming devices and . For example the user interface component can receive user commands or inputs directed to settings from a control panel or user interface controls e.g. touch screen controls external control mechanisms etc. . The user interface component can operate a display not shown and control buttons not shown for making various operational selections which both of which are further detailed infra. For example the display can be configured to provide active real time feedback to the user on the cost of operating each energy consuming device and in which the costs can be based on the current operating and usage patterns and energy consumption costs such as the cost per kilowatt hour charged by a corresponding energy provider. In response to the user commands received the user interface component operates in conjunction with and is communicatively coupled to the feedback component .

The feedback component is configured to generate feedback to a user via the user interface component in response to receiving a set of user commands or a selection of the set of user command as input. For example feedback is generated based in part on the received set of user commands adjusting the at least one setting to meet a pre defined condition. The condition for example can be based on a recommended setting a cost function an emissions function a power output a comfort level or range a termination schedule other schedule with respect to time an energy efficiency instantaneous power consumption aggregate power consumption for a time period a demand response or peak time schedule and any other programmed user preference setting for operating any of the energy consuming devices and of a home or other powered building structure.

In response to reception of the set of user commands the feedback component determines whether the received set of user commands adjust a setting of the energy consuming devices and to satisfy the pre defined condition discussed herein. Based on the determination made feedback is generated that includes an indication of a quality of an impact of the selection of the set of user commands based on the pre defined condition having been satisfied. The feedback is rendered then via the user interface component .

For example the feedback component is configured to generate feedback such as a positive or negative feedback e.g. an image sound animation haptic feedback or other feedback data that indicates a quality of an impact of the selection of user commands toward a pre defined characteristic of the system such as a pre defined positive characteristic of the system . For example a pre defined characteristic can be energy efficiency in which a pre defined positive characteristic can be an increase of energy efficiency a decrease in instantaneous power consumption a decrease in aggregate power consumption for a certain time period a decrease in operating cost avoiding a peak demand or demand response schedule from a utility costing more or resulting from additional generators during a peak time and the like for example. In one example a checkmark or other image is rendered proximate or alongside the setting entered by a user commands that satisfies a recommended EPA setting.

Further the feedback component is configured to generate negative feedback such as an X image or other data indicate the quality of the impact of the selection to be a decrease of the pre defined positive characteristic of the system with energy consuming devices based on the pre defined condition being satisfied or a pre defined negative characteristic which is opposite of the positive defined characteristic discussed above e.g. decrease of energy efficiency increase in instantaneous power consumption increase in aggregate power consumption for a certain time period increase in operating cost consuming energy during a peak demand or demand response schedule from a utility costing more or resulting from additional generators during a peak time and the like . For example when cost increases past a certain point for a particular setting the setting is contrary to an EPA recommended setting satisfies a discouraged setting that incurs a greater detriment via cost efficiency energy consumption etc then the feedback component can generate feedback e.g. an image animation sound haptic feedback etc. indicating that the quality of the setting is not good and is discouraged.

In one embodiment the image can reflect a quality such as a positive image for a positive impact on the system of energy consuming devices or a negative image for a negative impact. In addition the image could reflect the type of impact whether environmental cost comfort etc. based on the pre defined condition being satisfied associated with the setting in which different settings can have feedback based on different pre defined conditions for different functions and or different energy consuming devices.

In addition the controller can be configured with default settings that govern normal modes of operation energy savings mode operation and or other modes. Such settings in each mode can be fixed while others are adjustable to user preferences which could provide response to load shedding signals from a utility or energy provider. The user interface component is further configured for example to provide optimal settings or optimal schedules for settings that are fixed or predetermined and operate in response to a user command to execute any one of a set of predetermined schedules which is further detailed below.

In other embodiments the controller is operable to transmit signals received from a utility via smart meter or other means along to devices and connected to a home area network HAN or some other network for example. The controller can manage which devices shed load by entering into an energy savings mode or other power deferred state and collects home data about the home in a home database of a memory or data store for example. The data can be further stored into an aggregate home database such as the data store having home data from multiple homes. The home data can be collected and stored in the controller s memory on site via a query for public home data or from a private database of home data for homes sharing such information.

The controller is configured to gather information and data related to current energy usage patterns energy generation and or storage data. A carbon footprint can be calculated together with an energy profile of the home based on the characteristics of the utility generation mix and other fuels such as natural gas consumed by the home. This information can be used to determine current energy usage and cost associated with using each device appliance as well as provide information with a web browser of suppliers able to provide energy reduction devices information to save on energy usage increase generation at the home improve storage and or other savings tips for the home including recommendations for making changes to the home based on demographic information and home data as well as other recommendations. This real time information i.e. current usage patterns and or current power cost can be presented to the user via the user interface component.

Home data is merged together by the device controller acting as the central brain for the system and includes information about construction specifications such as geographical location home age size insulation information appliances within the home a number of rooms an orientation of the home obtained from a mapping database for example and or other public and or private residence data pertaining to the home. Private residence data includes past utility bills HVAC appliance data size ratings home expansion data window orientation number of floors number of residents and or any other type of private data related to energy usage of the home. Other data affecting the home stored in a home data base includes meteorological data such as temperature solar insolation data precipitation geographical weather wind patterns and or the like for example. Utility data pertaining to the home is also considered as home data gathered by the controller . Utility data includes information about usage cost history the generation of COby the utility generation mix or other emissions caused by the home and or data for similar residences having data available for comparison.

In one embodiment the system can comprise a server component with a web based application interface that presents all home data including current energy consumption historical energy consumption thermostat set points and schedule e.g. vacation schedule day week month schedules schedules based on season and other schedules with respect to time or utility demand schedules weather forecast information for determining optimal times to run certain devices generate energy on site and or store energy to the energy consumer user of the home.

In one embodiment the central controller operates as a data server embodied in a client application not shown . The central controller provides data received from devices within the home to the client application which in turns formats the data to be presented to the user such as in graphs or other type of displays. In another embodiment the controller operates as a web server for serving web based applications to a browser device and or a sending interface over an IP connection for a web based application.

In another embodiment the controller connects via either Ethernet or Wi Fi to the homeowner s router and to a client application in a personal computer and or a mobile device to access a network such as a cloud network or a wide area network e.g. an Internet . This allows for remote service and monitoring capability. A server can keep records of all homes therein that may be accessed remotely via the network .

In one embodiment the central controller compiles an energy profile and carbon footprint such as graphs from home data stored within the home data store for a home. The data store can be operable to be updated via the user interface component with demographic information regarding the number age sex and income of the residents as well as information about the occupancy patterns and other personal preferences related to the home. A carbon footprint is the total set of greenhouse gases GHG emissions associated with activities of an organization event or product. For simplicity of reporting it is often expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide or its equivalent of other GHGs emitted. An individual nation or organization s carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment. Once the size of a carbon footprint is known a strategy can be devised to reduce it e.g. by technological developments better process and product management changed Green Public or Private Procurement GPP carbon capture consumption strategies and others. The mitigation of carbon footprints through the development of alternative projects such as solar or wind energy or reforestation represents one way of reducing a carbon footprint and is often known as carbon offsetting.

The energy profile of the home can be based on home data such as physical and demographic data about the individual s home and or the carbon footprint. For example home data comprises data such as a geographical location as determined by GPS for example size e.g. square footage number of floors rooms age year of construction and an orientation of the home as provided by a mapping application on site generation data and or other public private residence data. Home data further includes meteorological data including local temperatures precipitation solar insolation data and wind trends. Utility data is also compiled such as historical energy consumption and cost history information emissions of carbon dioxide by the utility generation mix or other emission data for the given home and usage for homes that are similar based on similar construction age size orientation and or other physical and demographic data about the home.

The individual home data is compiled into an aggregate home database for multiple homes for a comparison to be made with the consumer s individual home and other similar type homes. The comparison results are presented to the user in a web browser or a client application for example on a client device. The aggregate home database could be stored on site in the memory controller and or the server . The comparison results of similar homes are used to make recommendations to the consumer of the home for saving energy costs and or reducing the carbon footprint. The recommendations include cost savings payback benefits financing options local supplier information on site generation methods and or devices for reducing cost carbon and or other emission associated with energy usage at the home. For example products services for reducing energy costs COemissions can be provided such as upgraded appliances suggestions hot water and or lighting upgrades. Other examples include HVAC upgrades or repairs geothermal solar thermal methods on site generation methods such as photovoltaic solar panels wind natural gas fuel cell options etc. that are available online or locally. Improvements such as building shell improvements are recommended. For example insulation types windows and other physical construction upgrade possibilities that may be of benefit to the consumer. Energy storage systems are presented that comprise battery hot water or cold storage methods. Energy audit services are also suggested for the local area for improving cost efficiency and or carbon offsetting.

Recommendations are provided for reducing overall net energy consumption and approaching a net zero energy condition. The evaluation would include recommendations regarding energy reduction and addition of on site power generation and or storage at the home. The recommendations are based on at least one of the comparison of similar type homes age geographical location cost home construction efficiency resident demographic data past utility billing information total power energy consumption of the home power energy consumption of individual energy consuming devices at the home generation produces available and or storage products available. A net zero energy consumption is when a home has a source of in home generation or storage and generates as much energy at the home as is consumed over the course of a time period such as a year. For example recommendations provided to the homeowner could provide the energy usage amounts over time to the user with in home on site generation data. If in home generation data e.g. solar generation or other on site home generation amount is less than the amount consumed by the set of energy consuming devices options available will be provided to improve any number of the characteristics making up the home s profile to increase efficiency cost and or generation of energy. For example age of the home may indicate that new windows could be provided by a certain local supplier suggested that would increase insulation by an amount to offset cost and the carbon footprint made by the home. Other products services suppliers could be provided that are available to the user such as newly marketed flexible solar panels or increased efficiency solar panels geothermal devices on site fuel cells windmills etc.

Referring now to illustrated is an exemplary control system for receiving user commands for initiating operational settings and generating feedback in response to the received user commands or initiated operational settings. The set of energy consuming devices and can include for example a refrigerator an HVAC system a demand response appliance configured to manage power consumption by responding to communication commands a dishwasher a dryer a washer an electric vehicle charger and or any other energy consuming device configured to operate at detectable power levels for a building structure or a home. Additionally the controller can comprise a programmable communicating thermostat a home energy manager a mobile device a website server and or other device that controls stores and or communicates operational data or home data related to the set of energy consuming devices and . The controller includes a command analysis component an optimization component a setting component and a comparison component that operate to generate feedback to a user or consumer. For example the command analysis component is configured to analyze a set of user commands received by the controller via the user interface component and generate an analysis of the received set of user commands with respect to a change from a first operational setting to a second operational setting of the set of energy consuming devices and display the analysis to the user via the user interface component . The feedback can include at least one of cost change and energy consumption change feedback related to the adjustment of the at least one setting. The calculations of the changes can be based on a thermodynamic model of a home or of the set of energy consuming devices. Alternatively the calculations for the feedback can fall to averages and heuristics when detailed data is not available as related to the set of energy consuming devices.

For example the controller can operate as a thermostat unit that can receive a set of user commands to adjust an HVAC unit to heat and or cool a home with an air pump and a heating component not shown . The controller could receive a set of user commands from a homeowner user or consumer that can initiate operational settings for the HVAC unit. The settings can include multiple settings for different times of a day different days different dates with respect to occupancy of the home with respect to timeframe or with respect to cost pollutant emissions demand response scheduling from the utility and the like. Upon receiving user command to modify alter or otherwise change a setting of the HVAC unit or any other energy consuming device the command analysis component could generate home data related to the energy consumption of the energy consuming devices and present the data to the user via the user interface component. The data for example can include a cost of adjusting a setting such as temperature from one temperature to a different temperature. The user thus stays informed and is able to make informed decisions as to whether to enter the setting to take effect in the operation of the HVAC unit.

In response to the user entering a setting with a set of user commands the feedback component generates feedback in the form of negative feedback or positive feedback to a user via the user interface component . For example in response to a user setting a temperature in the case of the HVAC unit example or some other setting at a recommended setting the feedback component generates a positive image such as a checkmark a leaf a healthy heart and or some other image to indicate a benefit e.g. comfort health environmental cost and or some other benefit . In one aspect the image is generated proximate to the setting displayed via the user interface component and thus complements or supplements the setting chosen. The settings can operate to control any number of performance metrics e.g. energy consumption of an energy consuming devices or any of the features associated therewith e.g. fan control pump speed flow control temperature fluctuation mechanical movement electrical generation etc. .

In one embodiment feedback is displayed or generated in conjunction with the user command being received or the inputted commands being entered and or stored. Various feedback images and or feedback data e.g. sound animation haptic feedback etc. is generated to complement the entered settings as discussed above in addition to negative images that can discourage a home owner from permanently or temporarily entering certain user settings based on a discouraged detriment recommendation or condition. For example in cases where high emissions could result from a hot day and or at a high demand time for electricity such as when reserve plants are provided in line for additional generation feedback could be provided in real time to a display that illustrates a negative benefit or a detriment to the user. For example a cloud a sad face an X and or some other image could be generated proximate to the entered user commanded setting in the display which could indicate that a detriment can incur with respect to time when the setting is left at a particular performance metric for operating any one of the energy consuming devices and . The discouraged detriment setting could be determined as a predetermined function of energy usage cost time energy consumption amount emissions output runtime etc. In one example when the consumer s settings achieve meeting exceeding falling below a designated performance metric such as the Environmental Protection Agency s settings for ENERGY STAR Residential Climate Controls a positive feedback image could be generated such as a star checkmark or the like. Further a negative image could be generated in response to a setting that does not achieve the condition or in other words the designated performance metric. As a result the feedback component generates feedback to a user of the controller via the user feedback component in response to a pre defined condition being satisfied equaling exceeding or falling below based on a predetermined function with respect to time cost emissions and or other variable and or a pre defined positive characteristic such as cost energy consumption emissions output runtime etc. The optimization component is configured to adjust a setting based on a set of predetermined operational programmed settings with predetermined schedules settings and the like that meet or exceed the pre defined condition discussed above. The condition for example can be a condition based on a recommended setting a cost function an emissions function a power output a comfort level or range a termination schedule other schedule with respect to time and any other programmed user preference setting for operating any of the energy consuming devices and of a home or other powered building structure. In addition the pre defined condition can reflect a quality of an impact of a selection for a setting of the user commands. For example the selected setting can be an increase of a pre defined positive characteristic of the system e.g. energy efficiency power consumption cost etc in which the pre defined condition is determined to be satisfied based on the increased setting. Alternatively or additionally a decrease can be evaluated based on the quality of the impact on the pre defined positive characteristic.

The processor or controller via the optimization component further facilitates adjusting at least one setting based on a set of predetermined operational programmed settings that meet or exceed the pre defined condition and in response to a user selection for the set of predetermined operational programmed settings. For example an optimized command could be received that enables a user to select a set of predetermined operation programmed settings that modify the set of energy consuming devices towards a net zero energy consumption and accounts for the pre defined condition including recommended settings for the set of energy consuming devices. In one example the controller can modify the set of energy consuming devices based in part on a set of user preferences including at least one of energy savings costs time and date. An optimization command can further enable all of these preferences to be applied automatically with a single user input command.

In one aspect a user input such as a single click or a single input operates to set one or multiple settings of the controller to operate the set of energy consuming devices and at an optimal performance metric or at various performance metrics as recommended by the feedback component and or based on the feedback generated by the feedback component . For example in cases where the feedback is generated as a negative image an optimal input control generated by the user interface component could be set by a single user input command or multiple user input commands to ensure that a programmed schedule of predetermined operational settings is maintained.

Additionally an optimal input or user input command can generate multiple settings for multiple energy consuming devices e.g. HVAC pool pump garden hose timers coffee makers other home appliances etc. that are all set based on various schedules of occupants of a home and to conserve energy cost emissions and or ensure safety while away from fire flooding shock and any other hazard.

In addition the controller can be configured with default settings that govern normal modes of operation energy savings mode operation and or other modes which can be programmed by a user or predetermined for user selection. The user interface component is further configured for example to provide optimal settings or optimal schedules for settings that are fixed or predetermined and operate in response to a user command e.g. an optimal input command to execute any one of a set of predetermined schedules as discussed.

The setting component is configured to set and display the settings of the energy consuming devices such as operational settings related to energy consumption or features of the devices that consume additional energy as measured by a meter or other sensor device not shown . In response to reception of a set of user commands via the user interface component the setting component is configured to adjust the setting of the energy consuming devices and so that each device having a modified or adjusted setting operates at the particular operational setting. For example a signal can be generated informing the devices and to operate at a different level or a signal directly controlling any of the energy consuming devices and can be generated such as with a regulator circuit or the like.

The comparison component is configured to receive home data related to the set of energy consuming devices and of a home and generate a comparison of the home data with home data of homes that are similar or meet a predetermined set of criteria such as similar size construction specifications e.g. age number of rooms etc. for example and or other criteria that match the home data of the home for the set of energy consuming devices and . The comparison component is further configured to display the comparison via the user interface component.

In one embodiment the comparison component is operable to generate a one time message a periodic message or message delivered at different intervals to the user with the comparison data of similar homes. For example a periodic email text or interface display can be generated to provide a user data from similar homes having similar construction and or that are within a certain geographical radius of the home with the set of energy consuming devices and . The comparison component can operate with a server component for example to generate an electronic message via a web browser or email client to the user with an energy profile of the set of energy consuming devices the comparison data cost saving recommendations carbon dioxide COemission data on each energy consuming device on site power generation data on site storage data e.g. type and capacity levels of charge and other information such as safety tips for improving energy awareness of the user s home.

Electronic messages can be sent by the controller or processor and or the server component to the client application and or to the network for access by a user of the device. In one embodiment the user can control settings remotely via the device and or and concurrently be provided the feedback from the feedback component thereat. A user can therefore continue to stay informed of the state of a setting and how it impacts the pre defined conditions discussed herein. In another embodiment the pre defined conditions are set by the user updated via the network or some other data source based on the user s preferences. In addition the feedback such as associated images and the like can also be altered similarly to the conditions for feedback.

Referring now to illustrated is an exemplary control system having the controller e.g. a processor for controlling feedback related to user commands for a set of energy consuming devices of a home. The feedback component includes a positive feedback component and a negative feedback component in order to generate feedback in response to an adjustment or setting of an operational setting for the set of energy consuming devices and . The feedback is generated based in part on user commands that adjust at least one setting to satisfy a pre defined condition e.g. satisfying at least one of a set cost a recommended setting a detrimental or discouraged setting a set power operation of a coupled device other performance metric and or other operational parameter .

In response to reception of the set of user commands the feedback component is configured to determine whether the received set of user commands adjust or the current setting satisfies a pre defined condition associated with the set of energy consuming devices. The pre defined condition for example can be an operational parameter of one or more of the energy consuming devices and such as a temperature or climate control in the case of an HVAC unit of a home. Further in response to a determination that an adjustment of the at least one setting is based on the received set of user commands satisfies the pre defined condition the feedback component generates feedback with the positive feedback component and or the negative feedback component . The feedback provides an indication of a quality of an impact of the selection of the set of user commands based on the pre defined condition having been satisfied which is rendered by the user interface component in a display view pane or screen of the display component .

The positive feedback component generate a positive feedback indicating the quality of the impact of the selection to be an increase of a pre defined positive characteristic of the control system based on the pre defined condition being satisfied. The positive characteristic can be an operational parameter and or a performance metric for example that characterizes energy efficiency instantaneous power consumption aggregate power consumption with respect to a time period operational cost peak demand periods vacation time date weather and the like. The pre defined condition can also be related to each of these examples such as a recommended EPA climate setting or some other set limit. Upon meeting or exceeding the pre defined condition feedback can be generated as a checkmark to signal that an EPA recommendation setting has been satisfied for a particular a setting category. For example a time away setting may be recommended as a pre defined condition to be below 55 degrees Fahrenheit but above 50 degrees Fahrenheit to keep pipes from freezing but to preserve cost efficiency in relation to the time for increasing the climate temperature of a home for returning home especially near the return home time entered.

Similar to the positive feedback component the negative feedback component generates feedback that indicates the quality of a user command setting selection of the system based on the pre defined condition being satisfied. The pre defined condition can be a second different condition than the condition of the positive feedback component and is pre defined based on similar characteristics as discussed above except that the feedback of the negative feedback component results from the selection being a decrease of the pre defined positive characteristic of the system e.g. an operational parameter and the like .

The pre defined condition includes the received set of user commands meeting or exceeding a performance metric of an operation parameter related to operation of at least one of the set of energy consuming devices. The feedback includes at least one of a positive image associated with the received set of user commands and a negative image associated with the received set of user commands satisfying the pre defined condition as determined by the positive feedback component and the negative feedback component .

The setting component adjusts and displays the at least one setting of the set of energy consuming devices in conjunction with the user interface component in a display component e.g. a display screen . The feedback e.g. a leaf checkmark heart cloud X etc. can be displayed next to the setting of a particular category or of the set of user commands to select from as well as alongside home data and or cost analysis data related to the new setting. The display can also include comparison data of the new setting with the old setting e.g. cost differentiation or other home data of similar homes based on similar criteria or some predetermined criteria.

Referring now to illustrated is a view pane or interface in accordance with various aspects discussed herein. A setting of a set of settings is illustrated next to a corresponding category of the set of categories . A feedback is generated and presented alongside or proximate to the setting . The feedback can include for example at least one of cost and energy consumption change feedback in response to the adjustment of the at least one setting.

Although temperature settings are displayed the settings are not confined only to a temperature setting as discussed above. A checkmark indicates that a setting satisfies a pre defined condition that includes a particular ENERGY STAR recommendation for example. Other images that can correspond to other settings and categories can also be generated to indicate to a user a quality of an impact for the setting on a positive characteristic such as an operational characteristic environmental characteristic and or cost benefit. Additionally a negative feedback image can be generated to indicate that a different condition falls below or is satisfied as being a detriment or a discouraged setting. For example an away setting could be below an acceptable or unsafe level for pipes freezing for a furnace pilot light or some other negative impact to the user or the environment.

An optimize input or command enables a single user input e.g. a click tap or any other input to be generated by a user to set a set of settings for all or a few of the various categories. For example each of the settings for each category could be predefined in a schedule that is initiated by the optimization component . These schedules may be user programmed or pre determined based on the pre defined condition for generating feedback images on the display. For example the optimize input upon being initiated can set all categories to meet or satisfy the ENERGY STAR recommendations.

Referring now to illustrated is another view pane or interface in accordance with various aspects discussed herein. A view pane presents emissions data based on the set of energy consuming devices of the home. For example COdata is provided with a meter that gives feedback as to the condition of the emissions. Other feedback can be provided as well in the view pane that is related to at home away or other periods of time e.g. a night time vacation time etc. feedback in which these options can be indicated by a specific color e.g. red or brightness to indicate a selection of data related to one of the options. In addition the meter can provide feedback related to the emissions for a setting that is operating during a period of time e.g. an at home time . For example a red on the meter can indicate a high emissions output relative to most homes or predetermined criteria of other similar homes. A rate of emission is also provided for a user to be conscious of his or her carbon footprint.

A view pane is generated to show a particular setting e.g. temperature and data that illustrates an impact of a change of the setting relative to some function such as cost energy consumption cost emissions safety etc. For example the feedback can include at least one of cost and energy consumption change feedback in response to the adjustment of the at least one setting. For example the command analysis component can generate an analysis of a received setting or user commands with respect to a change from one operational setting e.g. temperature or the like to another operational setting of the set of energy consuming devices and . The comparison data is then presented via the user interface component in the view pane such as cost changes energy consumption changes or emissions changes as a result of a change of operational setting. The view pane can provide comparison data in different colors depending upon the kind of feedback. For example a red color can indicate that the change is detrimental or that a pre defined condition has not been met or in green to indicate that the change is beneficial or that a pre defined condition has been met. Similarly other indications could be provided in relation to the color of the data in the view pane .

Another view provides a comparison of energy consumption with those of other homes or with other home data that can be based on similar homes having similar predetermined criteria as the user s home of the set of energy devices and via the comparison component . Home data is aggregated or received from the set of energy consuming devices and of a home and a comparison can be generated for display.

In one embodiment the home data can be presented with the energy profile the recommendations the COdata the runtime data the on site power consumption data the on site power generation data the comparison the on site storage data in a consumer application of a mobile phone or a personal computer via a web browser for example. In addition the electronic message can include whether and which one of the set of user commands adjusting the settings for the energy consuming devices meets the pre defined condition.

In one embodiment the recommendation or tip includes an input command control with the electronic message that enables an input to be received that activates a recommendation associated with the set of energy consuming devices. The recommendation or tip can be associated with any recommendation or tip for the home in general and or for the settings of any of the set of energy consuming devices for example.
