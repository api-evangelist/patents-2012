This disclosure relates in general to the field of computer management and more particularly to hardware based computer security management.

Computer systems management within modern enterprises and networks can include the use of tools and techniques for discovering attributes of the respective sub systems in the network. Security tasks and management can be performed for example by assigning and enforcing security policies against devices in the network. Policies can be assigned to particular devices based on known attributes of the devices for instance. Further gaining access to and or communicating with various devices in a network can include software based tools configured to enable communication of various data between different operating systems and devices. Further software based agents can be installed on various devices within a system to provide administrators with the ability to inspect control and perform tasks on the devices including security related tasks. Traditionally software based agents are installed through the operating system of the host device and the operating system is booted when the agent is active and able to communicate with management services utilizing and performing tasks through the agent. In such instances management of the host device can be considered dependent on the presence and operability of the host device s operating system and or the presence and operability and security of the installed agent.

Domains e.g. can include computing networks systems and environments such as a private home network e.g. ecommerce system search engine system social media system a network of a commercial or retail establishment e.g. Internet access points WiFi hotspots etc. and enterprise networks e.g. among other examples. Some system devices e.g. can migrate between and operate within multiple different domains e.g. including in some instances multiple environments simultaneously. Multiple secure identifiers can be generated for a single system device each secure identifier unique to the pairing of the system device with a particular domain. Additionally backend servers of the domains e.g. can be provided with functionality for negotiating the communication of the secure identifier as well as mutually authenticating the domain to the system device to ensure that only trusted entities are able to communicate directly with sensitive hardware based controls e.g. management controllers of the system device among other examples. In some implementations each domain e.g. can include a respective management system including functionality for identifying a hardware based management controller e.g. and interfacing and communicating with the management controller of system devices e.g. to obtain device information from the device and perform security and other device management tasks based on the received device information.

In some implementations a management controller e.g. can be present on the motherboard or chipset of the system device e.g. and be embodied on a microcontroller or dedicated processor independent of the central processing unit CPU and any operating system of the system device. A management server can thereby communicate in band or out of band with the system device through its respective management controller. In some instances a management server can provide an application programming interface API adapted to allow the management controller of the system device to interface with and receive and respond to instructions and requests of the management server. Such management services and tasks can include the negotiating of communication protocols and establishing of inter device associations between system devices on a particular network or domain. Management servers can additionally or alternatively include system security related APIs with the management server performing security related tasks for a network through the management controller of the system device.

In some implementations hardware based APIs can be established based on the provision of a secure identifier for a corresponding system device. For instance a secure identifier can serve as the basis of uniquely identifying and authenticating a particular system device e.g. in a home network domain . Secure hardware to hardware communications can then be enabled between system devices e.g. on the home network domain allowing a variety of different interactions between the devices. For instance interactions features interoperations and tasks can be enabled through such hardware based management controllers and management systems according to the principles and examples described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 718 043 entitled Hardware Management Interface and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 718 200 entitled Hardware Management Interface each incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In another example an enterprise system domain can include a variety of system devices e.g. . The enterprise system domain can utilize unique secure identifiers generated for each of the system devices to authenticate and uniquely identify the devices and apply security policies tailored to each of the devices. Domains can utilize secure identifiers and hardware based APIs e.g. authenticated to through the secure identifiers to enable to provide services based on a secured authentication of the device.

In general servers clients computing devices network elements hosts system type system entities and systems including system devices in example computing environment e.g. etc. can include electronic computing devices operable to receive transmit process store or manage data and information associated with the computing environment . As used in this document the term computer processor processor device or processing device is intended to encompass any suitable processing device. For example elements shown as single devices within the computing environment may be implemented using a plurality of computing devices and processors such as server pools including multiple server computers. Further any all or some of the computing devices may be adapted to execute any operating system including Linux UNIX Microsoft Windows Apple OS Apple iOS Google Android Windows Server etc. as well as virtual machines adapted to virtualize execution of a particular operating system including customized and proprietary operating systems.

User endpoint or client computing devices can include traditional and mobile computing devices including personal computers laptop computers tablet computers smartphones personal digital assistants feature phones handheld video game consoles desktop computers internet enabled televisions and other devices designed to interface with human users and capable of communicating with other devices over one or more networks e.g. . Computer assisted or smart appliances can include household and industrial devices and machines that include computer processors and are controlled monitored assisted supplemented or otherwise enhance the functionality of the devices by the computer processor other hardware and or one or more software programs executed by the computer processor. Computer assisted appliances can include a wide variety of computer assisted machines and products including refrigerators washing machines automobiles HVAC systems industrial machinery ovens security systems and so on.

While is described as containing or being associated with a plurality of elements not all elements illustrated within computing environment of may be utilized in each alternative implementation of the present disclosure. Additionally one or more of the elements described in connection with the examples of may be located external to computing environment while in other instances certain elements may be included within or as a portion of one or more of the other described elements as well as other elements not described in the illustrated implementation. Further certain elements illustrated in may be combined with other components as well as used for alternative or additional purposes in addition to those purposes described herein.

Detecting identifying tracking and managing assets in computing systems has traditionally been a significant challenge facing system administrators. A single unknown poorly understood or poorly monitored device connected to a network can potentially expose the entire system to a variety security threats and vulnerabilities including malware unauthorized data access rogue users etc. In some instances agents e.g. can be installed on system devices e.g. to assist administrators in obtaining a view of the attributes of the system device easily detect and communicate with the device on the network and enforce particular security policies on the system device. Unmanaged devices i.e. devices that do not possess an installed agent however may remain outside the communication control and monitoring of management systems designed to enable inter device communication and operation detect devices as they enter and leave the network apply policies to various devices and enforce security on the network can be hindered by not being able to effectively communicate with such unmanaged devices. Further installing agents on some devices can be difficult with the provisioning of agents jeopardized by the very dearth of information concerning the unmanaged device. Additionally unmanaged devices in some instances rather than being able to integrate into a network and be a benefit to the user or the network at large may be sent to a quarantined or managed sub network until the unmanaged device can be more carefully inspected by administrators have an agent installed on it etc. Additionally as more and more devices become smart in that they are increasingly controlled by computing processors include network communication adapters and are able to communicate with other systems the universe of potentially unmanaged devices continues to increase.

In addition security management can involve management of a wide variety of system devices including devices utilizing varying platforms and operating systems. At least some of the systems described in the present disclosure such as the systems of can include functionality that in some cases can address the above discussed issues as well as others not explicitly described herein. For instance to provide this level of functional support across the variety of system device platforms functionality can be provided below the operating system in the hardware through an example management controller e.g. . Such management controller functionality can be implemented for instance consistently across a variety of hardware platforms such as in connection with a family of chipsets capable of being utilized in a wide variety of system devices. A secure and trusted API can be provided based in hardware with remote accessibility capabilities enabling consistent and reliable access to security data and operations even in the absence of an agent or other such components.

While the characteristics and capabilities of hardware APIs between devices and domains can vary and evolve to accomplish a potentially limitless variety of tasks and provide a limitless array of potential features identity of a system device as rooted or based in hardware can serve as the atomic unit upon which such services can be built. In some instances in addition to providing functionality for generating secure identifiers for the system device management controllers can further enable access by remote servers to other trusted identity information. For instance turning to the example of a simplified block diagram is shown of a computing environment including an example system device and a domain management system of a particular domain . The particular domain can be one of several domains e.g. with which the system device can interact. Each of the domains can implement domain management systems employing principles similar to those of the domain management system of domain . Further in some instances the system device can interact with domains directly such as by connecting to a private network controlled by or associated with the domain e.g. or alternatively at least partially over public networks such as the Internet .

In one example implementation a system device can include a chipset that includes a processor such as a central processing unit CPU and memory such as memory including system memory utilized by the CPU and accessible to an operating system e.g. of the system device among other examples. The chipset in some examples can additionally include a management microcontroller that can provide secured processing functionality to perform management tasks outside of or below the control and instructions of the operating system. An example management microcontroller in some implementations can run a lightweight microkernel operating system that provides a low power out of band management controller. In some implementations a secured memory can be provided that is accessed and utilized by the management microcontroller to perform device management activities including the generation of secured identifiers for the system device . Secured memory can be separate from system memory and can be embodied as one example as a flash memory component of the chipset among other examples. Secured memory can include authentication data used by the management microcontroller to generate secure IDs for the system device and can in some instances include secure IDs themselves. Secured memory in some implementations can additionally include security posture data that describes attributes of the system device that is securely contained and insulated from being altered controlled or manipulated by users of the device the operating system or other entities including malware and hackers who might gain access to the device s system memory and or operating system among other examples. Additionally secured memory can additionally include store or point to instructions and software e.g. executed by the management microcontroller to provide the functionality of a management controller including the generation and management of secure IDs and security posture data among other examples.

In addition to secured processing and memory facilities system device can further include a communication manager that can be used to enable secured communication channels between a management controller and domains and their respective domain management systems. In some implementations communication manager can be implemented in connection with management microcontroller to permit the management microcontroller to access networks while the operating system of the system device is inactive absent etc. Accordingly management microcontroller can have direct access to network interfaces of the system device. In some implementations management microcontroller can run a fully independent out of band communication channel such as through a dedicated TCP IP stack allowing the microcontroller to inspect and receive packets not processed by the CPU as well as inspect inbound and or outbound traffic before the CPU has access to it. Effectively two logical network connections can be maintained on a single physical networking connector of the device one in band through the CPU e.g. and the other out of band through the management microcontroller . Network filters in communication manager can be utilized to programmatically redirect traffic to either a host operating system interface or the interface of the management controller at micromanagement controller for instance based on port numbers among other implementations. An independent network communication channel can allow the management microcontroller and management controller implemented using the management microcontroller to perform a variety of communications and remote management functions that can take place effectively potentially at all times without regard to the state of the operating system for example.

Management microcontroller can utilize independent and or dedicated network communication channel s to communicate with outside systems including management systems e.g. of domains e.g. over one or more networks e.g. network of domain etc. . The management controller of the system device and domain management system e.g. can mutually authenticate in connection with their interaction session APIs etc. In one example implementation one or more certificates e.g. can be maintained corresponding to a certificate authority that issues the certificate to domains for use through their respective domain management systems evidencing that the domain is legitimate trusted and meets thresholds for qualifying as a domain authorized under the certificate to interface and communicate with hardware based management controllers. Such certificates may be specific to a particular make model or implementation of a management controller in some implementations. Before communicating sensitive information to a domain management system a management controller can verify that the corresponding domain management system possesses a copy of the certificate e.g. or is still an authorized holder of the certificate e.g. based on a query to the certificate s authority . The management controller can in turn provide a secured identifier of the system device to authenticate the system device at the domain.

In some instances certificates e.g. can be maintained on management controller accessible memory e.g. together with security posture data authentication data and other information. Management controller accessible memory e.g. can also be written to by the management microcontroller. In some implementations management controller accessible memory e.g. can be non volatile protected memory in that other hardware components of system device and the operating system of the system device cannot access the memory thereby ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information stored in secured memory . Further in addition to protected management controller accessible memory e.g. management microcontroller can in some implementations additionally access system memory e.g. allowing the management controller to access additional information concerning attributes of the system device such as applications e.g. of the system device security tools and countermeasures e.g. deployed on the device activity and history of the system device geolocation information for the device user profiles of the system device networks used or connected to by the device etc. Such information can be used in the generation of security posture data securely contained within the system device s hardware in some implementations. Further in some examples a management controller can be further configured to manage the secure provisioning of agents software updates security tools and other programs features and data onto the system device to enhance the functionality and security of the device among other examples.

An example domain management system can be embodied in computing devices servers and facilities of a domain to manage interaction with hardware based management controllers of system devices connecting to and participating in the domain. For example an example domain management system can include one or more processors one of more memory elements among other tools and components such as a controller manager asset manager policy administrator and agent manager among other potential components. A controller manager can provide functionality for identifying authenticating and managing sessions with one or more system devices e.g. attempting to make use of hardware based management controllers in connection with the devices interaction with the domain e.g. . For instance a controller manager can manage mutual authentication of a domain e.g. and system device e.g. for instance validating to the system device that it has been issued a certificate by a trusted authority and accepting and managing secured identifiers and other information from the system device. Further the controller manager can manage the system devices with which it has communicated including those engaging the domain using a hardware based management controller. For instance controller manager can maintain secured identifier data mapping secured IDs to individual system devices utilizing hardware based management controllers.

Asset data can also be maintained or made available to an example device management system the asset data describing attributes of a plurality of assets included in or identified as accessing the domain including system devices having hardware based management controllers e.g. . Asset data can be collected from a variety of sources including installed agents on the individual assets scans of the assets e.g. by various security tools local and or network based scanners etc. as well as from security posture data and other attribute data received via communications with assets utilizing hardware based management controllers. Assets can include system devices networks applications data structures as well as human users making use of included in and or administrating systems of the domain. Further secure identifiers of client system devices can be maintained together with and or mapped to profiles in asset data among other examples.

In addition to a policy manager providing functionality for dynamically assigning policies to particular system devices and enforcing these policies in some implementations a policy manager can further include functionality for defining new policies modifying existing policies establishing rules and criteria for applying policies to particular system devices e.g. based on detected attributes of the devices and so on. A policy manager can operate in cooperation with one or more security tools deployed within the network and locally on the system devices themselves. For instance some security tools can be deployed remote from a system device allowing for policy enforcement to take place remote from the target system device application or person thereby allowing security enforcement without the policy or enforcement being pushed to the target itself. This can be useful for instance in the security enforcement of mobile devices that move on and off of a monitored network as well as unmanaged devices such as devices not including agents or other local security tools capable of enforcing important security policies. Such security tools can include for example firewalls web gateways mail gateways host intrusion protection HIP tools network intrusion protection NIP tools anti malware tools data loss prevention DLP tools system vulnerability managers system policy compliance managers asset criticality tools intrusion detection systems IDS intrusion protection systems IPS and or a security information management SIM tool among other examples. Nonetheless security enforcement is also possible locally on a target system device for instance through security tools running loaded or otherwise interfacing directly with the system device. Security tools can further provide the management controller in some instances with an interface for enforcing policy directly at the target device. For instance in some examples agents deployed on system devices can serve as a security enforcement tool for instance blocking particular activities locally at the device according to one or more security policies applied to the particular system device passing policy instructions to other security tools on the particular system device among other examples.

Attribute information included in asset data can be used to determine policies to be applied to the individual asset. A policy manager can be provided managing the development and enforcement of policies within a domain e.g. . In some instances policies can be tailored to the individual asset based on the asset data. In other instances pre developed policies can be matched to assets based on the asset data. Policies can include security and compliance policies among other policies used to manage and govern a domain. For instance access to data applications services and other resources of the domain security tasks audits scans countermeasure deployment updates and other actions can be performed based on adherences to policies among other examples. Further for system device assets utilizing hardware based management controllers policy enforcement can attempt to leverage the management controllers to perform such tasks. As one example information can be obtained from a system device allowing the domain management system to identify drivers for the system device that can be downloaded or otherwise identified and accessed to permit the domain management system to better communicate with and coordinate communication with the system device as well as communication between the system device and other computing devices within the domain.

In another example a domain management system can include an agent manager adapted to assist in the loading of agents on to various assets within the domain. In some implementations an agent manager can be used to load an agent onto a system device through a hardware based management controller. The agent can then be used to assist in managing and identifying the system device. In some implementations an agent manager can assist in loading persistent agents on the system device while in other examples temporary dissolvable agents can be loaded for instance corresponding with a given session between the system device e.g. and the domain .

The loading of agents is but one of a potentially unlimited number of tasks and services that can be performed securely and effectively through a hardware based management controller interfacing with a trusted domain management system to improve security operability and the feature sets of both the domain and the system device. Indeed managed system devices e.g. devices already having an agent can themselves be improved through the provision of a hardware based management controller. For instance when an endpoint is altered due to re imaging operating system reinstallation hardware updates new disk or new network cards or simply uninstalling the agent among other examples the ability to identify the system and install a new corresponding replacement agent can be based on re identification of the system device based on its secured ID. This can also benefit provisioning of appliances either within a third party domain e.g. a customer environment or in the cloud as the identity of a system device can be reliably and consistently verified. In addition insuring that the device is in a known state during the boot phase can provide an additional data point that represents the trust level of the device prior to performing any sensitive tasks involving the device. Among other additional examples lying endpoint attacks can threaten to compromise the integrity of an endpoint system device by calling into question the validity of the agent data being reported. Through a hardware based secure ID generated through the hardware based management controller this entire category of problems can be negated due to the ability to reliably validate the identity of the system device.

Further the security state of a system device can be extrapolated based on trustworthy security posture data e.g. to help refine the assessment of the risk that a particular asset poses to the environment before granting it access to the network. As another example network monitors such as firewalls intrusion detection systems intrusion prevention systems and other security tools can be improved by leveraging trustworthy secure ID data rooted in hardware in lieu of or as a supplement to other less persistent or spoofable identifiers such as an IP address MAC address or the like. Through the secure networking capabilities of some implementations of management controllers out of band network access to the security posture data and other resources of the secure memory e.g. can be enabled allowing for still additional features and services including the performance of support and diagnostic tasks while the main processor system memory operating system etc. are unavailable or not operable among other examples and advantages.

Further attribute information described in security posture data stored at the system device can be communicated to an authenticated domain management system using a management controller. Such information can include information identifying the type of system device and computing equipment on the system device allowing the management system to either identify and or retrieve device drivers corresponding to the system device. The attribute information in one example can include the identification of the make model and manufacturer of the system device s computing equipment and or the system device itself. The attribute information can also include identification of firmware operating systems and other software used by the system device s computing equipment including version information. Using the attribute information management system e.g. using controller manager can identify sources including remote sources serving device drivers updates and other information for the system device and or its computing equipment. Such information can then be used to perform various security related tasks and improve transactions with the system device.

Turning to the example of a simplified block diagram is shown illustrating that a single system device can maintain and provide multiple unique secure IDs e.g. each secure ID corresponding to and unique to a particular pairing of the system device with a different respective domain e.g. . The system device through hardware based management controller can generate or identify the secure ID corresponding to a particular domain and communicate the secure ID e.g. outside the access and control of the device s operating system to the domain such as to a domain management system of the domain among other examples. The domain can then authenticate and identify the device from the secure ID.

Turning to the examples of example flow diagrams are illustrated showing example techniques in the generation and use of secure IDs for an example system device. In particular software of a system device such as applications within the operating system of the system device can request a transaction with a domain e.g. at domain interface . The domain can utilize a domain manager referred to elsewhere herein as a domain management system to request whether the system is capable of providing a trusted hardware based secure ID for instance through a secure hardware based management controller e.g. of the system device. The request can also direct the system device to provide the secure ID to authenticate the system device at the domain. In the particular example of the system device returns a response to the domain denying the request .

A denial e.g. can result from a variety of factors. In some instances the domain may not have a valid certificate recognized by the system device e.g. using management controller as indicating that the domain is a trustworthy partner for communicating with the management controller provisioning and or sharing of a secure ID of the system device sharing of security posture data with the domain etc. In another example the system device may not be equipped with a management controller compatible with the domain and its request . In still other examples a secure session involving the management controller of the system device and the domain can be user directed. For instance in response to receiving the request a user interface can be presented to the user on the system device requesting approval to engage the management controller to set up a secure hardware to hardware communication between the system device and domain. In such instances a user can freely elect to deny the domain the privilege of interfacing with the management controller of the system device among other examples. In such instances the system device can attempt to engage in a traditional session with the domain e.g. transactions without the assistance or features of a management controller and a secure session established using management controller and domain manager . Further in some instances a user can additionally define or set rules and or preferences for the session e.g. through a provided graphical user interface . For instance a user can set rules preferences or parameters for establishing what security posture data and types of data can be shared with the requesting domain e.g. in some cases varying the amount of data that is shared based on the particular identity of the domain establishing whether the management controller can automatically attempt to join a secure session with a domain or subset of user identified domains e.g. by skipping a user authorization step among other examples.

In the example of in response to the denial to establish a secure session with the domain manager the domain manager can cause a set of policies to be applied to the system device. The set of policies can be default policies for any such system device or similar model of system device that does not or cannot provide the enhanced identification services of a secure ID and secured communication channel using a compatible management controller. Such policies can include security policies ecommerce policies etc. that result in a user of the system device enjoying a reduced level of access to the domain its services data promotions etc. In some instances the requested transaction e.g. at of the system device can be conditioned on the exchange of a valid secure ID the denial resulting in denial of the requested transaction by the domain. In other examples such as the example illustrated in the requested transaction can still be carried out e.g. despite the denial and the stricter policies such as more restrictive security policies being applied to the system device during the transaction .

Turning to the example of another transaction request is forwarded from software of a system device to a domain resulting again in a request for a secure ID from the system device. In this example for instance in response to a user approving a secure session with the domain at the system device the device software can query e.g. at the management controller to determine whether a secure ID is available for the requesting domain. In one example implementation a secure ID can be based on seed data received from the domain wherein the management controller combines additional authentication data with the seed data or applies a particular algorithm securely entrusted and executed at the hardware based management controller to generate a secure ID based on the seed data. In some instances the secure ID can be in the form of a one time password unique to the pairing of the domain with the system device. In the example of the management controller can determine that no seed exists for the requesting domain and communicate this result e.g. at to the system device software. This can indicate in some instances that no pairing as yet been established between the system device and domain.

As shown in the example of the system device can communicate e.g. at to the domain that no seed has yet been received from the domain but that a secure session is desired with the domain. The system device using management controller can then negotiate a secured exchange protocol with the domain in order to facilitate the secure and secret communication of the domain seed to the management controller of the system device protecting the seed from being identifiable to the operating system of the system device as well as third party snoopers among other examples. In some implementations in order to mutually authenticate the domain e.g. the domain manager of the domain to the system device the domain manager can additionally send a domain certificate e.g. issued by a trusted certificate authority to the system device in connection with the domain specific seed e.g. sent at using the negotiated secure channel e.g. established at . The secure channel can be further used to provision a domain seed unique to the pairing of the system device and domain on the management controller of the system device. Consequently copies of the seed can be persistently stored at each of the domain manager and the management controller following the provisioning of the seed on the management controller . The seed can be stored as authentication data for the domain in secure memory of the management controller . The management controller can then use the seed to generate a one time password based on the seed that the management controller can communicate to the domain manager. The form of the one time password can be negotiated and agreed upon between the management controller and domain manager . In one example the one time password can be generated by concatenating or hashing a combination of the seed and a domain identifier such as a four byte domain ID. The domain ID can be included for instance in the certificate communicated to the management controller . In another example the one time password can be based on a hash or concatenation of a system clock value with the seed.

Upon receiving the one time password or other secure ID generated from the seed at the management controller the domain can verify that the system device participating in the session with the domain is the same system device to which the seed was communicated based on the one time password. Based on the identification and authentication of the system device any security posture data transmitted by the management controller and attribute information otherwise gathered from the system device policies can be applied by the domain manger on the system device during transactions between the system device and domain manager. In some implementations authentication of a system device at a domain via a secure ID based on a domain seed e.g. can result in more permissive policies being applied to the system device in the domain in some instances enhancing the access permissions services and features available to the system device during the transaction session with the domain.

Turning to the example of a subsequent transaction between the system device and the domain is represented. In this example the domain seed provisioned on the system device remains stored in secured memory of the management controller as well as in memory of the domain manager . Additional authentication data can also be stored in secured memory of the management controller such as a domain ID of the domain corresponding to the seed . The transaction can be requested by the system device triggering a request by the domain manager for a secure ID of the system device. In some instances a user can be presented with an option to engage in a secured session with the domain while in other instances the user can indicate that following provisioning of the seed future sessions with the domain should be automatically secured without direct user approval among other examples and alternatives. Further the management controller can be queried for whether a seed has been provisioned for the requesting domain. The management controller can respond to the query by identifying the seed in secured memory and replying that the seed has been provisioned. The management controller and domain manager can again negotiate and establish e.g. at a secured channel for communicating the secure ID of the system device. Alternatively a previously negotiated secure communication protocol can be identified and applied to establish a secure communication channel between the management controller and the domain manager . Additionally to authenticate the domain manager to the system device the management controller can re verify the domain certificate of the domain for instance by determining whether the certificate is from a valid certificate authority and determining whether the domain remains a valid holder of the certificate e.g. by checking a listing of approved or alternatively rogue domains identified by the certificate authority among other examples .

Upon authenticating the requesting domain manager and establishing a secured communication channel the management controller can generate an instance of a one time password based on the seed and communicate the one time password to the domain manager . The domain manager can also independently generate the one time password and compare it against the one time password received at from the management controller to authenticate that the management controller is indeed a holder of one of the seeds e.g. previously generated and provisioned on the system device with which the domain has a pre existing relationship e.g. as established in the example of . Accordingly the domain manager can identify or re identify security policies corresponding to the system device identified by the seed based secure ID e.g. the one time password and apply the security policies to the system device during transactions completed with the system device during the secure session established between the management controller and domain manager .

In some implementations multiple different seeds including seed can be stored on secure memory of a management controller each seed corresponding to a particular pairing of the management controller s system device and a respective domain. In some implementations seeds and other authentication data in secured memory cannot be tampered with or modified and can persist in memory to survive system wipes operating system installations and the like affecting other memory of the system device. In order to protect privacy of a user however a user can cause the management controller to reset or delete seeds and other authentication data in secure memory including a full reset of all secure IDs authentication data and other identifiers in secure memory. For instance upon selling or otherwise disposing of the system device the user may wish to wipe hardware based secure IDs so that another user is not able to utilize previous secure IDs used by the former user to authenticate to the profiles associated with the former user within certain domains among other examples.

Other types of secure IDs can be used and generated by a management controller. For instance secure IDs can be generated from a persistent hardware identifier of the system device in lieu of or in addition to a collection of seeds provided by the domain and stored in connection with the management controller. For instance secure IDs can be generated according to the principles and examples described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 726 140 entitled Hardware Based Device Authentication filed on Dec. 23 2012 and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety among other examples.

As described above a domain manager can authenticate a client device e.g. including a management controller and tailor policies and services based on the authentication using the secure ID. The domain manager e.g. can further determine whether the secure ID has been previously received at the domain or is a new secure ID within the domain. In instances where the secure ID matches a previously received secure ID the domain manager can identify a pre generated profile and profile data corresponding to the secure ID and re associate the system device with the profile based on the secure ID. Such profile data can be generated from and describe aspects of previous authentications interactions preferences and transactions between the domain manager and management controller including attributes describing characteristics of the user of the client device. For example a profile record can be used to collect and store security data describing security related attributes of the client device and or user associated with the management controller and secure ID. Other attributes can also be recorded in a profile record and associated with the secure ID including for example session information user profile information browsing history account information etc. corresponding to and collected during the system device s interactions and transactions in the domain e.g. using the management controller . In this manner the domain manager can reliably identify the use of a particular system device within the domain based on the secure and trustworthy secure ID. The domain manager may then as in other examples determine security policies and other policies tailored to the attributes of the system device and apply these policies to the system device in transactions within a secure session between the management controller and domain manager .

In some implementations a system device through management controller can concurrently participate in multiple secure sessions with multiple different domains e.g. Domains A and B . In some implementations a management controller can maintain session data identifying a session secure communication parameters of the session e.g. the exchange protocol used keys and encryption schemes used etc. the domain involved in the session together with the authentication status domain identifier etc. among other data for tracking the domain session and corresponding secure ID to be used during the session.

It should be appreciated that in some implementations a management controller can be configured to derive secure IDs according to multiple different protocols and schemes. For instance in some implementations a management controller can be configured to both derive secure IDs based on seed data received from domains and derive secure IDs from hardware based hardware ID data e.g. as described in examples of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 726 140 entitled Hardware Based Device Authentication . For instance both a root ID for use in hardware ID based secure IDs and seeds e.g. 443 can be stored and maintained by a management microcontroller in secure flash memory and used to generate secure IDs for one or more domains among other examples.

As noted in the above examples secure communication channels can be negotiated and established between a management controller of a system device and domain manager of a domain. In some instances the negotiation of the exchange protocol used to establish the secure communication channel can include the passing of certificates and other data identifying the domain for use by the system device in authenticating the domain manager for interactions with the system device s hardware based management controller. In some example implementations key based encryption can be utilized to secure communications between a domain manager and management controller. Further in some implementations a secure key exchange protocol can additionally be used to securely exchange the keys used in the encrypted channel. The channel can be secured to hide the content of secure IDs seeds authentication data security posture data and other information transmitted from or to the management controller from other components processors applications operating systems etc. of the system device. In this manner data communicated by the management controller to the domain can be protected from manipulation or influence by users applications or other entities attempting to compromise advertently or otherwise the legitimacy of data maintained by the management controller.

In some implementations a key exchange protocol can be utilized that permits mutual authentication and secure key exchange in connection with the establishment of a secure communication channel between a management controller and domain manager. In some implementations a protocol can be used that is both secure e.g. from man in the middle unknown key share identity misbinding and other attacks and maintains privacy of the identity of at least one of the parties e.g. the management controller in this example . In one example implementation an encrypted communication channel can be established between a management controller and domain manager utilizing a SIGMA key exchange protocol or other protocol that establishes secret shared keys through a sign and mac mechanism as well as principles of Diffie Hellman exchanges. For instance turning to the example of a simplified flow diagram is shown illustrating an example SIGMA exchange between a management controller and domain manager permitting the negotiation of secure IDs outside the influence of the software of the system device. In the example of system device software provides a public value S. The value S can include in some instances a public base gof the management controller . In response the domain manager can send S confirming the request for the secure ID and including g B SIG g g MAC B where gis the public base of the domain manager B is the public key of the domain manager SIG g g is the signature of gand g and MAC B is the mac of B. In response the management controller can send S including A SIG g g MACK A as well as in some instances the secure ID encrypted using the key B of the domain manager.

Turning now to the example of a simplified flow diagram is shown illustrating a hardware based management controller s involvement in the secure communication and management of security posture data and other data describing attributes of the system device. For instance as in previous examples a domain manager in response to a system device s attempt to initiate one or more transactions with the domain e.g. at domain interface can attempt to initiate a secure session with the system device through a request for a secure ID of the system device. A secure communication session can be established and the certificate of the domain can be verified in connection with an authentication of the domain. Using approaches similar to those of the examples of as well as other approaches a secure ID can be derived by the management controller and communicated to the domain manager . In the example of upon establishing a secure connection with the domain manager the management controller can additionally pass at least a portion of security posture data over the secure channel to the domain manager . In some implementations the portion of the security posture data can be communicated together with the secure ID as a security container structure allowing the domain to more directly identify and bind the security posture data to the system device profile identified through the secure ID. Such containers can apply principles and examples described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 726 167 entitled Trusted Container filed on Dec. 23 2012 among other examples.

Security posture data can include a variety of data describing attributes of the system device. In some instances security posture data can describe persistent attributes of the system device such as identifiers of the model and manufacturer of the chip set identification of the system device system device type etc. and other information. Such persistent attributes can in some examples be pre loaded e.g. at manufacture onto secure memory of the management controller. Other data may describe more dynamic attributes of the system device. For instance the management controller can access and query system memory peripherals of the system device other processors of the system device the operating system of the system device and other system device entities to identify and collect other attributes of the system device. Such collected attributes can also be added to and included in the security posture data. Additionally the management controller can additionally monitor and identify updates and changes to attributes of the system device and capture these changes in security posture data.

As with seeds root IDs and other authentication data maintained in secure memory of the management controller security posture data describing various attributes of the system device can be isolated from control or influence of the user operating system third parties etc. thereby providing a secure and trustworthy repository or container for recording the attributes of the system device that may be useful in sharing with domains with which the system device interacts. Sharing e.g. at security posture data can permit the domain manager to better identify aspects of the system device influencing which policies such as security policies are applicable to the device and allowing the domain manager to better tailor application of the policies to transactions involving the system device and domain. Such transactions can include not only software based transactions e.g. but also hardware to hardware transactions such as transactions between the management controller and a domain manager .

Turning to an example trusted secure container is shown in accordance with one example implementation. The secure container can package the secure ID of the system device in the domain together with a set of security posture data to be communicated to the domain manager for use in introducing the system device to the domain manager for instance at the beginning of a secure session or when providing an API between the domain and management controller. In one example implementation the set of security posture data can describe one or more system device attributes such as boot policies of the system device an OEM public key hash for the system device among other examples. Indeed a variety of security posture attributes can be included in security posture data maintained by the management controller and capable of being shared with one or more domain managers. For instance the operating system type version patches etc. can be identified and maintained in security posture data together with the applications installed on the system device. In some instances security posture data can also identify the countermeasures and security tools deployed on the system device. An identification of user profiles use history and statistics behavioral information and other information describing users of the system device can also be collected e.g. from other sensors collecting such data on the system device . Additionally security profile data can described attributes including geopositional information collected from the device e.g. from global positioning system components of a system device present operating state of the device can be identified e.g. whether the device is on off battery charge level etc. the mode of the device e.g. how the device is being used collected for instance from accelerometers or other components of the device .

Some of the attributes included in security posture data can be highly device dependent. For instance a system device such as an in dash computer of an automobile can include information describing the functions and state of the automobile as monitored by the computer. Similar state information can be collected by management controllers included in the chipsets of smart appliances. As should be appreciated the types of attribute data that can be potentially collected and maintained in security posture data can be as varied and diverse as the ever expanding variety of smart devices personal computing devices peripherals and other devices including networking and computer processing capabilities.

The portion and type of security posture data that is shared by a management controller can vary from domain to domain. In some instances the management controller can identify a minimum amount of information requested by the domain and provide only this minimum set. In addition to an initial set of security posture data e.g. as encapsulated in a trusted secure container the management controller can utilize the secure session to communicate additional security posture data on an as needed or as requested basis to the domain based on the types of interactions between the domain and the system device. For instance a transaction involving the system device s consumption of a particular service provided by the domain can call for specific types of information concerning the system device included in security posture data.

Security posture data can provide an up to date and trustworthy accounting of attributes of the system device that are relevant to a domain s assessment of the security of the system device. Based on the attributes of the device as communicated in security posture data a domain can better appreciate the vulnerabilities and security profile of the system device allowing the domain to more accurately and comprehensively apply security policies and take preventative measures to account for the weakness or strength of the system device s security profile. Indeed while in some instances a secure session between a system device and a domain can result in more permissive policies being applied to the system device in other instances upon receiving security posture data from the system device indicating critical vulnerabilities or other troubling attributes the domain may actually apply more restrictive policies to interactions with the system device based on the security posture data.

The management controller can derive a one time password from the seed. The derived one time password can be a password that can be deconstructed by the particular domain to identify the secret seed and thereby authenticate that the computing device is the same device on which the seed was originally provisioned. In some instances the one time password can be derived based on a combination such as a hash of the seed and another value known to both the management controller and the particular domain such as an identifier of the domain an identifier of the device system clock value counter value date or code word among other potential examples. In some implementations a different one time password can be generated from the seed each time the system device attempts to join a secure session with the particular domain. The one time password is communicated over a secure connection established between the system device and the domain and used to authenticate the system device in the domain. The secure connection can be established by the management controller and the particular domain in some cases including the authentication of the particular domain for instance through the sharing of a domain certificate of the particular domain with the management controller. In some implementations a key exchange protocol can be included in the establishment of a secure communication channel such as a SIGMA key exchange protocol.

Turning to from the perspective of the particular domain such as at a domain manager of the particular domain a system device s attempt to access the particular domain can be identified prompting for instance a request to be sent to the system device to participate in a secured session with the particular domain. A one time password can be received for instance over a secure communication channel established between the particular domain and the system device the one time password derived by the system device from a seed of the particular domain provisioned on secure memory of the system device. The particular domain can authenticate the system device based on the one time password. Authentication can in some instances include the particular domain deconstructing the one time password to identify the underlying domain seed. In other instances the particular domain also derives the one time password from the seed known both to the particular domain and the system device and compares the one time password received by the system device with the one time password derived independently by the particular domain e.g. the domain manager among other examples.

Having authenticated a system device for participation in a secure session with the particular domain the particular domain can then continue to communicate with and perform transactions involving the hardware based management controller of the system device. Additionally based on the system device permitting the interface with the management controller the particular domain can apply e.g. particular policies such as a security or other policies to the system device during the session for instance based on an enhanced level of trust established through the secure session. In some instances security posture data or other data describing attributes of the system device can be received in the secure session or during authentication of the system device from the management controller and policies applied to the system device can be based on or tailored to account for the described attributes. The attributes communicated by the management controller can be considered to be more trustworthy than attribute data communicated by other non hardware based components of the system device more prone to manipulation spoofing etc.

In general subject matter of the present disclosure includes methods software computer executable instructions and systems capable of performing such tasks as identifying an opportunity for a computing device to participate in a secure session with a particular domain identifying using a secured microcontroller of the computing device a secured persistent seed corresponding to the particular domain and stored in secured memory of the computing device and deriving a secure identifier based on the seed. The secured identifier can be used to authenticate the computing device to the particular domain for the secure session.

In one example a system can be provided that includes a processor device a memory element and a domain manager. The domain manager can be adapted when executed by the processor device to identify an opportunity for a secure session between a particular domain and a client device the secure session based at least in part on identity verification of the client device. The domain manager can be further adapted to receive a secure identifier from the client device that was generated based on a seed of the particular domain provisioned on secure memory of the client device authenticate the client device based at least in part on the secure identifier and apply security policies for transactions involving the client device and the particular domain based at least in part on the authentication of the client device among other examples.

In some instances secured memory can inaccessible to resources of operating systems of the computing device. Additionally the seed can be unique within a system to a pairing of the computing device and particular domain. The seed can be received from the particular domain over a secured channel and the secured channel can be established based on authenticating the particular domain. Authentication of the particular domain can include for example using a key exchange protocol such as a SIGMA protocol. Additionally a user of the computing device can be prompted to grant permission to participate in the secure session with the particular domain.

The secure identifier such as a one time password can be derived based on the seed and a value known to both the computing device and particular domain. For instance the value can include an identifier of the particular domain e.g. received from the domain a system clock value or other value commonly known between the device and domain. Identifying the seed can include determining whether a seed corresponding to the particular domain is stored in the secured memory and determining that no seed exists for the particular domain can cause a request for a seed to be sent to the particular domain. The corresponding seed can then be received from the particular domain in response to the request. Further the seed when stored in secured memory of the computing device can survive attempts to wipe system memory. Further multiple different seeds corresponding to different domains can be stored in secure memory and respective secure identifiers can be generated from each seed each secure identifier having a value unique to that secure identifier. Additionally security posture data can be communicated over a secured channel between the computing device and domain the secure posture data describing attributes of the computing device.

In another general aspect subject matter of the present disclosure includes methods software computer executable instructions and systems capable of performing such tasks as identifying an opportunity for a secure session between a particular domain and a client device the secure session based at least in part on identity verification of the client device. A one time password can be received from the client device that was generated based on a seed of the particular domain provisioned on secure memory of the client device. The client device can be authenticated based at least in part on the one time password and security policies for transactions involving the client device and the particular domain can be applied based at least in part on the authentication of the client device.

In some instances the seed can be generated for the pairing of the particular domain and the client device where the seed is one of a several seeds generated for the particular domain each seed corresponding to a respective pairing of the particular domain and device. Indeed various devices can authenticate themselves to the domain based on their respective secure identifiers generated from their respective seed among other examples. Varying policies can be applied to the various devices as well. Further seeds can be communicated to the client device over a secured communication channel between the particular domain and the client device. Additionally a one time password can be processed to derive the seed and a corresponding profile can be identified that is mapped to the seed. Additionally the one time password can be authenticated based on system clock data included with the one time password. Secure encrypted communication channels can be established and used in communications between the particular domain and a client device such as between the particular domain and a secured microcontroller of the client device including the communication of the one time password. Additionally security posture data can be received from a client device over an established encrypted communication channel the security posture data describing attributes of the client device and stored in secured memory of the client device. Such security posture data can be associated with a profile associated with the seed and the security policies can be identified and applied based at least in part on the security posture data among other examples and combinations of the foregoing.

Thus particular embodiments of the subject matter have been described. Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. In some cases the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. In addition the processes depicted in the accompanying figures do not necessarily require the particular order shown or sequential order to achieve desirable results.
