This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 503 230 filed on Jun. 30 2011 entitled Locating a Lyric Phrase in a Digital Music Recording. 

The present invention relates generally to interaction with digital audio and more particularly to a method and system for communicating between a sender and a recipient via a personalized message including an audio clip associated with a desired lyric phrase extracted from a pre existing recording as well as the associated method and system for locating the portion of the audio file containing the desired lyric and creating a digital file from that segment.

Consumers are purchasing digital music and products to augment their digital music libraries at unprecedented rates. A combination of better music management and evolving digital rights management has created an environment where more music than ever is available legally and creative tools to use that music are easily accessible.

An emotion may be felt by one individual toward another or it can be shared between two or more individuals. For many reasons recordings may encapsulate many emotions. For example the recording of an opera may contain emotions of the various roles in the opera. Expressing an emotion by singing a song can be traced back at least to the troubadours of the High Middle Ages 1100 1350 . Song lyrics are crafted to describe a human emotion in a succinct and precise manner. The music encapsulating an emotive lyric shades and intensifies the description. The analog of the troubadour in the modern age is to communicate the emotion by sending a recording of the song encapsulating the emotion. However the market offerings for creating a snippet of song that represents a particular emotion or set of feelings are scarce. Existing services have categorized a limited number of audio files harvested from various public Internet sites. Often the harvested files do not include the entire original work. Frequently the harvested files were unlicensed copies themselves and many times the audio quality is poor. Thus there is a need for a service that can provide access to licensed audio that allows for the clipping of that audio into licensed clips so that users and providers associated with these transactions are not in violation of copyright laws. Involvement with an unlicensed system could damage the businesses reputation and that of any sponsors.

Existing services require that a user listen to the entire audio file or prior users previously created clips to determine a clip start and stop time for a portion of the song they wish to clip. There have long been means and methods for a human operator to examine a digital recording and to clip a pre specified lyric phrase out of the recording. There are for example recording studios that contain hardware devices for the editing of recorded music including listening to the music and clipping out certain segments of recordings. There are also software programs that enable the user to listen to digitally recorded music on a home computer and to clip out segments from digital media. Many of these options require access to specialized hardware and or software and may further require the user to possess the expertise to operate the hardware and or software to achieve the desired result. The few generally available options are cumbersome which makes creating the audio clips time consuming and difficult particularly for novice users.

There is a need in the art to provide users with a way to find the specific feeling they are looking to express from within the music. There is an associated need to provide selectable lyrics that may be preferably searchable. There is a further desire to provide potentially easier alternatives to quickly locate a desired portion of a song.

Accordingly there is a need for a system that would provide even novice users the functionality to identify a recording containing a desired lyric phrase get a clip of that lyric phrase and facilitate the transmission of that audio clip via email text IM or other means of electronic particularly one to one or peer to peer communication as opposed to one to many sites that allow users to post song segments that are meaningful to them.

Mobile phone use and music consumption and involvement show a concrete connection that has experienced rapid growth much along the lines of mobile messaging services. A 2010 Pew Research study indicated that 33 of mobile subscribers use their phone for music that number is 3 more than those who use instant messaging and 4 more than application use. Consumers will come to know and expect richer communication experiences from their smartphones. Thus there is an opportunity to leverage this mobile phone usage for musical playback and messaging.

Many e greeting services have already taken advantage of increasing mobile internet use. Industry experts predict that mobile greetings including unique services for youth dating and special interests will generate over 100 M in revenue between 2010 and 2013. However none of these e greeting services have filled the needs noted above.

The present disclosure teaches various inventions that address in part or in whole these and other various desires in the art. Those of ordinary skill in the art to which the inventions pertain having the present disclosure before them will also come to realize that the inventions disclosed herein may address needs not explicitly identified in the present application. Those skilled in the art may also recognize that the principles disclosed may be applied to a wide variety of techniques involving communications marketing reward systems and social networking.

First approaching the present invention at a high more consumer oriented level imagine that an end user a sender using their smartphone could select and then clip a line or two from their favorite pre existing song or other pre existing recording and send it electronically to a friend to let them know how the sender is feeling at that moment. These snippets of songs may typically last less than 19 seconds but may range from one second to 29 seconds and even longer and can be thought of as a musical emoticon . . . a way to send thoughts and feelings.

The audio snippet may be sent to a recipient s text chat or email conversation via mobile phone tablet device or computer. In one embodiment an end user receives a custom message which may be using a short code e.g. 547 20 telling them that their friend has sent them a message with an audio clip. In one approach a link is included in the message when the end user clicks on the link they are taken to a system landing page where they will see their friend s personalized message and play the audio clip. The recipient may then be provided with the option of sharing the audio clip with other friends purchasing the entire song or going to the system website to learn more about the artist. In IM Chat and email conversations users simply click on the link to arrive at the system landing page. The recipient of the audio clip may click on a link to be connected to a streaming server that takes the recipient to a landing page that displays a custom message sent by their friend and play the brief audio clip created by the friend.

In one approach an Application Programming Interface API may be used to integrate the inventive method and system with preexisting music catalog software e.g. iTunes Rhapsody Pandora . The API catalogs constructs and delivers a short portion of a song that is relevant to a consumer s electronic communication with a friend. The API offers a live data gathering approach to collect and sanitize current music offerings from a variety of catalogs and repositories.

In some approaches a central clearinghouse may be used to organize the sampling of each pre existing song to create an audio database for the system as well as the purchasing opportunities for a particular full version of the song. The system and method may also include analytics digital rights management and purchasing flows. Among other things streaming technology allows the system to fully account for each streamed snippet while minimizing if not removing the threat of piracy.

In a system intended to support this transmission of musical emoticons the pre existing recordings may be identified by any number of attributes including but not limited to the artist title musical genre speed lyrics as well as other variables which may be included for instance in metadata.

To this end the present disclosure teaches among other things a method of communicating between a sender and a recipient via a personalized message created by the sender on a communication device. The method comprises identifying text via a user interface on the communication device of a desired lyric phrase from within a pre existing recording extracting the audio substantially associated with the desired lyric phrase from the pre existing recording into a desired audio clip via a substantially automated process providing an electronic address for the recipient inputting personalized text via the user interface creating the personalized message with the sender identification the personalized text and access to the desired audio clip and sending an electronic message to the electronic address of the recipient. The sent electronic message may be an SMS EMS MMS IM or email message including a link to the personalized message or an EMS MMS or email message comprised of the personalized message itself. Creating the personalized message may further include saving the desired audio clip in a storage facility not controlled by either the sender or the recipient and providing a handle to the desired audio clip in the personalized message.

The method may further include creating an account for the sender associating the sender account with funds and deducting from the funds associated with the sender account upon the occurrence of a predetermined event. The predetermined event may be sending the electronic message the recipient accessing the handle of the audio snippet or even the successful receipt of the electronic message. The amount of funds credits deducted from the sender account may be based upon who the publisher owner controlling agent is of the pre existing recording.

Where sending the electronic message is controlled by an administrator and the pre existing recording is controlled by a publisher creating the personalized message may further include providing a link to a web page controlled by the publisher that offers the pre existing recording and associating the link with the administrator so that the publisher pays the administrator if the recipient purchases the pre existing recording from the web page.

Identifying text may require the sender to search for the desired lyric phrase within one or more pre existing recordings. The lyrics may be generated for use in the system using a speech to text conversion program on the pre existing recording. The method may include means to assist the sender in searching such as means for selecting an emotion from a list of possible emotions and displaying the one or more pre existing recordings pre associated with the selected emotion. The method may include other search aids such as playing back at least a portion of one or more pre existing recordings via the user interface. Where extracting the audio substantially associated with the desired lyric phrase was used to further create lyrics synchronized to the pre existing recording playing back the portion of one or more pre existing recordings may include displaying lyrics associated with the portion of the one or more pre existing recordings on the user interface.

The substantially automated process for extracting audio substantially associated with the desired lyric phrase from the pre existing recording into the desired audio clip may include applying the adjusted best suited wavelet template to the pre existing recording to form a time by frequency matrix detecting vocal non vocal edges in the time by frequency matrix establishing vocal intervals based on the detected edges mapping lyrics for the pre existing recording onto the established vocal intervals and extracting the desired audio clip by matching the desired lyric phrase to one of the established vocal intervals based on the mapping. This extraction method may further include analyzing the pre existing recording to select the best suited wavelet template for the pre existing recording and adjusting the parameters of the best suited wavelet template.

The invention may further include a system for communicating between a sender and a recipient via a personalized message created by the sender via a communication device. The system including a music database containing a plurality of pre existing recordings a sender user interface in operable communication with the communication device capable of displaying the plurality of pre existing recordings in the music database and lyrics associated with each of the plurality of pre existing recordings the sender user interface supporting a identification by the sender of a desired lyric phrase found within one of the plurality of pre existing recordings b entry of an electronic address of the recipient and c entry of a personalized text an audio extraction engine operably associated with the music database and the sender user interface to extract audio substantially associated with the desired lyric phrase found within one of the plurality of pre existing recordings into a desired audio clip and a message generator for generating the personalized message including the sender identification the personalized text and access to the desired audio clip and for saving the personalized message in a message database. The electronic message may be an SMS EMS MMS IM or email message including a link to the personalized message or an EMS MMS or email message comprised of the personalized message.

The audio extraction engine may use a time by frequency matrix to detect vocal non vocal edges and thus establish likely vocal intervals maps lyrics for the pre existing recording onto the established likely vocal intervals and then extracts the desired audio clip by matching the desired lyric phrase to one of the established vocal intervals based on the mapping.

The system may further include an asset management database containing a sender account for each sender each sender account being associated with funds. The asset management database may further contains accounts for one or more sponsors each sponsor account including a sponsor brand image and sponsor allocated funds wherein the funds associated each sender account are the sponsor allocated funds.

The system may also include an analytic engine for monitoring events generated by at least one of the sender user interface the message generator the recipient user interface. Among other things the analytic engine may determine whether a predetermined event has occurred which could be sending an electronic message to a recipient the successful receipt of the electronic message by the recipient or the recipient accessing the desired audio clip.

The sender user interface may support searching for the desired lyric phrase within the plurality of pre existing recordings in the music database. That search interface may support searching for the desired lyric phrase by providing an interface that facilitates the selection of an emotion from a list of possible emotions and then displays one or more pre existing recordings pre associated with the selected emotion.

These and other advantages and uses of the present system and associated methods will become clear to those of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing the present specification drawings and claims.

Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity so not all connections and options have been shown to avoid obscuring the inventive aspects. For example the dimensions and or relative positioning of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help improve the understanding of various embodiments of the present disclosure. Also common but well understood elements that are useful or necessary in a commercially feasible embodiment are not often depicted in order to facilitate a less obstructed view of these various embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be further appreciated that certain actions and or steps may be described or depicted in a particular order of occurrence while those skilled in the art will understand that such specificity with respect to sequence is not actually required. It will also be understood that the terms and expressions used herein are to be defined with respect to their corresponding respective areas of inquiry and study except where specific meaning have otherwise been set forth herein.

The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which show by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Among other things the present invention may be embodied as methods or devices. Accordingly the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense.

The present invention provides a system and method that can be utilized with a variety of different communication devices including but not limited to PDA s cellular phones smart phones laptops tablet computers and other mobile devices that include cellular voice and data service as well as preferable access to consumer downloadable applications. One such communication device could be an iPhone Motorola RAZR or DROID however the present invention is preferably platform and device independent. In fact ebook readers that provide web access e.g. the Kindle from Amazon.com and the Nook from Barnes Noble may also be used as the communication device . The communication device technology platform may be Microsoft Windows Mobile Microsoft Windows Phone 7 Palm OS RIM Blackberry OS Apple iOS Android OS Symbian Java Linux or any other technology platform. For purposes of this disclosure the present invention has been generally described in accordance with features and interfaces that are optimized for a smartphone utilizing a generalized platform although one skilled in the art would understand that all such features and interfaces may also be used and adapted for any other platform and or device.

The communication device further includes a user interface that provides some means for the consumer to receive information as well as to input information or otherwise respond to the received information. As is presently understood without intending to limit the present disclosure thereto this user interface may include a microphone an audio speaker a haptic interface a graphical display and a keypad keyboard pointing device and or touch screen. The communication device will also include a processor and memory. The memory may include ROM RAM as well as one or more removable memory cards. The memory provides storage for computer readable instructions and other data including a basic input output system BIOS and an operating system for controlling the operation of the communication device. The communication device will also include a device identification memory dedicated to identify the device such as a SIM card that uniquely identifies the device. Although the specification may focus on the communication device being a smartphone it should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art having the present specification drawings and claims before them that this is simply for ease of explanation and not intended to limit the present invention to any smartphone embodiment.

One envisioned mode of delivery is via communication devices that do not contain any system specific applications. In this delivery mode the system will be received managed and played using software indigenous to a stock mobile telephone. In most instances this approach would mean that the system would then be encoded as a standard compliant multimedia messaging service MMS message. However it is contemplated that native email programs available on many stock mobile telephones will be used in conjunction with the system. It is also contemplated that web based email programs could be used.

Even where the communication devices contain a system application that application will necessarily rely on much of the device s indigenous software to handle the system. For instance indigenous software will always be responsible for receiving the audio snippet from the server and for playing back the audio snippet through the mobile telephone s audio subsystem.

Furthermore standards compliant means in the mobile telephone will be used to encode and enforce the security policy associated with the system .

The communication device also preferably includes a mobile network interface to establish and manage wireless communications with the cellular telephone system . The cellular telephone system uses one or more communication protocols and technologies including but not limited to global system for mobile communication GSM 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA time division multiple access TDMA user datagram protocol UDP transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP general packet radio service GPRS WAP ultra wide band UWB IEEE 802.16 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMax SIP RTP or any of a variety of other wireless communication protocols to communicate with the mobile network of a mobile network operator. Accordingly the mobile network interface may include as a transceiver transceiving device or network interface card NIC .

To facilitate the use and bi directional transmission of data between the server and the communication devices the cellular telephone system is preferably operably connected to the Internet . In fact Internet may comprise the Internet WAN LAN Wi Fi or other computer network now known or invented in the future . It should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art having the present specification drawings and claims before them that the communication devices may be operably connected to the server over any combination of wired and wireless conduits including copper fiber optic microwaves and other forms of radio frequency electrical and or optical communication techniques. As will be discussed more fully herein below many of the communications conducted via system may be SMS short message service EMS enhanced message service MMS multimedia message service instant messaging email messaging and other types of messaging that are or may become available for use in association with communication devices .

As shown in server comprises messaging server SMS EMS MMS messaging system music database message database asset management database and analytic database . Although this illustration will serve to explain the aspects of the present invention well as might be expected there may be a substantial amount of overlap between subsystems and process elements such that functionality may be moved between subsystems and process elements reorganized while still maintaining the spirit of the present invention. An administrator may access the server via computer which computer may also comprise a communication device . As further illustrated in messaging server comprises the sender user interface the audio extraction engine the message generator the recipient user interface and analytic engine . As would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art having the present specification drawings and claims before them each of the sender user interface the audio extraction engine the message generator the recipient user interface and analytic engine may be implemented as software running on a variety of processor written in any of a variety of computer languages however these subsystems may also be fully or partially implemented in hardware or firmware using a variety of techniques that are well known in the art. also illustrates many of the significant connections between the databases and and the subsystems of the messaging server .

While the databases and are each depicted as a single database it should be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art having the present specification drawings and claims before them that the any and all of the databases and may be stored in multiple locations and across multiple pieces of hardware including but not limited to storage in the cloud i.e. a set of virtual storage areas and systems that expand and contract with use without requiring the manual provisioning or deprovisioning of physical hardware by the administrator . In view of the sensitivity and or commercial significance of most of the data stored in the databases they are preferably secured in an attempt to minimize the risk of undesired disclosure of viewer information to third parties. The databases may be standard relational database systems such as those available from Oracle which are widely used to organize media files.

As further illustrated in music database contains records . . . associated with a plurality of pre existing recordings or audiofiles . These records may be created by the subsystem process illustrated in to ingest pre existing recordings into the system . In particular one or more owners publishers of pre existing recordings such as Rhapsody Pandora and iTunes may send audio files in a variety of formats including but not limited to mp3 way m4a wma mpeg along with artist album and title information as well as metadata. Metadata is information about the media file and typically this information is particular to how the media database is to be used. For example metadata for the iTunes recorded music database would include the name of a song and the name of the performer since this information is what Apple s customers wish to use to access the database. Indexing is the way metadata is processed to find a particular entry in the database.

Because of the ability to provide publishers owners of pre existing recordings with income from even small portions of the recordings in their catalogs as well as the security provided for the pre existing recordings the system will leverage licensing deals with various catalogs of music to scan and index their libraries of pre existing recordings dynamically. To optimize revenue for the publishers owners partners of the system will take each music catalog that is scanned and indexed and assigned a preferred purchasing method for the full track song in music records . Some catalogs may have current deals with iTunes or Amazon while others may allow for independent payment acceptance. However the system is purchasing availability agnostic meaning that the optimum route to purchase for a particular full track song is dynamically assigned at the time of indexing and can change as many times as the music catalog holder desires. The system will ingest any incentive data that is offered by the music label. Special offers pre purchase deals and more will be added to the master library and passed on to the users. Purchases that utilize an incentive offer will be easily tracked using the system reporting systems as well as the unique offer ID that accompanies each sale event at participating purchase partners iTunes Amazon etc. .

As shown in the pre existing recordings are queued up and to the extent the publisher owner of the pre existing recording does not provide the text of the associated lyrics the pre existing recording may be fed to a speech to text conversion engine such as the commercial available speech to text engines sold by Nuance Communication so as to create a lyric file from the pre existing audio recording. The generated lyrics audio file data e.g. artist album title and metadata may be saved into music database in a unique record . It is contemplated that the lyrics could be generated on the fly when a person indicates potential interested in a particular pre existing recording so as to economize on the storage size of music database . However the potential real time performance problems or conversely the need for expensive processor power that could be created by dynamic lyric creation may make this approach less desirable.

As any audio files or snippet must be played back using hardware and software found in existing communications devices the encoding of the audio clips should comply with existing standards and formats. It is contemplated that the audio clips may be stored in the music database in a different format. For instance pre existing recordings within the music database may preferably be the sampled versions instead of recordings of the full track versions. This not only reduces space but greatly enhances the secure nature of the relational databases. It being contemplated that full track versions for sale are maintained within the purchase partner systems. Where the pre existing recordings are maintained in the database in a non compliance format the audio clip will be translated into the proper format when an audio clip is created for delivery. However it is similarly contemplated that audio clips may be saved in one or more of a variety of formats because backend storage is cheap and response time of the system is critical.

Database contains data related to asset management which may include among other data sender account information. The sender account information will include at least an electronic address for each sender associated with the system . The electronic address may comprise an email address an SMS short code an SMS long code or other means of reference one or more communication devices e.g. telephone number ESN IMEI and or MEID associated with a sender. Database may also contain data related to sponsorship of the system . For example a company may wish to ingratiate itself to customers or potential customers by subsidizing the use of the pre existing recordings. In such a case the sponsoring company may store its logo and other marketing material for use in association with the personalized messages it is financing. A sponsor funds account would also be established in database so that funds may be deducted from the account by the analytic engine upon the occurrence of a predetermined event such as

The analytic engine monitors events generated by at least one and preferably each of sender user interface audio extraction engine message generator and recipient user interface . A wide variety of behavior is tracked including when a personalized message was created what type of messaging format the creator and recipient were using how often that personalized message was viewed by those other than the original recipient vitality measure what licensee requested the message the dollar amount in full track purchases that a specific messages generated and any incentives that were applied.

The administrator manages the sender account databases and authentication methods removing the burden of maintaining personal consumer information from publishers and owners.

Among other potential data gathered by the analytic engine would also be the occurrence of predetermined events that result in charges to the account. By tracking one or more of the types of predetermined events discussed above the analytic engine will be able to gather data for storage in analytic database . The data in analytic database may be mined for a variety of purposes. These purposes may be expanded by requesting demographic data from each sender upon the establishment of the sender account within system . Furthermore the collection of the demographic data may provide the user with suggested snippets to send or targeted marketing based specifically on the unique set of demographic and environmental or technical information of the user at any given point in time. For example a sender s location zip code or geo location may be used to create a playlist that includes potentially preferred pre existing recordings e.g. country music for sender s located in Texas .

The system may also include digital rights management DRM for anti piracy e.g. digital watermarking and audio fingerprinting technologies playlist generation and audio thumbnail and albumming technologies. Although in most cases a digital right management strategy will not be necessary the ability to embed a particular DRM at the request of a label may be possible within the system. It is believed that DRM will not be necessary due to 1 the extremely short snippets of song that are created by the system expected generally to be under 19 seconds in length 2 the preferred approach to the system and methods of distributing only a handle or link to the song clip which is housed in a secure manner at the server and then streaming the audio upon actuation of the clip rather than downloading the file and 3 the ability of the system to monetize each playback of the linked song snippet for the publisher owner and or limit the number of times the pre existing recording may be played via the system.

Turning to the process begins when a sender launches the application via a communication device . The application may be web based pre loaded or otherwise downloaded onto the communication device as a thin or even thick client providing a conduit to the sender user interface associated with messaging server or it may be more robust providing more the user interface functionality locally in conjunction with sender user interface . The application may be an application programming interface API that associates the functionality discussed herein with another program such as an email program on phone messaging applications interactive video game platforms browser plug ins and more.

The sender may browse pre existing recordings looking for a lyric phrase that helps the sender express their current mood or emotions about the intended recipient of the personalized message or the subject contemplated for the personalized message. For instance the sender may be excited about a party they will be attending with the intended recipient of the personalized message so they have decided to write the recipient a personalized message to get them excited about the forthcoming events too. In another example illustrated in association with the sender may be worried about the intended recipient so they have decided to write the recipient a personalized message to convey that the recipient can always count on them to support and or cheer them up. In particular in the sender is browsing through pre existing recordings and available in music database that have been sorted in alphabetical order by the artists last names. As would be understood by pressing the Next link illustrated near the bottom of the touch screen of communication device another screen of pre existing recordings through would be displayed on the screen. depicts a slightly different embodiment where the sender is a sponsored sender and the music browsing screen features the logo and or branding of the sponsor in the illustrated example this has taken the form of the Cola Co logo. It should be understood that the location size and frequencies at which the logo and or branding of the sponsor may change depending upon the sponsor user behavior demographics and the sender s use of the system.

As illustrated browsing mode may provide the sender with album cover art work in addition to the title artist and album associated with each pre existing recording. In the embodiment illustrated in by pressing the play button or associated with any particular entry and respectively causes the pre existing recording to play. In the embodiment illustrated in by pressing the message button or associated with any particular entry and respectively causes the screen illustrated in showing the lyrics associated with the pre existing recording is launched. These lyrics will be downloaded from the music database through sender user interface preferably via Internet to the communication device . As illustrated in the sender may be provided with the alternative of selecting from among audio clips that were previously created from the pre existing recording instead of having to select from the lyrics. These prior clips may be ranked based on their volume of prior usage and or may be personalized based on the sender s prior interaction with the system. If a prior clip is selected a new means for accessing the desired audio clip must be created for the message which may take the form of a new handle created to the desired audio clip or the creation of a new instance of the audio clip for insertion into the message depending upon the approach implemented.

If the desired lyric phrase has been selected from the lyrics of the pre existing recording the Next button near the top right of would be selected in the illustrated interface which would prompt the extraction of the audio clip substantially associated with the desired lyric phrase to begin via a substantially automated process that will be discussed in association with later in the application. It is contemplated that the extracted audio clip and associated desired lyric phrase may be saved in central database such as database or to minimize the need to perform extractions which may be processor intensive particularly where the desired lyric phrase has been or is expected to be popular. In such instances where the extracted audio has been saved the inventor still think of this as having extracted the audio associated with a desired lyric phrase. In a preferred embodiment of the process a handle is created that points to the storage location of the desired audio clip such that the handle can be included in the personalized message rather than actually embedding the desired audio clip. This is desirable for a few reasons including but not limited to safer rights management and minimizing the size of personalized messages which may be stored and or transmitted.

Returning to after selecting the desired lyric phrase the sender creates the rest of the personalized message. One illustrative interface for this task is shown in . In no particular order the sender identification may be input manually or automatically populated by the sender user interface the electronic address of the recipient is input and a personalized text is input into text field . The recipient address may be retrieved from a local address book on the communication device by selecting button and operating the address book in a well known manner. The sender may input personalized text into text field using an onscreen keyboard which has not been depicted in so as not to obscure the option of displaying the desired lyric phrase in a convenient location to the text field so the sender may coordinate the personalized text with the desired lyric phrase . As depicted in the interface may provide the sender with the number of characters remaining within the message format . It is contemplated that the personalized text may have no characters.

Rather than send a text based message after selecting the desired lyric phrase the sender could create an audio message that may be delivered by playing back a recording that is comprised of both the extracted audio but also audio recorded by sender for inclusion as a personal message. In such an embodiment the sender would input the electronic address of the recipient as a telephone number and then speak a personalized text which may be converted to text by a speech to text engine. It would be similarly possible for the user to type the desired text of the personalized message for it to be converted to audio via a text to speech program. In any approach the extracted audio and the personalized audio are recorded together and then distributed.

Turning to message generator within messaging server creates the personalized message including sender identification the personalized text access to the desired audio clip and where the sender is a sponsored sender the logo or other marketing materials that the sponsor wanted included with the personalized message. It should be understood that any particular sponsor may choose not to include any logo or other marketing materials in the personalized message but rather rely upon sponsorship branding in other aspects of the user interface such as the audio browsing screens as illustrated above in association with . The message generator then generates and sends an electronic message to the electronic address of the recipient via either SMS EMS MMS messaging system and cellular phone system or Internet depending on the type of electronic address provided by sender . The electronic message may be an SMS EMS MMS message instant message or email message including a link to the personalized message or an EMS MMS or email message including the personalized message. and best illustrate many of the differences between these potential types of electronic message. illustrates the receipt by the recipient on a smartphone of an electronic message that includes a link to the personalized message created by the sender. In this exemplary illustration of the text with embedded link are automatically created and sent by the server in the form of a text e.g. SMS EMS MMS message. illustrates the receipt by the recipient on a smartphone of an electronic message including a link to the personalized message created by the sender. In this exemplary illustration of the text with embedded link were automatically created and sent by server in the form of an email message. Finally illustrates the receipt by the recipient on a smartphone of an electronic message automatically created and sent by server in the form of an email message comprised of the actual personalized message created by the sender.

Returning to when the recipient clicks on link in the manner controlled by the operating system associated with the communication device a browser is launched and directed to open the webpage at the address of the link. The result of that process on the recipient s communication device in the illustrative example is depicted in . By pressing the play button in audio bar the recipient accesses the desired audio clip included by the sender in the personalized message and the audio begins to play via the speaker associated with communication device . While the default is for the audio clip to be displayed after the personalized text the audio bar may be positioned by the sender anywhere in the text when creating the message.

In the most preferred embodiment the desired audio clip has been maintained by the centralized host e.g. server such that clicking on the play button causes the contents of the file to be streamed to the recipient s communication device in substantially real time and played via the audio system of that communication device .

As illustrated in a progress indicator in audio bar may show timing information associated with the current playback of the audio snippet. A pause button is also illustrated and would have the functionality widely understood by end users. As further depicted in the recipient is provided with a button that would download the client portion of the application onto their communication device allowing them to create a sender account and send personalized messages via the system . Other buttons may also be provided so the recipient can share a description of the personalized message on a first social network such as Facebook button or on a second social network such as by Tweeting about the personalized message via button . In both instance the system may also allow the personalized text and textual information associated with the desired audio clip to be posted on either or both of first and second social networks.

Every personalized message is tracked and recorded in the analytics database along with several parameters such as the licensee that initiated creation device type of each play etc. The personalized messages may be designed to be circulated and replayed via channels like social networks. While the ability of the personalized messages to travel through various networks to be experienced by many is valuable the present system is mainly focused on the ability to provide a new form of peer to peer communication that provides a marketing opportunity for sponsors.

It is also contemplated where the sender wants privacy for the message the buttons may be disabled by selecting options before sending the personalized message. The final button that may be provided by the recipient user interface is a shopping cart button which would take the recipient to a webpage hosted by the publisher such as Rhapsody Pandora or iTunes associated with complete recording from which the audio snippet was taken to provide the recipient an easy opportunity to purchase the whole pre existing recording. The button would have an association to the administrator of the system so that the administrator can monetize the recipient s acquisition of the pre existing recording. In other words if the recipient buys a song from iTunes because they received it in a personalized message created by the system iTunes may compensate the owner of the system for the referral. Various types of mechanisms for crediting referring sites for click throughs such as cookies are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

If the music database used within the system is to be small and slowly growing for example 100 s of clips with 10 new clips being added every day then it is technically and economically practical that each clip be hand crafted. If on the other hand the music database is to be large and rapidly growing for example 10 000 s of clips with 1 000 new clips being added every day then some automatic or semi automatic method of creating clips must be defined. This is particularly the case if it is expected to be able to handle on request and in real time the creation of a system that isn t already in the catalog. The audio extraction engine automates this operation.

Returning now to the audio extraction engine is operably associated with the music database and the sender user interface to extract audio substantially associated with the desired lyric phrase see found within one of the plurality of pre existing recordings see into a desired audio clip. The music database provides two inputs into the audio extraction engine the pre existing digital recording which may be in any one of a variety of digital formats such as MP3 WAV MPEG 4 containing the desired lyric phrase and the song lyrics sung in the pre existing digital recording. The sender user interface provides the desired lyric phrase. Using these pieces of data the audio extraction engine extracts the audio substantially associated with the desired lyric phrase from the pre existing recording making it into a desired audio clip.

For example suppose the pre existing recording is the song Bring It On Home To Me as sung and recorded by Sam Cooke. is a pictogram of the time domain audio signal of a pre existing recording of this pre existing recording. The song lyrics sung in this pre existing recording are given in Table 1 below where the desired lyric phrase You know I ll always be your slave selected by the sender using sender user interface has been highlighted in bold face letters.

In one approach to audio extraction the process system can be thought to generally comprise two phases first an algorithm for finding segments vocal intervals in the pre existing recording that contain singing and second an algorithm for mapping or fitting the song lyrics onto the vocal intervals identified by the first phase. The audio extraction engine may iterate back and forth between the Phase I and Phase II algorithms until a satisfactory fitting of the lyrics to the vocal intervals has been realized. Once this is achieved the vocal interval containing the desired lyric phrase may be located from within the vocal intervals. is an illustration of the flow between the various steps and processes undertaking by the audio extraction engine . The two phases are described in more detail below.

There are identified in the art basic wavelets also called wavelet templates or mother wavelets that are well suited for analyzing popular music. In Step 1 an initial scan of the digitized signal in the pre existing recording that does not take into account the lyrics may be performed to determine which of these basic wavelets is most appropriate for the particular pre existing recording at hand.

As the number of basic wavelets well suited for analyzing popular music is small on the order of 10 one way of accomplishing the selection of the analysis wavelet is to apply each of the basic wavelets with their associated default popular music parameterization as given in the literature to the pre existing recording and to pick the basic wavelet that yields the best result.

In our running example we will use the Blackman wavelet without any intention that the invention be limited to the use of the Blackman wavelet the basic form of which is 

The mathematical specification of a basic wavelet includes parameters free variables that must be given values in order to apply it to the music signal. In our running Blackman wavelet example there is only one parameter . In Step 1 above the parameters were given default values. In Step 2 the parameters of the selected basic wavelet currently being used for vocal interval identification may be modified. If this is the first time Step 2 has been executed then the parameters of the basic wavelet may be adjusted to new values based on fundamental characteristics of the digital audio signal in the pre existing recording. If this is not the first time Step 2 is being executed e.g. Step 2 is being executed again after the execution of Steps 3 through Step 8 then the current parameter values are adjusted to new parameter values based on the details of the lack of fit of the lyrics to the vocal intervals computed in Step 8 below. The exact nature of this adjustment depends on the particular basic wavelet having been selected in Step 1 and currently being used to define the vocal intervals.

The fully parameterized wavelet determined in Step 2 is applied to the digitized signal in the pre existing recording. The result is an m by n time by frequency matrix of numbers where each number represents the amount of energy present in the song at a particular frequency at a particular time. An entry X at position m n in this matrix would for example mean that at mmilliseconds from the beginning of the song the amount of energy at frequency nwas X. X is typically a unitless numerical value indicating for example the ratio of the amount of energy present at frequency nat time mand the maximum energy at any frequency at time m.

We shall call the boundary or transition time moment between a time interval during which there is singing and a time interval during which there is no singing an edge. That is an edge is a moment in time on one side of which there is singing and on the other side of which there is no singing.

The wavelet parameters have been adjusted in Step 2 so that when the resulting fully parameterized wavelet is applied to the digital signal in Step 3 the time intervals during which there is singing are maximally differentiated from time intervals in which there is no singing.

In Step 4 then the edges in the time by frequency matrix produced in Step 3 are identified and sharpened using edge detection algorithms known in the current art. These algorithms include but are not limited to 

The edges identified by Step 4 will not be of equal clarity or definiteness. Some will be very distinct and obviously be boundaries between singing and non singing. Others will be less distinct and could for example simply indicate that singing has gone from a high pitch to a low pitch from a solo to a chorus or from pianissimo to fortissimo. In Step 5 a numerical value is assigned to the definiteness or strength of each edge produced by Step 4. A high value on this measure indicates that it is highly likely that this edge is a singing non singing transition while a low value means the edge is less likely to be a singing non singing transition.

Using the edge strengths produced in Step 5 the method next identifies edges which will be asserted to be the start of singing and edges that will be taken to be the stop of singing. For a start edge there is no singing before the edge and singing after the edge. For a stop edge there is signing before the edge and no singing after the edge. Start and stop edges must alternate. The time interval between a start edge and a stop edge shall be referred to as a vocal interval. The length of time between the start edge and the stop edge is the duration of the vocal interval.

In Step 7 words in the song lyrics are assigned to the vocal intervals created by Step 6 such that the last lyric word placed in one vocal interval is the lyric word immediately before the first lyric word in the following vocal interval. Each lyric word is mapped to exactly one vocal interval.

By way of a pedagogical example suppose there are 100 words w w . . . w in the song lyric and suppose 10 vocal intervals I I I have been created by Step 6. Associating the first 10 lyric words w w . . . w with the first vocal interval I the second ten lyric words w w . . . w with the second vocal interval I and so forth would be a mapping however na ve of the song lyrics to the vocal intervals.

In performing this mapping one takes into account the phrase structure of the song lyric. Thus using the above example one would try to map the entire lyric phrase You know I ll always be your slave to a single vocal interval such that these lyric words would be the only words assigned to this vocal interval.

In Step 8 an assessment is made as to how well Step 7 has mapped the song lyrics to the vocal intervals. Particular attention is paid to the fit of the interval containing the desired lyric phrase 3 . If the overall fit as computed in Step 8 is satisfactory if the fit of the desired lyric phrase is excellent and if the start edge and the stop edge of the vocal interval containing the target lyric phrase are strong as measured in Step 5 then proceed to Step 9. If the fit is not satisfactory or if the vocal interval to which the target lyric phrase has been assigned is not well defined then go back to Step 2 or Step 6 or Step 7.

In the case that Step 8 determines that the overall fit of the vocal intervals to the song lyric is satisfactory and that the edges of the vocal interval containing the target lyric phrase are sufficiently strong then the audio engine would extract the vocal interval containing the desired lyric phrase from pre existing recording. This synchronization between the audio and the lyrics may be maintained for future use by the system which could among other things support the sender s replay of synchronized audio with the selection of particular lyrics.

Although it is generally believed that the processes and apparatus used for audio extraction will perform appropriately in one embodiment of the invention the location of the identified segment digital recording within the digital recording may be displayed to a human operator for review editing adjustment and refinement before the final version of the desired audio clip is finally created. Similar processes may be provided for later manual revision of a desired audio clip that was snipped or otherwise extracted differently from the desired lyric phrase.

There are a number of assumptions regarding the nature of popular music and the selection of lyric phrases there from that can yield optimizations in the above canonical algorithm. For instance the system may base optimizations on song defined lyrical phrases. Referring back to Table 1 Lyrics of Bring It On Home To Me as sung by Sam Cooke above it can be assumed that a desired lyric phrase is coterminous with a lyric phase in the song lyrics. For example it is more likely that a desired lyric phrase is a phrase of the song lyrics such as You know I ll always be your slave rather than a subsequence of lyric that does not adhere to song lyric phrasing such as a desired lyric phrase as your slave Till I m dead that consists of the end of one song lyric phrase and the beginning of the next song lyric phrase.
