In wireless communications control channels are used to facilitate the transmission of system control information that is required in its operation. The amount of control information becomes considerably large in a broadband communication system which is typically used to provide multimedia services. For example system control information required in a broadband system may include signal acquisition mechanisms for mobile stations radio resource allocation for DL and UL transmission control instructions feedback of system parameters and acknowledgements and information for other system functionalities. In order to efficiently and effectively transmit such large amounts of control information certain methods and apparatus are needed to organize the information and to determine when and how the information is transmitted.

In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention a communication system includes a mobile station and a base station. A first uplink signal is transmitted by the mobile station to the base station on a first set of subcarriers in a first Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM symbol. The first set of subcarriers may be modulated with a first signal sequence the first signal sequence being known to both the mobile station and the base station. A second uplink signal may be transmitted by the mobile station to the base station on a second set of subcarriers in a second OFDM symbol. The second set of subcarriers may be modulated with the first signal sequence or a transform of the first signal sequence. The second set of subcarriers may further be modulated with a second signal sequence the second signal sequence containing attribute information on a third set of subcarriers of a downlink signal received by the mobile station over a downlink channel. The correspondence between the subcarriers in the third set and the subcarriers in the second set may be known to both the mobile station and the base station.

Words using the singular or plural number in this Detailed Description section also include the plural or singular number respectively. Additionally the words herein above below and words of similar import when used in this application shall refer to this application as a whole and not to any particular portions of this application. When the claims use the word or in reference to a list of two or more items that word covers all of the following interpretations of the word any of the items in the list all of the items in the list and any combination of the items in the list.

Referring to in a cellular wireless network the geographical region to be serviced by the network is normally divided into smaller areas called cells . In each cell coverage is provided by a base station BS . Thus this type of structure is normally referred to as the cellular structure as shown in . Within each coverage area there are located mobile stations MS s to be used as an interface between the users and the network. BS is connected to the backbone of the network usually by a dedicated link. Base station also serves as a focal point to distribute information to and collect information from its mobile stations by radio signals. A cell can also be divided into sectors . From system engineering point of view each sector can be considered as a cell. In this context the terms cell and sector are interchangeable.

The basic structure of a multi carrier signal in the frequency domain is made up of subcarriers. The subcarriers can be arranged in a particular manner into groups to support scalability and multiple access. The subcarriers forming one group are not necessarily adjacent to each other. The operation bandwidth of a system may vary. A variable bandwidth VB system is realized by adjusting the number of usable subcarriers in accordance with the given bandwidth. To facilitate operation of the user terminals in a VB environment specific signaling and control methods are required. Radio control and operation signaling is realized through the use of a core band CB . A core band substantially centered at the operating center frequency is defined as a frequency segment that is not greater than the smallest operating channel bandwidth among all the possible spectral bands that the receiver is designed to operate with.

The basic unit of a multi carrier signal in the time domain is generally an OFDM symbol. The OFDM time domain waveform is generated by applying the inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT to the OFDM signals in the frequency domain. A copy of the last portion of the time waveform known as the cyclic prefix CP is inserted in the beginning of the waveform itself to form the OFDM symbol. The length of the CP in the OFDM symbols can be varied to meet the requirements of different applications such as various cell sizes or configurations.

In accordance with the principles of the present invention signal transmission may be carried out using the hierarchical frame structure shown in . The top level transmission unit may be a superframe which may further consist of multiple frames . Each frame in turn may consist of multiple subframes . The subframe may consist of a plurality of time slots TS s and a special period SP . Each TS may comprise multiple OFDM symbols and a small guard period . TS can be allocated for the use of either downlink DL transmission including unicast multicast and broadcast or uplink UL transmission. For example in an arrangement shown in where L 6 two TS s are allocated for UL two are allocated for DL unicast and three are allocated for DL broadcast within a subframe. Alternatively in another arrangement two TS s are allocated for UL three are allocated for DL unicast and two are allocated for DL broadcast within a subframe. Furthermore a BS may use the former TS arrangement and another BS may use the latter TS arrangement as long as they are synchronized in time frame. The DL broadcast TS s can be further grouped into video bursts each of which carries an application data stream or a video stream.

SP which is usually placed in the transition from DL transmission to UL transmission may consist of a special downlink period SDP a downlink to uplink guard period DUGP and a special uplink period SUP . Alternatively SDP may be inserted in between the last UL TS and the following DL TS as shown in .

For the specific example given in Table 1 a superframe which consists of 10 frames has the duration of 100 ms. Each 10 ms frame in turn consists of two 5 ms subframes and a subframe consists of 7 TS s and an SP. Each TS has the duration of 675 ps and is comprised of multiple OFDM symbols.

In accordance with the principles of the present invention a hierarchical control structure HCS may be used in a cellular wireless communication system wherein the system control information may be grouped into different hierarchies and types such that the control information is transmitted between a BS to its MS s in a spectral efficient manner. The control information may include signal acquisition mechanisms for mobile stations radio resource allocation for DL and UL transmission and information and mechanisms to facilitate other system functionalities.

In accordance with aspects of embodiments of the present invention the DL control information may be classified into three hierarchies based on their functionality preambles superframe control headers SFCH s and DL common control channels D CCCH s whereas the UL control channels may include ranging channels RCH s and feedback channels FBCH s .

In accordance with aspects of embodiments of the present invention each hierarchy of control information may be further grouped into different types based on certain criteria. For example parameters that vary relatively slowly can be grouped together to be transmitted relatively infrequently whereas parameters that change relatively quickly can be grouped together to be transmitted relatively frequently. In addition the incremental changes or differences with respect to some control parameters are grouped together and transmitted relatively frequently.

Preambles are transmitted during a SDP with a predetermined fixed length of cyclic prefix. Preambles are designed to

In accordance with embodiments of this invention multiple types of preambles may be transmitted periodically by a BS. A type of preamble can differ from other types in terms of the information it carries the way it carries the information its functionality the way it is transmitted and other characteristics. For example a type of preamble may carry some essential system information such as the length of the cyclic prefix of the OFDM symbols in various time slots operation bandwidth and decoding information for SFCH. Another type of preamble may carry some essential system information for a BS to identify itself or for MS s to synchronize with the network.

In an embodiment a type of preamble may be designed to carry essential system information common to a group of cells and a part or the entirety of this type of preamble can be transmitted by such a group of BS s using the same subcarriers including data and pilot subcarriers at essentially the same time wherein macro diversity can be achieved at the MS to decode the corresponding part or the entirety of that preamble. Such a scenario is shown in where BS s transmit cell common information to MS . The cell common system information carried in this type of preamble may include

In another embodiment a type of preamble may be designed to facilitate cell specific operation functions and this type of preamble may be transmitted by an individual BS using a code sequence in either the time domain or the frequency domain which uniquely identifies that BS. The sequence can remain fixed from one subframe to the next or can vary from one subframe to the next in accordance with a particular pattern. The information embedded in this type of preamble may include

In yet another embodiment a type of preamble may only occupy the core bandwidth whereas another type of preamble can be designed to either occupy the core bandwidth or the entire channel bandwidth. For example the use of preambles defined within the core bandwidth simplifies the complexity in the implementation of initial signal acquisition in that only the signal within the core bandwidth is processed. The use of preambles defined in the entire operation bandwidth enables the MS s to measure inter cell interference conditions and report to their BS s. Based on the inter cell interference conditions a BS may adjust the pilot structure transmission power antenna configuration modulation and coding scheme subchannel assignment and operation parameters to optimize the performance capacity.

In still another embodiment channel coding may be applied to a type of preamble over multiple subframes or frames. For example repetition coding can be used to allow a certain type of combination process over time in decoding at the MS to improve the reception performance.

In an example shown in two types of preambles are defined Type I and Type II. The Type I preamble is defined within the core bandwidth. The subcarriers in the Type I preamble are further grouped into two sets Set and Set . The subcarriers in Set are modulated by a cell specific sequence and the subcarriers in Set carry cell common information. The Type II preamble is defined over the full bandwidth. The characteristics of the two types are given in Table 2.

The SFCH s can be transmitted in any DL TS. The assignment information of SFCH s such as their locations sizes and or modulation coding schemes may be specified in the preambles. Alternatively such assignment may be predetermined in the system specifications. For example the SFCH s in each superframe can be pre assigned to Subchannel in the TS in Subframe in Frame .

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention multiple types of SFCH s may be transmitted periodically by a BS. A type of SFCH differs from another in terms of the information it carries its functionality the way it is transmitted and other characteristics. For example a type of SFCH may carry some essential system information such as video broadcast configuration BS antenna configuration the CP lengths of TS s and D CCCH decoding information whereas another type of SFCH may carry some essential system information such as superframe number index and UL DL configuration. In addition a type of SFCH may also carry an optional or reserved field to provide the flexibility to add temporally required information.

In an embodiment a type of SFCH may be designed to carry some essential system information common to a group of cells and a part or the entirety of this type of SFCH can be transmitted by such a group of BS s using the same subcarriers including data and pilot subcarriers at essentially the same time wherein macro diversity can be achieved at the MS to decode the corresponding part or the entirety of that particular SFCH. Such a scenario is shown in where BS s transmit cell common information to MS . The cell common system information carried in this type of SFCH may include

In another embodiment a type of SFCH may be designed to carry some essential system information unique to an individual cell and this type of preamble may be transmitted by an individual BS using cell specific physical resources and means such as time frequency coding and scrambling. The cell specific system control information carried in this type of SFCH may include

In yet another embodiment a SFCH can be designed to either occupy the core bandwidth or the entire channel bandwidth.

In still another embodiment channel coding may be applied to a type of SFCH over multiple superframes. For example repetition coding can be used to allow a certain type of combination process over time in decoding at the MS to improve the reception performance.

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention a serving BS may transmit to its MS s a part or the entirety of a type of SFCH associated with a neighboring cell wherein information in this type of SFCH may be exchanged between BS s through the backbone network connecting them. These embodiments can be used to facilitate the fast acquisition of system control information from neighboring cells during the handoff thereby accelerating the handoff process. The information to be exchanged may include

In an embodiment such transmission may be carried out periodically or by the request of an MS that is served by this BS. In another embodiment the time and frequency resource for the transmission may be assigned by a type of SFCH transmitted by the serving BS.

The D CCCH s in a TS may carry detailed control information instructions for resource allocation and other directives for the current TS as well as the subsequent multiple TS s. The D CCCH s can be transmitted in any DL TS including any data or video TS . In a special case the SFCH s and D CCCH s may be transmitted all within a particular DL TS say TS . A typical D CCCH may include the following entries

An entry is a set of specific instructions and information with an appropriate type of message header and or tail. For example in the DL resource assignment entry the MCS resource and HARQ instruction for a DL transmission that is associated with a particular MS are provided 

A D CCCH may also carry assignment information e.g. by means of tail bit indicator to identify an additional D CCCH allocated within the current TS or allocated in a subsequent TS wherein the additional D CCCH contains supplementary control information. Alternatively a D CCCH can be specified through the TS control header TSCH which may provide additional flexibility in some systems. The location size and or modulation coding scheme of the TSCH are specified in a SFCH.

In accordance with aspects of embodiments of this invention multiple types of D CCCH s may be transmitted periodically by a BS. A type of D CCCH differs from another in terms of the information it carries the way it is transmitted and other characteristics.

In an embodiment a type of D CCCH may be designed to carry detailed control information that is unique to an individual MS and this type of D CCCH can be transmitted using selective unicast methods. For example a narrow antenna beam can be formed on the D CCCH dedicated to the MS as shown in .

In another embodiment a type of D CCCH may be designed to carry detailed control information to a particular group of MS s that possess certain characteristics in common. For example MS s can be grouped together if

This type of D CCCH can be transmitted using multicast methods such as multiple beams orthogonal or otherwise or directive beams in azimuth and or elevation. For example the D CCCH for a group of MS s located in proximity can be transmitted using a directive beam as shown in . The members in the group can change from one time to another depending on their commonality. The beamwidth or beam shape of the beam covering the group may also vary from one time to another depending on the locations of the MS s in the group.

In yet another embodiment a type of D CCCH may be designed to carry detailed assignment information relevant to all the MS s within a cell and this type of D CCCH is transmitted using broadcast or multicast methods within a cell. For example a fixed sector beam is used to broadcast the D CCCH to all the MS s within the sector as shown in .

In still another embodiment a type of D CCCH may be designed to carry some system information common to a group of cells and a part or the entirety of this type of D CCCH can be transmitted by such a group of BS s using the same subcarriers including data and pilot subcarriers at essentially the same time wherein macro diversity can be achieved at the MS to decode the corresponding part or the entirety of that particular D CCCH. Such a scenario is shown in where BS s transmit cell common information to MS . The cell common system information carried in this type of D CCCH may include scheduling information for video bursts which consists of the control and decoding information for various video streams.

A D CCCH may be transmitted using variable modulation and coding schemes MCS s and its location size and or MCS may be directly specified in a SFCH. A constant MCS can be used to transmit a type of D CCCH where the particular MCS to be used may be predetermined based on system deployment conditions. Alternatively a semi static MCS can be used to transmit a type of D CCCH where the decision on the particular MCS to be used is based on the long term coverage statistics reported by the MS s and the MCS is specified in a type of SFCH. Furthermore AMC can be applied to transmit a type of D CCCH where MS s are partitioned into groups according to their DL AMC schemes and the D CCCH entries for the each group are coded together using the same AMC scheme and protected by a CRC or checksum.

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention specific parameters such as the TS index and the group ID may be included in a type of D CCCH to facilitate a certain transmission process. The TS index is referred to as the number identifying one of the TS s in a subframe frame or superframe. The group identification Group ID is defined as the number identifying one of the groups to which multiple MS s of a certain commonality belong.

In an embodiment a type of D CCCH may carry the control information for the current TS as well as the control information for the subsequent multiple DL TS s. The control information for a particular TS or for the subsequent TS s can be placed within an information field that is associated with the TS index. For example in specifying the control information for a set of TS s an entry of the D CCCH may be arranged as

In a more general case the control information for multiple contiguous TS s can be specified in a single entry. For example in specifying the control information multiple TS s reference point e.g. starting or ending TS index is given in the D CCCH entry which may be arranged as

The TS index in a D CCCH can be a modular number of L. For example in the case of L 6 the TS index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 . . . If the TS index of the current TS i.e. where the D CCCH is is n the immediately following TS indices n 1 n 2 . . . L correspond to the TS s in the current subframe the next set of modular numbers 0 1 . . . L correspond to the TS s in the next subframe and so on as depicted in . Alternatively The TS index in a D CCCH can be a relative number. For example the current TS is indexed to be 0 or any default number and the indices for the subsequent TS s increment by one. The TS index is reset by the next D CCCH.

In another embodiment a type of D CCCH may carry the control information for one or more groups. The control information for a particular group can be placed within an information field that is associated with the Group ID. For example a part of the structure of the D CCCH may be arranged as

Each information field associated with a particular group may be encoded individually with some coding and modulation scheme. Furthermore each group information field can be protected by an error detection coding scheme e.g. CRC or checksum or the entire D CCCH can be protected by an error detection coding scheme.

In accordance with aspects of the embodiments of this invention an MS may extract the operation parameters and system information from the preambles SFCH s and D CCCH s.

In an embodiment an MS may extract system parameters and control information by directly decoding the preambles SFCH s and D CCCH s in an orderly manner.

In another embodiment an MS may optimize the estimation of synchronization timing for unicast and broadcast differently. In unicast transmission and reception an MS determines the synchronization timing based on the cell specific preamble transmitted by its serving BS. In reception of broadcast video an MS determines the synchronization timing based on the cell specific preamble and or cell common preambles taking into consideration of the different delays in transmission from BS s other than the serving BS. For example the MS can take the average weighted or otherwise of different delays in determining its synchronization timing.

In yet another embodiment the MS may determine some operation parameters such as operation bandwidth BS transmission mode e.g. multiple input multiple output mode and DL UL configuration via ways of signal processing and detection without explicit control information. For example the operation bandwidth can be determined based on the energy profile of the preambles in the frequency domain the BS transmission mode can be determined on the pilot structure and or pilot energy if a transmission mode is uniquely associated with a particular pilot structure and or pilot energy or the DL UL configuration can be determined by finding the UL DL switching point which can be achieved based on the difference between the energy profiles in the time and or frequency domains of the OFDM symbols in UL and DL TS s.

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention multiple types of RCH s can be transmitted by an MS. A type of RCH differs from another in terms of their functionalities. For example a type of RCH can be used for

A signal sequence via an RCH can be a code sequence in either the time or frequency domain and consists of a set of subcarriers that are distributed over a part of or the entire operation bandwidth. The signal sequence may be known to both the mobile station and the serving base station An MS transmits an RCH signal to its serving BS by self initiation when necessary or by the request of its serving BS e.g. polling . Either binary or non binary sequences can be used to modulate with the subcarriers in an RCH. Open loop or closed loop power control can also be applied to a type of RCH including the channel sound RCH.

In an embodiment the RCH s may be normally transmitted during a SUP or can also be inserted in an UL TS. The transmission of the multiple types of RCH s may be multiplexed

In an embodiment the subcarriers in the signal sequence for channel sounding which may be less than the total usable subcarriers within the entire bandwidth may be distributed uniformly or otherwise across a part of or the entire bandwidth. For example in a channel sounding RCH every nsubcarrier is used to form the signal sequence in an interleaving fashion shown in . As a result n non overlapping signal sequences can be generated for channel sounding. The subcarrier spacing for channel sounding is preferably less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. The amplitudes of the subcarriers in an RCH are not necessarily equal.

In one embodiment the subcarriers in an RCH may be equal in energy. In another embodiment the subcarriers in an RCH may be different in energy.

In another embodiment an MS can deliver the attribute information on the interference from neighboring BS s to its serving BS via a channel sounding RCH. This enables the serving BS to assess the level of the signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR at that MS and to assign the appropriate subchannels to that MS according to some criteria. An MS is able to estimate the channel response from a neighboring BS based on a particular signal e.g. a type of preamble or pilots sent out by this neighboring BS. Such a channel response is actually the interference experienced by that MS. As shown in an MS is subject to the interference from the interfering BS s . By processing the signals from the neighboring cells the MS is able to generate an overall interference noise profile.

Let by I f denote the attribute information as a function of frequency within the channel bandwidth. To deliver the attribute information to the serving BS the MS embeds a function of I f e.g. by modulating a signal sequence carrying the attribute information I f in the channel sounding signal or in a transform e.g. a conjugation or absolute value of the channel sounding signal. For example the amplitude of the nsubcarrier a f in the channel sounding sequence can be proportional to the inverse of I f that is

In the case where multiple antennas are used at the BS the serving BS calculates the overall SINR with multiple antenna transmission based on some algorithm e.g. maximum ratio combining or equal gain combining selects the subchannel with certain overall SINR values by some criteria and assigns them to the MS for data transmission.

The FBCH s provide time and frequency resources for one or more MS s to send an acknowledgement ACK signal to confirm the success or failure of a particular DL transmission or to report the channel quality indication CQI with respect to a particular DL subchannel. In terms of resource an FBCH consists of multiple subcarriers over one or more OFDM symbols which are referred to as the FBCH resource region. For example in is shown a typical resource region of an FBCH where there are 16 subcarriers over a TS 8 OFDM symbols . The subcarriers in an FBCH are not necessarily contiguous. A FBCH may consist of subcarriers distributed over the operation bandwidth or of multiple segments distributed over the operation bandwidth where each segment consists of a plurality of contiguous subcarriers. Pilot subcarriers can be inserted within or outside of the FBCH resource region in a time division multiplexing frequency division multiplexing or code division multiplexing manner.

An FBCH resource region in a UL TS is specified with certain definitions e.g. its beginning time frequency coordinates or the beginning coordinate with length in a particular entry in a D CCCH.

An FBCH may have a one to one correspondence to a DL TS that is the FBCH is used to report feedbacks associated with that DL TS. An FBCH may also correspond to multiple DL TS s which is usually the case in a TDD system where there are normally more DL TS s than UL TS s. In one embodiment one or more FBCH resource regions can be defined in a particular UL TS each of which is specified via a D CCCH in a DL TS. In another embodiment a common FBCH resource region in a particular UL TS is shared by multiple DL TS s where the resource region is specified via a D CCCH in one of the DL TS s.

In an FBCH there may be multiple feedback entries. A FBCH feedback entry may be defined as the information symbols that an MS uses to report its feedback. Entries from multiple MS s may be multiplexed

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention a FBCH feedback entry may be transmitted by an MS using a particular MCS and the modulation method can be either coherent or non coherent e.g. orthogonal or bi orthogonal techniques . Furthermore the MCS for a type of FBCH e.g. CQI may be different from that for another type e.g. ACK .

In an embodiment a fixed MCS can be predefined based on deployment conditions for all the feedback entries in an FBCH. Alternatively a semi static MCS may be used for all the feedback entries in an FBCH where the decision on the particular MCS to be used is based on the long term coverage statistics reported by the MS s and the MCS to be used is specified within a superframe in a type of SFCH.

In another embodiment adaptive modulation and coding AMC can also be used for an individual feedback entry or a group of feedback entries in an FBCH where the decisions on the MCS s are made by the serving BS based on certain criteria e.g. the history of signal reception quality from previous UL transmission of data or FBCH entries by the MS s . The instructions on the MCS may be provided in an entry or entries in a D CCCH. The AMC instruction may consist of a number of bits that identify one of the predefined MCS s. For example the MCS instructions for a type of CQI FBCH are tabulated in Table 3 where each CQI feedback entry uses four information bits.

In yet another embodiment the AMC may be used in conjunction with power control to transmission of an FBCH. The MCS for an MS or a group of MS s is first determined and the transmission power level is adjusted based on some criteria. Alternatively the transmission power level may first be determined and the MCS adjusted to meet some transmission requirements.

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention the specifications of the FBCH feedback entries e.g. their locations MCS s and corresponding MS s may be broadcasted by the serving BS to its MS s via a type of D CCCH. The specifications of the FBCH feedback entries may be explicitly defined in an entry of a D CCCH. For example the FBCH assignment entry can be established in the D CCCH to provide the specifications of the FBCH feedback entries 

Alternatively the specifications of the FBCH feedback entries can be embedded in the DL resource assignment entry. For example 

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention rules explicit or otherwise may be established to reduce the overhead in the specifications of the FBCH feedback entries and to efficiently make use of a FBCH resource region.

In an embodiment a reference point e.g. the starting coordinate of a FBCH resource region may be specified in a D CCCH entry whereas the location information for each FBCH feedback entry is omitted from the DL resource assignment entry in a D CCCH. Each MS decodes the relevant information about all the FBCH feedback entries in its group given in the DL resource assignment entries in a D CCCH and deduce based on the established rule the location where its feedback entry is with respect to the given FBCH resource region. The established rule which is understood by both the serving BS and its MS s without ambiguity can correspond to the assignment order in the D CCCH entry to the MCS instructions or other type of associations. For example MS s may fill in the given FBCH resource region with their feedback entries in the same sequential order as they are in the DL resource assignment entry as depicted in example in . In another example where fragmentation i.e. a feedback entry is placed across two or more OFDM symbols is undesirable MS s may fill in the given FBCH with their feedback entries in the order primarily based on their MCS s and secondarily based on the sequential order in the DL resource assignment entry as depicted in the other example in .

Any portion of an FBCH resource region that has not been used for the intended feedbacks can be used for other purposes. For example the serving BS may explicitly assign the residue resource for some MS s to send other types of feedback entries. Alternatively MS s can contend for the use of residue resource via a specific random access protocol.

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention multiple antennas e.g. beamforming or diversity combining can be used in the reception of an FBCH. The antenna weights at the serving BS can be derived

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention basic transmission units e.g. OFDM symbols or TS s in time can be reconfigured to form larger or smaller units to meet the requirements of certain applications such as for larger or smaller cell operations or same frequency network SFN application e.g. video broadcast . The information on the reconfiguration of basic units is indicated in the SFCH.

In an embodiment multiple regular consecutive OFDM symbols may be combined to form a longer symbol the CP length of which may be different from that of a regular OFDM symbol. An example is depicted in where two symbols are combined into a longer symbol . Conversely a regular OFDM symbol may be divided to form multiple shorter consecutive OFDM symbols.

In another embodiment within a subframe multiple regular consecutive DL TS s may be combined to form a longer time slot wherein additional guard times may be inserted to the beginning and the end of the longer time slot and wherein regular or longer OFDM symbols may be used see .

In yet another embodiment during the longer time slots some BS s do not transmit while some BS s specifically set up for large area broadcasting are transmitting.

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention information data in a TS may be encoded together with the information data in other TS s. These TS s are not necessarily consecutive or within the same subframe as depicted in by subframes and .

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention an MS may feed back to its serving BS the statistic information on signal propagation conditions related to the applications e.g. unicast data broadcast video in the present band broadcast video in other bands and geographic locations. The serving BS may adjust and reconfigure based on the long term statistics collected from multiple MS s the operation parameters and configurations to optimize system performance. In an embodiment a BS may transmit data via a broadcast channel and MS s may transmit the statistics about the DL broadcast channel via the UL unicast channels. Based on the feedback information the BS may adjust the pilot structure transmission power antenna configuration modulation and coding scheme and operation parameters to optimize the performance capacity of this particular broadcast channel.

In accordance with other embodiments of this invention multiple DL broadcast TS s may be grouped into bursts. Each burst carries an application data stream. A schedule for the bursts indicates the control and decoding information for each stream and is announced to the subscribing MS s via a particular means.

In one embodiment the burst schedule may be transmitted periodically in a scheduling message. The resource allocation for the scheduling message is fixed and known to the subscribing MS s. Alternatively the resource allocation for the scheduling message is specified in the SFCH.

In another embodiment the burst schedule can be transmitted in a DL broadcast TS in a DL unicast TS. Furthermore the burst scheduling information common to a group of cells may be transmitted by such a group of BS s using the same subcarriers including data and pilot subcarriers at essentially the same time wherein macro diversity can be achieved at the MS to decode the burst scheduling information. Alternatively the burst scheduling information can be transmitted by each individual BS with cell specific signals.
