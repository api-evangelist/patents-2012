title: Memory system for storing and retrieving experience and knowledge by utilizing natural language responses
abstract: A memory system for storing and retrieving experience and knowledge with natural language through methods and apparatus is disclosed. The primary components of this memory system include syntactic processes, function word processes, ellipsis processes, morphology processes, meaning word sense number processes, purpose identification processes, plausibility and expectedness processes, communication processes, context storage processes, and text generation processes. The function word processes select and evaluate functions associated with function words. A word sense number is an address to the meaning of a word. Word sense numbers are selected to be consistent with the context and stored experience and knowledge. Experience and knowledge are stored as nodes with access conditions and with associated clause implying word sense numbers organized into paths in a directed graph. A path has an associated purpose relation which is any concept that labels the path. Text generation processes generate natural language text from word sense numbers.
