This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 446 885 filed Feb. 25 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The disclosure relates generally to data processing systems and methods and more specifically to systems and methods for using data processing resources provided as a service known as cloud computing and to systems and methods for providing security for cloud computing.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. For example cloud computing allows a consumer to obtain data processing resources such as networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services as a service on a temporary basis when needed. Several vendors are currently offering various cloud services. For example such services include infrastructure as a service platform as a service storage as a service software as a service and business process as a service cloud services. These services use vendor specific service requests access and consumption models.

A consumer of cloud computing services may have its own data processing system resources. For example the consumer may be a business or other entity. The consumer may have invested in its own data processing system resources. These resources may include a computer network. The consumer s computer network provides a limited amount of processing capability and data storage resources. The consumer s computer network also provides specific data processing applications. The consumer s computer network may be located on premise and may be operated as a private cloud.

At certain times the consumer may require data processing resources beyond those available in its computer network. For example at certain times the demand for data processing resources may outstrip the capability of the consumer s computer network. At these times the response time of the consumer s computer network for some applications may increase to unacceptable levels. At other times the consumer may require data processing applications that are not available on the consumer s own computer network. For example the consumer may require at times the use of data processing applications that are not part of the consumer s core competency.

At those times when the consumer requires data processing resources beyond its own the consumer may purchase such resources as a service on a temporary basis from a provider of cloud computing services. For example the consumer may obtain additional processing or storage resources or specific application functionality as a service on a temporary basis from the cloud computing provider s data processing resources. Different types of service offerings may provide parts of the solution used in processing the consumer s workload. The provider s available data processing resources is known as a public cloud.

The consumer typically continues to operate its own computer network while some data processing resources are being obtained from a public cloud. Thus data processing resources from the public cloud typically are obtained in order to supplement the data processing resources of the consumer s own private cloud at certain times of need. The simultaneous and coordinated operation of data processing resources from multiple clouds may be referred to as hybrid cloud computing. For example operation of the consumer s private cloud along with resources obtained from one or more public clouds is a specific example of hybrid cloud computing.

According to one illustrative embodiment a computer program product for selectively providing security and network isolation of data processing environments is provided. The computer program product comprises a computer readable storage medium having first and second program instructions stored thereon. The first program instructions define a number of security zones wherein each of the number of security zones comprises a security policy defining access of each service instance that is a member of a security zone in the number of security zones. The second program instructions associate a service instance as a member of a security zone wherein the service instance comprises a data processing resource provided as a service by a provider of data processing resources wherein the data processing resource is selected from data processing resources that are part of a data center data processing resources that are part of a private cloud data processing resources that are part of a public cloud or data processing resources that are part of a hybrid cloud comprising a number of public clouds and a number of private clouds.

According to another illustrative embodiment a method for providing security and network isolation for data processing environments is provided. A service instance may be associated as a member of a security zone by a processor unit. The service instance may comprise a data processing resource provided as a service by a provider of data processing resources. The security zone comprises a security policy defining access of each service instance that is a member of the security zone.

According to another illustrative embodiment an apparatus comprising a processor unit configured to associate a service instance as a member of a security zone is provided. The service instance comprises a data processing resource provided as a service by a provider of data processing resources. The security zone comprises a security policy defining access of each service instance that is a member of the security zone.

According to another illustrative embodiment a method for selectively providing security and network isolation for data processing environments is provided. A service instance is defined by a processor unit as a member of a number of security zones. The service instance comprises a data processing resource provided as a service by a provider of data processing resources. Each of the number of security zones comprises a security policy. The security policy of the number of security zones of which the service instance is defined as a member is then applied by the processor unit to the service instance.

Further objects features and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description and taking into consideration the attached drawing figures.

It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather the illustrative embodiments are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.

For convenience the detailed description includes the following definitions which have been derived from the Draft NIST Working Definition of Cloud Computing by Peter Mell and Tim Grance dated Oct. 7 2009.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or data center .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based e mail . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or consumer acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds and service interoperability.

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

Referring now to a schematic of an example of a cloud computing node is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

Computer system server may be described in the general context of computer system executable instructions such as program modules being executed by a computer system. Generally program modules may include routines programs objects components logic data structures and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer system server may be practiced in distributed cloud computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed cloud computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.

As shown in computer system server in cloud computing node is shown in the form of a general purpose computing device. The components of computer system server may include but are not limited to one or more processors or processor unit system memory and bus that couples various system components including system memory to processor unit .

Processor unit executes instructions for software that may be loaded into system memory . Processor unit may be a number of processors a multi processor core or some other type of processor depending on the particular implementation. A number as used herein with reference to an item means one or more items. Further processor unit may be implemented using a number of heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example processor unit may be a symmetric multi processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.

Bus represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus an accelerated graphics port and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example and not limitation such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture ISA bus Micro Channel Architecture MCA bus Enhanced ISA EISA bus Video Electronics Standards Association VESA local bus and Peripheral Component Interconnects PCI bus.

Computer system server typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system server and it includes both volatile media non volatile media removable media and non removable media.

System memory can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory such as random access memory RAM and or cache memory . Computer system server may further include other removable non removable and volatile non volatile computer system storage media. By way of example only storage system can be provided for reading from and writing to a non removable non volatile magnetic media not shown and typically called a hard drive . Although not shown a magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to a removable non volatile magnetic disk e.g. a floppy disk and an optical disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable non volatile optical disk such as a CD ROM DVD ROM or other optical media can be provided. In such instances each can be connected to bus by one or more data media interfaces. As will be further depicted and described below memory may include at least one program product having a set e.g. at least one of program modules that are configured to carry out the functions of embodiments of the illustrative embodiments.

Each of the operating systems one or more application programs other program modules and program data or some combination thereof may include an implementation of a networking environment. Program modules generally carry out the functions and or methodologies of the illustrative embodiments as described herein.

Computer system server may also communicate with one or more external devices such as a keyboard a pointing device display etc. one or more devices that enable a user to interact with computer system server and or any devices e.g. network card modem etc. that enable computer system server to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via I O interfaces . Still yet computer system server can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network LAN a general wide area network WAN and or a public network e.g. the Internet via network adapter . As depicted network adapter communicates with the other components of computer system server via bus . It should be understood that although not shown other hardware and or software components could be used in conjunction with computer system server . Examples include but are not limited to microcode device drivers redundant processing units external disk drive arrays RAID systems tape drives and data archival storage systems etc.

Referring now to an illustration of a cloud computing environment is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this illustrative example cloud computing environment comprises one or more cloud computing nodes with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers may communicate. For example cloud computing node in is one example of cloud computing nodes . Local computing devices which may communicate with cloud computing nodes may include for example personal digital assistant PDA or cellular telephone A desktop computer B laptop computer C and or automobile computer system N. Cloud computing nodes may communicate with one another. They may be grouped not shown physically or virtually in one or more networks such as private community public or hybrid clouds as described hereinabove or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment to offer infrastructure platforms and or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A B C and N shown in are intended to be illustrative only and that cloud computing nodes and cloud computing environment can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and or network addressable connection e.g. using a web browser . Program code located on one of cloud computing nodes may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium in one of cloud computing nodes and downloaded to a computing device within computing devices A B C and N over a network for use in these computing devices. For example a server computer in cloud computing nodes may store program code on a computer readable storage medium on the server computer. The server computer may download the program code to a client computer in computing devices A B C and N for use on the client computer.

Referring now to a set of functional abstraction layers is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account a number of different considerations. For example the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that many enterprises have an existing investment in information technology resources. These enterprises want to use their existing infrastructure software and management resources. At times such enterprises also may want to augment their own data processing resources selectively with cloud based services. Thus for economic and functional reasons there may be a need to use on premise enterprise infrastructure platform applications or data and off premise cloud service infrastructure platform applications or data in an integrated manner.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that in cases of cloud computing server network data and applications used in processing the enterprise workload may reside within an enterprise data center may be with partners of the enterprise or may reside over the Internet in a public cloud. Thus processing a workload using a combination of on premise enterprise resources and public cloud resources involves using some of the on premise infrastructure platform applications or data as well as some off premise cloud based services and data. Cloud computing solutions of this type may create integration interoperability management and security challenges.

For example the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that cloud computing consumers desire to maintain a seamless interface across on premise and off premise cloud boundaries. However the governing policies for cloud operation and security related procedures always need to be in place. These competing requirements create the need for an integrated infrastructure and management solution that can span across the consumer data center and into one or more public cloud environments.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that easy access to public cloud services allows such services to be consumed within an enterprise in a non centralized and unmanaged manner. De centralizing and moving data processing resources to off site vendors increases the complexity and time required to support them. Typically this complexity is only evident when the cloud resources being consumed are reported to the enterprise information technology department. Security and system governance lapses may result from this lack of management. Regulatory and business compliance may require policy based data sharing across a hybrid cloud. However current unmanaged methods for accessing cloud service resources cannot guarantee such compliance. The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account the desirability of controlling cloud vendor selection based on business conditions and established policies.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that policy based workload management across a hybrid cloud and automated support of cloud computing services will reduce information technology costs. Such hybrid cloud management and support will improve security and compliance and thereby will increase enterprise adoption of cloud technologies.

Various providers of cloud services use vendor specific service request access and consumption models. The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account the desirability of a vender neutral and service specific interface to all clouds that provide a desired cloud service.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that integrated monitoring of data processing resources and workload processing across a hybrid cloud is needed to establish automated policy based workload management. However such integrated monitoring cannot be achieved using existing solutions. Existing solutions for monitoring data processing resources and workload processing are not adapted for the dynamic nature of hybrid cloud computing environments. In particular such solutions are not adapted for hybrid cloud environments formed of separate dynamic networks of data processing resources that often must be separated from each other by firewalls to provide appropriate levels of security.

Therefore the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account the need for an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution that can span across a hybrid cloud computing environment. In particular the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account the need for an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution that can span across a customer data center into one or more public cloud environments. The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that consumers of data processing resources desire to view the state of a workload running on a hybrid cloud using a single integrated view. An integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution in accordance with an illustrative embodiment makes possible such an integrated view.

The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account that such an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution should be implemented and maintained as efficiently as possible. For example any required changes to monitoring agents or to other parts of the monitoring infrastructure should be minimized and confined to as few components as possible. Currently available solutions for monitoring data processing resources and workload processing do not provide such efficiency. Currently available solutions for monitoring data processing resources and workload processing are too cumbersome to set up and use particularly in a hybrid cloud computing environment.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a hybrid cloud integrator provides for integration of on premise infrastructure platform applications and data with public cloud based infrastructure platform services and data. A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to extend on premise data center capabilities by augmenting such capabilities with data processing capabilities provided in a public cloud. For example such cloud based capabilities may include infrastructure as a service or storage as a service capabilities. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the desired solution for processing a workload may be implemented in a hybrid cloud environment that integrates multiple private cloud and public cloud based services.

A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to extend the reach of a consumer s on premise data processing monitoring and management functionality to monitor and manage the data processing resource capabilities extended in a public cloud. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a hybrid cloud computing environment including both private cloud and public cloud based services may be monitored and managed in a more effective manner as a single logical cloud of resources. Hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment allows policy based integration of infrastructure services and data across the hybrid cloud. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment monitoring and management of the integrated infrastructure and services can be performed in a centralized manner. In this way workload specific actions can be taken consistently and in a vendor neutral manner even if the components of the workload are processed using multiple cloud based services.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a hybrid cloud integrator provides an integration platform for integrating workload monitoring and management across a hybrid cloud. The hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may comprise a hybrid cloud integrator framework. Hybrid cloud integration components may be plugged in to the framework as needed in a systematic manner.

For example in accordance with an illustrative embodiment integration components that may be plugged in to the hybrid cloud integrator framework may include a cloud service broker plug in a cloud monitoring plug in and a cloud security services plug in. Together the plug ins may be used to provision and configure an on premise or consumer side monitoring gateway and an off premise or provider cloud side monitoring gateway. These gateways are employed to provide for integrated workload monitoring across a hybrid cloud.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a consumer of data processing resources may use the integration components provided in the hybrid cloud integrator to identify and define hybrid cloud monitoring participants across the hybrid cloud. Such participants may include both an on premise monitoring infrastructure and one or more off premise cloud based services that are to be monitored using the on premise monitoring infrastructure. The consumer of data processing resources may specify parameters needed to enable integration for hybrid cloud monitoring. For example such parameters may include port identifications Internet Protocol or other addresses encryption methods used and the like. Coordination of actions among the integration component plug ins is automated so that implementation of the hybrid cloud monitoring setup may be completed automatically. Thus illustrative embodiments provide for the efficient set up of an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution for hybrid cloud monitoring.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment data processing service instances in a cloud may be monitored using monitoring agents. The monitoring agents may provide monitored data to an on premise monitoring infrastructure via the hybrid cloud integration structure established using the hybrid cloud integrator. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment as additional data processing service instances are established in the cloud or as data processing service instances are terminated monitoring of already established or remaining instances may continue without requiring changes in the monitoring agents for those instances or in the rest of the monitoring infrastructure. Thus illustrative embodiments provide for the efficient maintenance and operation of an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution for hybrid cloud monitoring.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that current cloud based services accessible over the internet are provided by multiple vendors. Multiple vendors may offer directly competing services. For example both IBM SBDTC and Amazon EC2 offer infrastructure as a service cloud services. Different protocols and application programming interfaces are required for interfacing with these competing services. Currently consumers of these services have to develop and maintain vendor specific code to access the same service from different vendors. Consumers of cloud computing services would prefer to maintain a single vendor neutral and service specific interface to all clouds that provide a desired service. Consumers also desire to control vendor selection based on business considerations.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that consumers of data processing resources may employ multiple cloud service instances to process the consumer s workload. In many cases appropriate security must be established and maintained between and among such multiple cloud service instances. Network isolation requirements may vary from instance to instance. Therefore customization of network isolation settings may be required or desired. For example some service instances may need to be accessible from an external network others from on premise instances on an intranet and yet others from a subset of instances in a cloud. Furthermore if the role of a service instance changes its network isolation requirement may need to be changed.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that cloud service instances typically have default network isolation and privacy settings. These default settings may be defined by the service instance itself and by a firewall for the cloud in which the service instance is instantiated. In this case changes and updates to the network isolation and privacy settings need to be made manually and on an instance by instance basis. Manual changes may be tedious error prone and costly.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a consumer of data processing resources may define virtual security zones. Such security zones may be managed by the consumer of data processing resources without any additional support from the cloud service provider. Multiple security zones may be defined with different security properties associated with each security zone. Service instances may be added or removed to a predefined security zone. A single service instance may be a member of one or more security zones. The security properties for any given security zone are applied to all of the instances that are members of that security zone. Security properties associated with a security zone may be modified. In this case any changes may be applied automatically to all service instances that are members of the changed security zone.

Referring now to a block diagram of a data processing environment employing hybrid cloud integration is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Data processing environment includes consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . In some embodiments provider data processing resources may be referred to as first data processing resources and consumer data processing resources may be referred to as second data processing resources or vice versa.

Consumer data processing resources may include data processing resources that are owned or controlled exclusively by consumer of data processing resources . For example consumer of data processing resources may be a business entity or other organization or enterprise that uses consumer data processing resources to process consumer processed consumer workload .

Consumer data processing resources may include any combination of data processing systems and devices for processing consumer processed consumer workload . For example consumer data processing resources may include any combination of data processing infrastructure networks processors data storage databases and applications.

Consumer data processing resources may include or may be referred to as private cloud . Consumer data processing resources may include data processing resources that are located on premise or may be referred to as being on premise . On premise may mean that all of consumer data processing resources are co located in a single location that is owned or controlled by consumer of data processing resources that also owns or controls consumer data processing resources . Alternatively on premise may mean that consumer data processing resources are under the control of consumer of data processing resources for exclusive use by consumer of data processing resources even though some or all of consumer data processing resources are physically located in a number of remote locations.

Provider data processing resources are data processing resources that are available to be shared by a number of consumers of data processing resources including consumer of data processing resources . Provider data processing resources may include any combination of data processing systems or devices. For example provider data processing resources may include any combination of data processing infrastructure networks processors data storage or applications.

Provider data processing resources may be provided as services . For example provider data processing resources may be provided as services by public cloud . Public cloud makes provider data processing resources available to consumer of data processing resources as services . For example services may include one or more of infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service or other data processing related services.

At certain times consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload . Provider processed consumer workload typically is a portion of all of consumer workload that consumer of data processing resources needs to be processed. In some cases provider processed consumer workload may be all of consumer workload that consumer of data processing resources needs to be processed. For example consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when consumer data processing resources are overloaded with processing consumer processed consumer workload . At other times consumer of data processing resources may employ provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when processing of provider processed consumer workload is not one of the core competencies of consumer of data processing resources . As another example consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when particular applications required to process provider processed consumer workload are not available among consumer data processing resources . In any case processing of provider processed consumer workload using provider data processing resources may require that a number of applications or data or both applications and data be provided to provider data processing resources in order to process provider processed consumer workload .

Thus at times all of consumer workload being processed by or for consumer of data processing resources may be processed in part as consumer processed consumer workload on consumer data processing resources such as private cloud and in part as provider processed consumer workload on provider data processing resources such as public cloud . In this case the integration of private cloud and public cloud to process consumer workload for consumer of data processing resources forms hybrid cloud .

Operation of hybrid cloud requires communication between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . However security concerns may require the prevention of unauthorized access to consumer data processing resources from provider data processing resources or from any other unauthorized sources. Therefore firewall may be provided between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Firewall is designed to block unauthorized access to consumer data processing resources by provider data processing resources or by any other unauthorized sources while permitting authorized communications between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Firewall may be implemented in either hardware or software or using a combination of both hardware and software. For example without limitation firewall may be implemented in consumer data processing resources .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator provides integration across consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources to implement integrated data processing resources forming hybrid cloud . For example without limitation hybrid cloud integrator may be implemented by consumer of data processing resources on consumer data processing resources .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator includes framework integration platform and a number of plug ins . For example framework may be implemented in software as a software framework. Framework may be implemented on integration platform . Integration platform provides the underlying hardware and software required to implement hybrid cloud integrator . For example integration platform may include the hardware operating system and runtime environment in which hybrid cloud integrator is implemented.

Framework provides plug in interface . Plug in interface allows a number of plug ins to be installed in hybrid cloud integrator . Plug ins are software components that are configured to provide functionality for integrated use of consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Plug ins may include for example a number of service deployment and integration components a number of data integration components and a number of management integration components .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment service deployment and integration components may be used by consumer of data processing resources to deploy services in provider data processing resources that are needed to process or monitor provider processed consumer workload . Service deployment and integration components also may be used to integrate services deployed in provider data processing resources with consumer data processing resources to provide integrated data processing resources to process consumer workload . For example service deployment and integration components may include cloud service broker plug in . As will be described in more detail below cloud service broker plug in may be used for provisioning provider data processing resources in public cloud for use by consumer of data processing resources .

Data integration components may be used by consumer of data processing resources to migrate replicate transform and integrate data used in processing consumer workload between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Service deployment and integration components and data integration components may be used to enforce workload and data specific deployment and integration policies specified by consumer of data processing resources .

Management integration components may include any components that may be used by consumer of data processing resources to monitor and manage the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources . Management integration components may include plug in components that may be used by consumer of data processing resources to monitor the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources in order to manage such processing. For example management integration components may include cloud monitoring plug in and cloud security service plug in . As will be described in more detail below cloud monitoring plug in may be used for managing monitoring of processing of provider processed consumer workload on provider data processing resources . Cloud security service plug in may be used for managing security for the monitoring of the processing of provider processed consumer workload on provider data processing resources . Management integration components may also or alternatively include metering components or other management related components.

Operating characteristics of plug ins are defined by configuration data . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment framework may provide service connectivity management function . Service connectivity management function allows current configuration data from plug ins and other information about plug ins to be made available to a user on user interface . Service connectivity management function also allows configuration data to be received from user interface for plug ins . Thus service connectivity management function provides a connection between plug ins and user interface allowing users to view and change the operating configuration of plug ins via user interface .

Framework also may provide runtime management function . Runtime management function provides for managing operation of plug ins during operation thereof. Specifically runtime management function may provide for activating plug ins and for controlling operation of plug ins after plug ins are activated.

Framework also may provide communication between plug ins . Communication between plug ins allows plug ins to interact with each other. For example communication between plug ins allows one of plug ins to access and make use of the functionality provided by another of plug ins in framework .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator provides flexible and reliable automated integration of data processing resources across hybrid cloud to process a workload. For example hybrid cloud integrator may be used by workload manager to access provider data processing resources automatically when needed to supplement consumer data processing resources . Hybrid cloud integrator also may be used by workload manager to monitor the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources .

Workload manager may provide automated workload management . Automated workload management includes automatically managing workload processing on available data processing resources. An example of a system that provides this type of automated workload management is the IBM Tivoli Service Automation Manager TSAM available from International Business Machines Corporation. Illustrative embodiments may be used however in combination with any currently available workload manager providing automated workload management functions or with any workload manager that may become available in the future. Illustrative embodiment also may be used in combination with workload managers in which automated workload management functions are implemented in combination with a human operator.

Workload manager may provide automated workload management based on policies . Policies may define limitations under which workload manager may use available data processing resources. For example policies may define when or under what conditions workload manager may use provider data processing resources to process consumer workload . Policies also may specify which provider data processing resources may be used to process consumer workload . Policies also may specify consumer data that may be replicated and accessed by provider data processing resources and the portion of consumer workload that may be processed by provider data processing resources . Policies may specify security and privacy constraints that must be applied for processing consumer workload by provider data processing resources .

Policies may be developed using business rules management engine . Business rules management engine may take into consideration a variety of business related and other factors to determine policies . For example factors used by business rules management engine to determine policies may include financial security compliance customer relations factors or other suitable factors.

Workload manager may provide automatic policy based provisioning based on policies . For example policy based provisioning may call for the provisioning of provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload . In this case workload manager may use hybrid cloud integrator to deploy provider data processing resources needed to process provider processed consumer workload . For example service deployment and integration components may be used to deploy services in public cloud that are needed to process provider processed consumer workload . Service deployment and integration components may establish communication with provider data processing resources through firewall . For example such communication may be established via application programming interface portal in public cloud . Applications data or both applications and data needed for processing provider processed consumer workload may be provided to provider data processing resources by workload manager via hybrid cloud integrator .

Hybrid cloud integrator also may be used to establish workload processing image in public cloud . Workload processing image pre defines services needed to process provider processed consumer workload . By establishing workload processing image in advance provider data processing resources needed to process provider processed consumer workload may be deployed more rapidly when workload manager determines that provider data processing resources will be used for this purpose.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator allows workload manager to access provider data processing resources as easily as consumer data processing resources . Plug ins in hybrid cloud integrator handle all of the special requirements of provider data processing resources needed to access those resources.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator also provides for monitoring the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources . For example as will be described in more detail below service deployment and integration components and management integration components may be used to establish and manage monitoring of the processing of provider processed consumer workload . Monitored data from provider data processing resources may be provided to monitoring infrastructure via hybrid cloud integrator . Similarly consumer processing monitoring agent may be implemented in consumer data processing resources . Consumer processing monitoring agent collects data for monitoring the processing of consumer processed consumer workload by consumer data processing resources . Monitored data from consumer data processing resources may be provided from consumer processing monitoring agent to monitoring infrastructure .

Monitoring infrastructure may be implemented in consumer data processing resources . Monitoring infrastructure may receive monitoring information for provider data processing resources via hybrid cloud integrator and monitoring information from consumer processing monitoring agent for consumer data processing resources . Monitoring infrastructure may process the received monitoring information to generate an integrated display of workload processing conditions for provider data processing resources and consumer data processing resources . This integrated display may be presented to a user such as a system administrator on monitoring station . Thus in accordance with an illustrative embodiment a display of workload processing conditions across hybrid cloud may be presented to a user in an integrated manner. Such an integrated display allows a user to monitor and manage workload processing across hybrid cloud in an integrated effective and efficient manner.

Monitoring infrastructure also may look for and detect the occurrence of events from the monitoring information provided to monitoring infrastructure . Events may be defined by the occurrence of specified conditions or patterns in the monitored data. For example monitored data exceeding a defined threshold for at least a specified time period may indicate the occurrence of one of events . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment events may be defined by the occurrence of any condition state or pattern of interest in the monitored data provided to monitoring infrastructure .

Events may be provided as input to event correlation and aggregation function . Event correlation and aggregation function may provide and may be referred to as an event correlation service. Event correlation and aggregation function may aggregate and correlate events over periods of time. Event correlation and aggregation function may determine whether the aggregated and correlated events indicate the presence of data processing conditions that should be or may be addressed to maintain or improve system performance. For example event correlation and aggregation function may determine that a series of detected events has occurred indicating that consumer data processing resources or provider data processing resources are overloaded. Similarly event correlation and aggregation function may determine that a series of detected events has occurred indicating that consumer data processing resources or provider data processing resources are being underutilized. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment any data processing condition of interest that may be defined by aggregated or correlated events may be detected by event correlation and aggregation function .

In response to a determination by event correlation and aggregation function that a data processing condition of interest exists service desk ticketing function may send event based service request to workload manager . For example service desk ticketing function may generate event based service request in response to a determination by event correlation and aggregation function that a data processing condition exists that should be or may be addressed to maintain or improve system performance. Event based service request may indicate to workload manager the particular condition that has been determined to exist. In this case workload manager may determine the appropriate action to take in response to the indicated condition. Alternatively service desk ticketing function may determine the action that needs to be taken in response to a particular condition that has been determined to exist. In this case event based service request may indicate to workload manager the action that is being requested.

In any case workload manager may determine whether or not any action may be taken in response to a particular data processing condition based on policies . If workload manager determines that action will be taken in response to a particular data processing condition workload manager may implement such action based on policies . For example workload manager may respond to event based service request by implementing appropriate policy based provisioning of data processing resources as needed to respond to a detected data processing condition.

Workload manager also may respond to event based service request by generating service fulfillment response . For example service fulfillment response may be generated by workload manager and delivered to service desk ticketing function . Service fulfillment response may indicate that event based service request has been received by workload manager . Service fulfillment response also may indicate that appropriate action has been taken or will be taken in response to event based service request . In this case service fulfillment response may or may not specify the particular action taken or to be taken by workload manager in response to event based service request . In some cases workload manager may not be able to take action to change data processing conditions in response to event based service request . For example policies may prevent workload manager from taking action in response to event based service request at a particular time. In this case service fulfillment response may indicate that action will not be taken by workload manager in response to event based service request or that the implementation of such action may be delayed. Policies responsible for such a failure to act or for such a delay may or may not be identified in service fulfillment response .

The information provided by event based service request and service fulfillment response may be formatted appropriately and displayed for a user on monitoring station . By displaying information from event based service request and service fulfillment response in this manner a user is able to monitor the detection of data processing system conditions for which an appropriate action may be taken and the response of workload manager to the detection of such conditions.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to respond to determined data processing conditions of interest in consumer data processing resources in provider data processing resources or both. Furthermore hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to access consumer data processing resources provider data processing resources or both for responding to determined conditions of interest. Thus hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to provide integrated data processing resource management across hybrid cloud by providing for monitoring of data processing conditions across hybrid cloud and by providing access to data processing resources across hybrid cloud when responding to such conditions.

For example hybrid cloud integrator may be used to establish monitoring of the processing of portions of consumer workload by provider data processing resources while processing of other portions of consumer workload by consumer data processing resources also is monitored at the same time. Based on such monitoring an overload condition or underutilization condition on consumer data processing resources on provider data processing resources or both may be determined. In response to such a determination workload manager may activate or deactivate selected consumer data processing resources may deploy or release selected provider data processing resources using hybrid cloud integrator in the manner described or both. Processing of portions of consumer workload then may be allocated by workload manager across the reconfigured resources of hybrid cloud to remedy the determined overload or underutilization condition. The particular action taken by workload manager in response to the determined condition may be determined by policies .

Turning now to a block diagram of a data processing environment for monitoring data processing resources in accordance with an illustrative embodiment is depicted. In this example data processing environment is an example of one implementation of data processing environment in . In this example data processing environment comprises consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . One or more of consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources may comprise cloud based resources in which the data processing resources are provided as a service. In this case data processing environment may be referred to as a hybrid cloud.

Consumer data processing resources may comprise for example on premise data processing resources. For example consumer data processing resources may comprise data processing resources found in a customer data center. In other examples consumer data processing resources may comprise cloud based resources in which consumer data processing resources are provided as a service. For example consumer data processing resources may comprise private cloud or public cloud data processing resources. In any case various applications middleware components and other workload processing resources such as those represented by service instances and may be installed provisioned and configured by a consumer of data processing resources on consumer data processing resources . These processing resources may be referred to as workload processing service instances or simply as service instances. For example service instances and may be instantiated on consumer data processing resources to process all or portions of a consumer workload.

Provider data processing resources may comprise cloud based resources that are provided as a service. For example provider data processing resources may comprise infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service or other cloud services. In this example provider data processing resources comprise public clouds and . Public clouds and may be provided by different vendors. In this case knowledge of different application programming interfaces and other requirements may be needed in order to access the services on public clouds and .

Various cloud provided service instances and may be provisioned and configured to process the workload of a consumer of data processing resources in public clouds and . For example service instances and may be provisioned and configured by a consumer of cloud data processing resources to process portions of a consumer workload. The consumer of cloud data processing resources may employ hybrid cloud integrator to provision resources on public clouds and to instantiate service instances and . In this example hybrid cloud integrator is implemented on consumer data processing resources .

A consumer of data processing resources will desire to manage service instances and across data processing environment in an integrated manner. Such integrated management requires integrated monitoring of service instances and across data processing environment . Such integrated monitoring may be provided by monitoring infrastructure . For example monitoring infrastructure may be implemented on consumer data processing resources . Monitoring infrastructure may be implemented using any combination of hardware and software components to provide the desired integrated monitoring functionality. For example without limitation monitoring infrastructure may comprise an IBM Tivoli monitoring server for providing such integrated monitoring.

Monitoring of service instances and on consumer data processing resources may be straightforward. Consumer side monitoring agents and may be implemented on consumer data processing resources to monitor service instances and respectively. Consumer side monitoring agents and may be implemented in any manner to provide the desired functionality for monitoring service instances and and providing monitored data to monitoring infrastructure . For example consumer side monitoring agents and may push such monitored data to monitoring infrastructure . For example without limitation consumer side monitoring agents and may comprise IBM Tivoli monitoring agents.

Monitoring of service instances and on provider data processing resources by monitoring infrastructure may be more problematic. In many cases provider data processing resources may be separated from consumer data processing resources by one or more firewalls and . For example firewalls and may be provided by or associated with public clouds and respectively. Firewall may be provided by or associated with consumer data processing resources . In this case firewall may be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to consumer data processing resources from outside of consumer data processing resources . In particular firewall may prevent data from being pushed from provider data processing resources to consumer data processing resources .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment monitoring of service instances and on provider data processing resources by monitoring infrastructure is enabled by consumer side monitoring gateway operating in combination with provider side monitoring gateways and . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment consumer side monitoring gateway and provider side monitoring gateways and may be implemented using hybrid cloud integrator .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment consumer side monitoring gateway may be implemented by cloud monitoring service implemented in hybrid cloud integrator . For example cloud monitoring service may be implemented as a cloud monitoring plug in to the software framework provided by hybrid cloud integrator . Consumer side monitoring gateway may pull monitored data across firewall from provider side monitoring gateways and . Consumer side monitoring gateway may then push such monitored data to monitoring infrastructure .

Provider side monitoring gateways and may be provisioned configured and deployed using cloud service broker cloud security service and cloud monitoring service . For example cloud service broker may be implemented as a cloud service broker plug in to the software framework provided by hybrid cloud integrator . Cloud service broker may be used to provision provider side monitoring gateways and in public clouds and respectively. Cloud service broker also may be used by a consumer of data processing resources to provision resources in public clouds and for service instances and . Cloud service broker may provide a vendor neutral interface for a consumer of data processing resources to access provider data processing resources on various public clouds and without requiring specific knowledge of various different cloud interfaces by the consumer of data processing resources.

After provider side monitoring gateways and are provisioned by cloud service broker cloud service broker may activate cloud security service . Cloud security service may be implemented as a cloud security service plug in to the software framework provided by hybrid cloud integrator . Cloud security service may configure the firewall and access settings of provider side monitoring gateways and . These configuration settings may allow access to provider side monitoring gateways and only by authorized provider side monitoring agents and . These configuration settings also may restrict access to the monitored data collected in provider side monitoring gateways and to authorized consumer side monitoring gateway .

After cloud security service has completed the security and isolation configuration of provider side monitoring gateways and cloud service broker may activate cloud monitoring service to configure and start provider side monitoring gateways and . Cloud monitoring service may configure port settings for provider side monitoring gateways and so that provider side monitoring agents and can contact and communicate with their respective provider side monitoring gateway or . Cloud monitoring service also may configure provider side monitoring gateways and to listen on specific ports for contact by consumer side monitoring gateway . Cloud monitoring service also may configure consumer side monitoring gateway to contact provider side monitoring gateways and on the predefined ports and IP addresses. This configuration of provider side monitoring gateways and and consumer side monitoring gateway by cloud monitoring service allows for communication to take place between provider side monitoring gateways and and consumer side monitoring gateway .

Service instances and may be provisioned by cloud service broker . When each service instance and is provisioned cloud monitoring service may install configure and start a corresponding provider side monitoring agent and respectively. Thus to enable monitoring on service instances and in public clouds and cloud service broker and cloud monitoring service may coordinate with each other. In one illustrative embodiment cloud service broker provisions a service instance and invokes cloud security service . Cloud security service configures the service instances provisioned in the cloud so that cloud monitoring service can access the service instance and enable monitoring of the service via a monitoring agent. As discussed elsewhere herein cloud service broker cloud security service and cloud monitoring service may use communication services provided by the framework of hybrid cloud integrator . Further the framework of hybrid cloud integrator may provide for communication between plug in components of hybrid cloud integrator . The coordination between cloud service broker cloud security service and cloud monitoring service may use communication services provided by the framework of hybrid cloud integrator .

Provider side monitoring agents and may operate in a manner similar to consumer side monitoring agents and . In particular provider side monitoring agents and may monitor corresponding service instances and respectively and provide monitored data to provider side monitoring gateways and . This monitored data may be retained at provider side monitoring gateways and until the data is retrieved from provider side monitoring gateways and by consumer side monitoring gateway .

Cloud security service may be implemented as a cloud security service plug in to the software framework provided by hybrid cloud integrator . Cloud security service may be employed by cloud service broker when implementing provider side monitoring gateways and and provider side monitoring agents and to implement virtual private security zones. Such security zones may be used to ensure that appropriate security is maintained between service instances and operating on public clouds and while allowing for monitored data from service instances and to be shared with provider side monitoring gateways and and ultimately funneled through consumer side monitoring gateway to monitoring infrastructure . Virtual private security zones and the use thereof in various applications will be described in more detail below.

When activated provider side monitoring agents and monitor corresponding service instances and and provide corresponding monitored data to provider side monitoring gateways and . Consumer side monitoring gateway may then be activated to retrieve the monitored data across firewall from provider side monitoring gateways and . The retrieved monitored data then may be provided from consumer side monitoring gateway to monitoring infrastructure . From the point of view of monitoring infrastructure monitored data from service instances and on provider data processing resources may be received from provider side monitoring agents and respectively in the same manner as monitored data from service instances and on consumer data processing resources is received from consumer side monitoring agents and respectively. The operations performed by provider side monitoring gateways and and consumer side monitoring gateway thus may be transparent to monitoring infrastructure .

Monitoring infrastructure may generate an integrated view of monitored service instances and across data processing environment from the monitored data provided by consumer side monitoring agents and and provider side monitoring agents and respectively. This integrated view of monitored services may be presented to user via an interactive monitoring portal . For example user may be a system administrator. Monitoring portal may be accessed by user using a browser and used in an interactive manner on a monitoring dashboard. The integrated view of monitored services generated by monitoring infrastructure also may be used to provide for fully automated or partially automated management of data processing resources across data processing environment . For example the integrated view of monitored services generated by monitoring infrastructure may be used by an automated workload manager to provide fully automated or partially automated integrated workload management across data processing environment .

Example scenarios in accordance with illustrative embodiments for using the components of a hybrid cloud integrator to establish integrated monitoring of data processing resources across a hybrid cloud data processing environment are presented in more detail below.

Turning now to a block diagram of a data processing environment employing virtual private security zones in accordance with an illustrative embodiment is depicted. In this example data processing environment is an example of one implementation of data processing environment in or data processing environment in . In this example data processing environment comprises data processing resources . For example data processing resources may comprise data processing resources that are provided as a service. In this case data processing resources may comprise cloud computing resources. For example data processing resources may comprise a public cloud a private cloud or another type of cloud computing resource.

Multiple service instances and may be provisioned on data processing resources . For example service instances and may be provisioned and configured in the cloud by a consumer of data processing resources to process various portions of a consumer workload. Alternatively individual service instances and may be provisioned by different consumers of data processing resources to process various different consumer workloads. Based on established policies individual service instances and may be allowed to interact in certain prescribed manners. For example individual service instances and may need to share data in order to perform desired processing functions. On the other hand based on established policies individual service instances and may not be allowed to interact or share data. For example individual service instances and may not be allowed to interact or share data in cases where service instances and are provisioned to provide data processing resources for different consumers. As another example individual service instances and may not be allowed to interact or share data in cases where service instances and are provisioned to process different types of workloads of the same consumer that requires isolation among workloads. In such cases security policies may dictate that individual service instances and not be allowed to interact or share data.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment management of security and isolation among multiple data processing service instances is facilitated by the use of security zones. Such security zones may be used to define and implement particular security and isolation policies that apply to individual service instances or groups of service instances. The security policies for a service instance may define allowed inbound and outbound communications with applications and services running in the instance using specified ports and IP addresses. These policies may be defined based on the requirements associated with specific workloads with data being processed or with business processes accessing the data processing resources. Using the policies one or more security zones may be defined. These defined security zones then may be associated with service instances used to process workloads. When a new security policy is to be enforced a security zone conforming to that policy may first be defined. When a new service instance is created security and isolation policies for that service instance may be established easily by adding that new service instance to an appropriate existing security zone based on the workload process the service instance is to perform. In this case the new service instance inherits the security and isolation policy from the zone in which it is placed. Thus a new security and isolation policy need not be implemented individually for a new service instance where an appropriate security zone is already in existence. When a security and isolation policy needs to be changed the policy can be changed at the level of the security zone. This change may then be applied automatically to all service instances assigned to the changed security zone. Thus each service instance affected by a change in security and isolation policy need not be individually modified in response to a change in policy that affects multiple service instances.

In the example in two security zones are established security zone A and security zone B . In this example service instances and are members of security zone A . Service instances and are members of security zone B . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the members of a security zone share the same security policy.

For example in accordance with an illustrative embodiment security zone policy may dictate that member instances of a security zone have access to each other. Such access may be unrestricted access or may be restricted in some way defined by security zone policy. For example security zone policy may restrict access to specified ports. The security zone policy may also dictate that service instances do not have access to service instances that are not members of their security zone. Applying this example policy to the security zones in we see that service instances and have access to each other and to service instance because service instances and are members of the same security zone B . Service instances and do not have access to service instances and because these service instances are outside of security zone B and service instances and are only in security zone B . Service instances and have access to each other and to service instance because all of these service instances are members of security zone A . Service instances and do not have access to service instances and because these service instances are outside of security zone A and service instances and are only members of security zone A .

Individual service instances may be members of more than one security zone. In other words security zones may overlap. For example in service instance is a member of both security zone A and security zone B . Thus applying the example security policy just described service instance has access to all of the other service instances and and all of the other service instances have access to service instance .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment security zones may be implemented in data processing environment using hybrid cloud integrator . For example security zones may be implemented in data processing environment using cloud service broker and cloud security service components of hybrid cloud integrator . Cloud service broker may be implemented as a cloud service broker plug in to the software framework provided by hybrid cloud integrator . Cloud security service may be implemented as a cloud security service plug in to the software framework provided by hybrid cloud integrator .

Cloud security service may provide cloud security zone manager . Cloud security zone manager may be configured to manage security zone policies and memberships . For example security zone policies and memberships may comprise the security policies that apply to each of the number of security zones and the identity of the service instances that are members of the security zones. For each managed security zone cloud security zone manager may configure firewall and port settings of zone member service instances so that the desired security policy is implemented among service instances. Cloud security zone manager also may maintain access keys to security zone policies and memberships . A client such as workload management application may be allowed to change the policies or membership of a security zone only if the client is identified as the owner or authorized administrator for that security zone to the cloud security zone manager by presenting an appropriate one of access keys .

Cloud service broker may communicate with and access cloud security service to establish or modify the security of service instances when cloud service broker is invoked by the consumer of data processing services to provision or remove service instances on data processing resources . For example workload management application may send a request to provision services on data processing resources . For example workload management application may comprise an automated workload manager. Cloud service broker may provide a vendor neutral interface for workload management application to access data processing resources . Responsive to receiving the request from workload management application cloud service broker may provision a service instance on data processing resources to satisfy the request. Cloud service broker may then pass the request along with access credentials from workload management application to cloud security service . In response cloud security service uses the stored management keys and zone policy definitions to apply the security policies to the new service instance. For example without limitation this may include modifications to the firewall rules of the service instance. Cloud security service also adds the new service instance as a member of the appropriate security zone or zones.

By the use of cloud security service workload management application need not specify individual security policies for each new service instance requested. When requesting a new service instance workload management application only needs to identify to cloud service broker the appropriate security zone or zones of which the new instance is to be a member. Cloud service broker then may use cloud security service to apply automatically the appropriate security policies to the new service instance.

Application of security policies by cloud security service may be implemented in multiple ways dependent on the services available by the cloud services provider. For example without limitation the security policies may be applied directly to service instances and to hypervisors hosting service instances and or to network devices that connect service instances and . Cloud security service may use the public interfaces of the security mechanisms provided by the cloud service providers to apply the security policies necessary for the isolation of service instances and .

If workload management application or another application needs to change a security policy that affects many individual service instances that change may be implemented as a change to security zone policy via cloud security service . Cloud security service knows which instances are members of the security zones to which the changes are to be applied. Workload management application or the other application need not make such a policy change by accessing and changing all of the affected service instances individually.

Turning now to a block diagram of a data processing environment employing virtual private security zones for monitoring data processing resources in accordance with an illustrative embodiment is depicted. In this example service instances and and provider side monitoring gateway are implemented on data processing resources . Instances and and provider side monitoring gateway are members of security zone A . Instances and and provider side monitoring gateway are members of security zone B . Provider side monitoring gateway is the only member of security zone G .

In this example security zone A and security zone B may represent zones comprising service instances processing distinct workloads. All of service instances and can share data with provider side monitoring gateway because provider side monitoring gateway is a member of both security zone A and security zone B . However service instances and that are only in security zone A cannot access service instances and that are only in security zone B and vice versa.

Security zone G is a separate zone for provider side monitoring gateway . Security zone G thus may be defined by security policies that are particularly relevant to operation of provider side monitoring gateway . For example security policy for security zone G may define permissions allowing access to provider side monitoring gateway by consumer side monitoring gateway . As described above consumer side monitoring gateway may be implemented in hybrid cloud integrator on separate data processing resources from data processing resources .

Turning now to a block diagram of a data processing environment employing virtual private security zones for a web server application in accordance with an illustrative embodiment is depicted. In this example security zone W is a defined zone for one or more web servers . Security policy for security zone W is defined to permit access to web servers from external internet . Security zone A includes all of security zone W and a number of application server instances and . Security policy for security zone A may deny access to and from external internet by and to application server instances and . However security policy for security zone A may grant access to application server instances and by customer enterprise workload manager application servers . Web servers are members of both security zone W and security zone A . Therefore access is permitted between web servers and application server instances and .

Turning now to a block diagram of a data processing environment employing virtual private security zones for a web server application with proxy in accordance with an illustrative embodiment is depicted. In this example security zone P contains web proxy . Security policy for security zone P may provide that web proxy has access from and to external internet . Security zone W is defined for one or more web servers and includes web proxy . Security policy for security zone W may deny access from and to external internet to and by web servers . However since they are in the same security zone W web proxy can talk with web servers . Security zone A includes web servers and application server instances and . Security policy for security zone A may provide that access to and from external internet by and to application server instances and is denied. However policy for security zone A may grant access to application server instances and by customer enterprise workload manager application servers . In this example web servers cannot be accessed directly from external internet . However web servers can be accessed from external internet indirectly via web proxy . Application server instances and have access to and from web servers because web servers are included in security zone A with application server instances and .

Referring now to a flowchart of a process for hybrid cloud monitoring is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The method illustrated in may be implemented for example in data processing environment and using hybrid cloud integrator of or in data processing environment and using hybrid cloud integrator of . The process illustrated in may be used to provide monitoring of data processing resources in a hybrid cloud environment. In this example the hybrid cloud integrator is assumed to be implemented on a consumer side of the hybrid cloud. For example the hybrid cloud integrator may be implemented in a physical server or in a virtual server deployed in the on premise consumer data processing resources on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud.

Hybrid cloud monitoring in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may begin with setting up a hybrid cloud integrator with a cloud service broker cloud security service and cloud monitoring service plug ins step . For example step may include loading the appropriate plug ins into the hybrid cloud integrator framework. In other cases one or more of the appropriate plug ins already may be in place in the hybrid cloud integrator.

The hybrid cloud integrator then may be connected to the network so it can access consumer side data processing resources as well as provider side data processing resources step . The network access may be from inside the consumer network infrastructure and the access to provider side resources may be restricted because of firewalls and proxy servers at the boundary of the consumer side network and external networks including the network where the provider side resources are located.

The hybrid cloud monitoring service in the hybrid cloud integrator then may be configured via the hybrid cloud integrator user interface step . For example step may include configuring the cloud monitoring service on the hybrid cloud integrator as a provider of monitoring data for cloud provided services to a monitoring infrastructure. The monitoring infrastructure may be implemented on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud. Step may include using the hybrid cloud integrator user interface to configure the cloud monitoring service as a new consumer side provider to the monitoring infrastructure. For example this configuration step may include without limitation providing a name description and role for the cloud monitoring service acting as a provider to the monitoring infrastructure. Parameters to be provided as part of the configuration step may include without limitation identification of the host server for the monitoring infrastructure identification of a port for communicating with the monitoring infrastructure identification of an address for the consumer side monitoring gateway that will communicate with the monitoring infrastructure and identification of a protocol for communication between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the monitoring infrastructure.

Step also may include configuring the cloud monitoring service on the hybrid cloud integrator by identifying the service or services to be monitored on the provider side of the hybrid cloud. This step may include creating a new provider side service participant to be monitored. For example this step may include without limitation identifying a name description and role of the cloud service to be monitored. Parameters to be provided at this part of the configuration may include without limitation an end point address and location for the cloud service to be monitored. For example without limitation the end point address may be provided as a universal resource locater address for the cloud service to be monitored.

A provider side monitoring gateway then is established and a provider side monitoring agent is set up configured and started step . The provider side monitoring gateway may be provided on the provider side of a firewall that separates the provider side from the consumer side of a hybrid cloud. For example the provider side of the hybrid cloud may be provided on a public cloud. Step may be implemented using the services of the cloud service broker and the cloud security service. In one example step may include automated instantiation and configuration of the provider side monitoring gateway using the services of the cloud service broker. In another example step may include setting up an existing provider side monitoring gateway for use with the provider side monitoring agent. Step may include receiving via the hybrid cloud integrator a user selection indicating the process to be used to establish the provider side monitoring gateway. Step may include providing configuration parameters for the provider side monitoring gateway to the hybrid cloud integrator via the hybrid cloud integrator user interface. Such configuration parameters may include without limitation identification of a monitoring gateway image to be used to establish the provider side monitoring gateway and an address for the provider side monitoring gateway. For example without limitation the address for the provider side monitoring gateway may be provided as an internet protocol address. In any case the provider side monitoring agent may monitor processing on the provider side of the hybrid cloud and provide resulting monitored data to the provider side monitoring gateway.

A consumer side monitoring gateway is configured and started on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud step . For example step may include implementing the consumer side monitoring gateway by a cloud monitoring service plug in to the hybrid cloud integrator. The consumer side monitoring gateway provides the source of provider side monitoring information to a monitoring infrastructure for monitoring resources on the provider side of the hybrid cloud. Step may include configuring the consumer side monitoring gateway to communicate with the monitoring infrastructure.

A connection between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the monitoring infrastructure is then set up step . The monitoring infrastructure may be implemented in the consumer side data processing system. Thus the monitoring infrastructure may be on the same side of the firewall as the consumer side monitoring gateway. The monitoring infrastructure may be implemented using a number of commercially available products for monitoring the operation of data processing resources. In another embodiment cloud based monitoring services may be used instead of a physical monitoring infrastructure.

A connection between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring gateway is then set up step . The connection between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring gateway may be established as a secure connection through the firewall that separates the consumer side from the provider side of the hybrid cloud.

Connections between monitoring agents on consumer side service instances and the monitoring infrastructure are set up step . The consumer side monitoring agents provide monitoring information related to operation of the consumer side service instances to the monitoring infrastructure. The consumer side monitoring agents may be on the same side of the firewall as the monitoring infrastructure. Therefore the consumer side monitoring agents may be set up to push monitoring information to the monitoring infrastructure as such information is detected or generated by the consumer side monitoring agents.

Connections between monitoring agents on provider side service instances and the provider side monitoring gateway are set up step . The provider side monitoring agents provide monitoring information related to operation of the provider side service instances to the provider side monitoring gateway. For example a monitoring agent may be installed and configured for each of several public cloud service instances to be monitored. Each public cloud side monitoring agent may be configured to monitor desired operating conditions of a public cloud service instance. Each public cloud side monitoring agent is configured to provide monitoring information to the provider side monitoring gateway. The provider side monitoring gateway is configured to receive the monitoring information from the public cloud side monitoring agents. Provisioning resources for the public cloud side monitoring agents and installing and configuring the monitoring agents may be performed remotely using appropriate service deployment component and management integration component plug ins in a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

Monitored data received from the provider side monitoring agents by the provider side gateway is transferred from the provider side monitoring gateway to the consumer side monitoring gateway step . Step may include transferring data through the firewall separating the consumer side from the provider side of the hybrid cloud. Therefore for security reasons step may be implemented by pulling data from the provider side monitoring gateway for transfer to the consumer side monitoring gateway. The provider side monitoring gateway may not be allowed to push data through the firewall to the consumer side of the hybrid cloud. Security of the consumer s data processing resources is maintained in this process since no data is pushed across the firewall from the provider side of the hybrid cloud.

The monitoring information pulled from the provider side gateway may be provided to the monitoring infrastructure via the consumer side gateway. From the point of view of the monitoring infrastructure the consumer side gateway provides monitoring information in the same manner as a consumer side monitoring agent for monitoring data processing resources on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud. With monitoring information for consumer side data processing resources provided by the consumer side monitoring agents and monitoring information for provider side data processing resources provided by the consumer side gateway a monitoring infrastructure is able to monitor simultaneously the operation of data processing resources on both sides of a hybrid cloud.

It may be determined that a new service instance to be monitored has been established on the provider side of the hybrid cloud step . In response to determining that a new service instance has been established a provider side monitoring agent may be started on the new instance and connected to the provider side monitoring gateway step . Step may include provisioning for the new monitoring agent on the provider side of the hybrid cloud and installing and configuring the new monitoring agent on the provider side of the hybrid cloud using the appropriate hybrid cloud integrator plug ins. Step also may include configuring the provider side monitoring gateway to receive monitoring information from the new provider side monitoring agent. For example step may include using the cloud security service plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator to implement security policies that allow for communication between the new provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway. Security policies that allow for communication between the new provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway may be implemented for example by adding the new provider side monitoring agent to the appropriate security zone that also includes the provider side monitoring gateway. The new provider side monitoring agent then may monitor the operation of the new service instance and provide monitoring information to the provider side monitoring gateway for transfer to the monitoring infrastructure via the consumer side monitoring gateway as described above.

It also may be determined that a service instance that was being monitored has been closed or otherwise will not be monitored for some reason step . In response to determining that monitoring of a service instance is to be stopped the monitoring connection to the closed service instance is disconnected step . If the closed service instance is on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud step may include disconnecting the connection between a monitoring agent on the consumer side service instance and the monitoring infrastructure. If the closed service instance is on the provider side of the hybrid cloud step may include closing the connection between the provider side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring agent for the closed instance. Closing the connection between the provider side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring agent for the closed instance may include configuring the provider side monitoring gateway to no longer receive information from the monitoring agent for the closed instance. For example step may include using the cloud security service plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator to implement security policies that prevent further communication between a provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway. Security policies that prevent communication between the provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway may be implemented for example by removing the provider side monitoring agent for the closed instance from the security zone that also includes the provider side monitoring gateway. Step also may include closing the monitoring agent that is no longer needed. Closing the monitoring agent that is no longer needed allows data processing resources that were being used for the closed monitoring agent to be released.

After closing a service instance on the provider side of a hybrid cloud it may be determined that there are no more service instances running on the provider side or otherwise that are to be monitored step . In response to determining that there are no longer any provider side service instances to be monitored the provider side monitoring gateway may be closed step with the process terminating thereafter. Closing the provider side monitoring gateway when there are no longer any provider services to be monitored allows the provider services that were being used for the provider side gateway to be released.

Returning now to step in response to determining that a new service instance has not been established the process proceeds to step to determine that a service instance that was being monitored has been closed or otherwise will not be monitored for some reason. In response to determining that monitoring of a service instance is not to be stopped the process iterates back to step and monitored data is transferred from the provider side monitoring gateway to the consumer side monitoring gateway.

Returning now to step in response to determining that there are provider side service instances to be monitored the process iterates back to step and monitored data is transferred from the provider side monitoring gateway to the consumer side monitoring gateway.

In some cases it may not be desirable to close the provider side monitoring gateway and release the corresponding provider data processing resources immediately when it is determined that there are no remaining provider side service instances to be monitored. For example in some cases it may be expected that monitoring of provider side services will be restarted after only a short intermission. In these cases it may be preferred to keep the provider side gateway in place but inactive even when there are no provider side service instances to be monitored. This allows the provider side monitoring gateway to be restarted quickly when new provider side service instances to be monitored are started. If the provider side monitoring gateway was closed and the corresponding provider side resources released resources would need to be re provisioned for the provider side monitoring gateway on the provider side of the hybrid cloud and the provider side monitoring gateway reinstalled and configured when new provider side service instances to be monitored are started. This process of provisioning installing and configuring a new provider side monitoring gateway would take much longer than restarting a temporarily deactivated gateway.

Referring now to a flowchart of a process for automated provisioning and configuration of a provider side monitoring gateway is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this example the process of is an example of one implementation of steps and of . The process of may be initiated in response to the selection by a user such as an administrator of a hybrid cloud of a process for establishing hybrid cloud monitoring using automated setup and configuration of a provider side monitoring gateway. For example options for the setup and configuration of a provider side monitoring gateway may be presented to the user via a graphical user interface to the hybrid cloud integrator.

Operation of the process to be described here assumes that the parameters of the consumer side monitoring gateway have been established that a system administer has access to the data processing resources on which the provider side monitoring gateway will be established and that a pre built image with a monitoring agent installed and configured as a gateway exists on the provider data processing resources where the provider side monitoring gateway is to be established. In other embodiments the process to be described may be implemented without requiring a pre built image with a monitoring agent installed. In such an embodiment a generic image may be used to provision a virtual machine with a generic operating system such as without limitation SuSE Linux . A monitoring agent may be installed remotely in the virtual machine and configured as a provider side monitoring gateway.

The process of may begin by providing an image identification for a pre built gateway image a user identification and a password to the cloud monitoring service of the hybrid cloud integrator step . The user identification password and image identification may be entered by a user through the hybrid cloud integrator user interface. The image identification may identify a pre built provider side monitoring gateway image in the provider data processing resources that can be used to provision and deploy a cloud side monitoring gateway in the provider data processing environment. The user identification and password may provide access to the provider data processing resources for deploying the provider side monitoring gateway. Typically the user identification and password may belong to the provider of cloud monitoring services or the cloud monitoring administrator on the consumer side of data processing resources.

The cloud service broker then may be invoked to instantiate a provider side monitoring gateway instance from a pre built monitoring gateway image step . For example in step the cloud monitoring service on the hybrid cloud integrator may invoke the cloud service broker to instantiate the gateway instance on the provider data processing resources. Step may be implemented automatically and transparent to the user. The cloud security service on the hybrid cloud integrator then may be invoked to configure the provider side monitoring gateway for authorized and restricted access step .

When the gateway instance on the provider data processing resources is confirmed to be up and running the internet address of the provider side monitoring gateway may be retrieved and used in configuring the consumer side monitoring gateway step . For example without limitation the address of the provider side monitoring gateway may be an internet protocol address. The cloud monitoring service in the hybrid cloud integrator then may start the consumer side monitoring gateway step with the process terminating thereafter. In this example steps and are examples of steps for implementing step in .

Referring now to a flowchart of a process for instantiation and configuration of a provider side monitoring gateway using a cloud service broker is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this example the process of is an example of one implementation of step in . The process of may be initiated under the following assumptions. The hybrid cloud monitoring administrator has necessary credentials to provision a service instance to act as the provider side monitoring gateway on the provider data processing resources. A prebuilt image with a monitoring gateway installed and configured exists and is made available on the provider data processing resources. The service address such as a Uniform Resource Identifier URI for the cloud service broker is known to the monitoring service plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator. When required the administrator may create and provide the necessary public and private key files. These files may be placed in the key vault managed by the cloud security service on the hybrid cloud integrator. Alternatively these key files may be generated automatically.

To begin the process of configuration parameters and attributes of the provider data processing resources on which the provider side monitoring gateway is to be established are used to define the provider data processing resources to the cloud service broker step . These configuration parameters and attributes of the provider data processing resources may have been entered by a user such as a system administrator via the hybrid cloud integrator user interface. This information then may be made available to the cloud service broker in the hybrid cloud integrator.

For example without limitation the hybrid cloud integrator user interface may invoke the cloud service broker with a request of the form 

The cloud service broker then is invoked to instantiate a provider side monitoring gateway instance on the provider data processing resources from a monitoring gateway image step . Prior to step the user such as the system administrator may have configured hybrid cloud monitoring and defined the configuration parameters for hybrid cloud monitoring. These configuration parameters may include parameters for the provider side monitoring gateway and for a consumer side monitoring infrastructure. These configuration parameters may have been entered by the user such as the system administrator via the hybrid cloud user interface. The user interface then may pass the hybrid cloud monitoring configuration parameters to the cloud monitoring service in the hybrid cloud integrator. The cloud monitoring service then may invoke the cloud service broker to instantiate the service instance on the provider data processing resources.

For example the cloud monitoring service on the hybrid cloud integrator may invoke the cloud service broker with a request of the form 

The address of the established provider side monitoring gateway instance then is obtained step . For example the address of the provider side gateway may be an internet protocol address. Step may be implemented by a polling loop that waits and issues the request csb CLOUD NAME listInstance until the returned STATUS moves from PROVISIONING to ACTIVE. When ACTIVE the address of the provider side gateway instance will be returned as part of the listInstance output. The polling loop may cease if STATUS goes from PROVISIONING to FAILED.

Referring now to a flowchart of a process for securing a provider side monitoring gateway via a cloud security service is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process of may be used for example to implement step of .

The process of begins with invoking the cloud security service as the provider side monitoring gateway is instantiated step . For example step may include invoking the cloud security service by the cloud service broker while the provider side monitoring gateway is instantiated. The cloud security service may be implemented as a plug in to the hybrid cloud integrator. The cloud security service may implement the functions of a cloud security zone manager as described above with reference to . For example without limitation step may include a request from the cloud service broker to the cloud security service to process security zoning for the new service instance. This request may be of the form 

The security zone policies from the cloud security service then may be applied to the new service instance to ensure proper isolation step with the process terminating thereafter.

Referring now to a flowchart of a process for accelerated setup of a provider side monitoring gateway is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this example the process of is an example of one implementation of steps and of . The process of may be used when a provider side monitoring gateway is to be provisioned and instantiated on provider side data processing resources. In some situations a provider side monitoring gateway may already be provisioned but hybrid cloud monitoring on the provider data processing resources is not enabled. In such situations the provider data processing resources can be readily monitored using hybrid cloud monitoring by using the already provisioned provider side monitoring gateway. This later process is described in the process of . Thus the process of may be used optionally in place of the process of in some situations. The process of may be initiated in response to the selection by a user of this process for establishing the provider side monitoring gateway from among other options for establishing a provider side monitoring gateway. For example these options may be presented to the user via a graphical user interface to the hybrid cloud integrator.

The process of may be operated based on the following assumptions. The configuration parameters of the consumer side monitoring gateway are already specified. The cloud monitoring administrator has access to the provider data processing resources on which the provider side monitoring gateway is deployed. A service instance has been created on the provider data processing resources and a monitoring gateway has been installed and configured on the service instance as a provider side monitoring gateway.

The process of begins with receiving the address and port of the pre provisioned provider side monitoring gateway step . For example without limitation the address of the pre provisioned monitoring gateway may be an internet protocol address. The address and port of the pre provisioned provider side monitoring gateway may be provided as input by a user such as a system administrator via the hybrid cloud integrator user interface. The provider side monitoring gateway may have been previously configured either automatically or manually by the administrator. The user interface of the hybrid cloud integrator may pass this address and port information to a cloud monitoring service on the hybrid cloud integrator. The cloud monitoring service then may use the address and port of the pre provisioned provider side monitoring gateway to configure the consumer side monitoring gateway and the consumer side monitoring gateway then may be started step with the process terminating thereafter.

Hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment provides a well defined method and apparatus for integrating on premise infrastructure platform applications and data with off premise cloud based infrastructure platform services and data. A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment provides a structured framework of interfaces for hybrid cloud service configuration and deployment of service plug ins. Using these interfaces and application programming interfaces hybrid cloud service plug ins may be defined configured and deployed to create integrated hybrid cloud services.

Hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration capabilities across a hybrid cloud comprising any combination of data processing resources. In one example described in detail herein a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across a hybrid cloud comprising a consumer s private cloud and a provider s pubic cloud. However hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration capabilities for various other types of hybrid clouds. For example a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across a hybrid cloud comprising multiple private clouds. As another example a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across a hybrid cloud comprising multiple public clouds.

Each line of business within a single enterprise may have its own data processing resources implemented as a private cloud. Each such private cloud may have its own point of delivery and point of control. Multiple private clouds of this type may be integrated into a single hybrid cloud and made available to a consumer of data processing resources within the enterprise. A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across such a hybrid cloud. A hybrid cloud formed by integrating private cloud services across multiple private clouds using a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment allows a consumer of resources of one private cloud to consume from the consumer s point of delivery resources and services made available on another private cloud. The hybrid cloud integrator may be configured to allow administrators of each private cloud to manage their clouds from their respective points of control. Hybrid cloud integrator plug in services in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be configured to allow the consumer of data processing resources to enforce the same security monitoring and governance requirements on the consumer s data processing operations performed across the hybrid cloud wherever the consumer s workload is being processed. Thus using a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment workload management may be achieved in a hybrid cloud formed across multiple private clouds.

As another example hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to integrate across a hybrid cloud between two or more public clouds. In this case use of a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment allows a consumer of data processing resources of one public cloud to perform and control consumer data processing operations by coordinating and consuming resources and services from multiple public clouds using a single point of delivery and point of control. Plug in components in the hybrid cloud integrator may be configured to allow the consumer to enforce the same security monitoring and governance requirements on the consumer s data processing operations performed across the hybrid cloud wherever the consumer s workload is being processed. Thus using a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment workload management may be achieved in a hybrid cloud formed across multiple public clouds.
