In particular embodiments a sensors hub may optionally be included in personal computing device . Sensors may be connected to sensors hub which may be a low power consuming processor that controls sensors manages power for sensors processes sensor inputs aggregates sensor data and performs certain sensor functions. In addition in particular embodiments some types of sensors may be connected to a controller . In this case sensors hub may be connected to controller which in turn is connected to sensor . Alternatively in particular embodiments there may be a sensor monitor in place of sensors hub for managing sensors .

In particular embodiments a user may have difficulty inputting a character string such as difficulty inputting a word phrase sentence paragraph address etc. using a touch screen. For example various character strings may be long i.e. they may include many characters have difficult spelling have difficult punctuation may require multiple shifts between various keyboards such as switching from an alphabetical keyboard to a numerical and punctuation keyboard in order to input or may be difficult to input for various other reasons. In order to assist a user with inputting data into a personal computing device traditional personal computing devices may provide a user with a suggestion for a word that the user is attempting to input. For example if a user has input the letters co the personal computing device may suggest the following words code college color company and concert . This may allow the user to select one of these words to complete their input. Unfortunately in many circumstances the suggestion may be burdensome to the user. For example when a user is entering a word that is easy for the user to successfully complete on their own such as for example the word code it may be burdensome to the user to deal with such suggestions such as to cancel the suggestion or search through the suggestions to find the correct word when it may have been much easier for the user to just finish inputting the word without the suggestion.

According to one aspect of the disclosed subject matter a personal computing device can provide for display to a user an auto suggestion for completing a character string being input by the user. Furthermore in particular embodiments such an auto suggestion for completing the character string may only be provided if a degree of difficulty of the user entering the character string exceeds a pre determined threshold or is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold . For example if the user is inputting the character string code personal computing device may determine that the degree of difficulty associated with the user s input of each character of the word does not exceed a pre determined threshold or is not approximately equal to the pre determined threshold and therefore personal computer device may not provide an auto suggestion for completing the character string. As such the user may not be burdened by an auto suggestion when it is not needed. On the other hand if the user is entering the character string The address of the White House is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington D.C. 20500. personal computing device may determine at some point during the user s entry of this character string that the degree of difficulty of the user entering the character string exceeds a pre determined threshold or is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold . As such personal computing device may provide an auto suggestion for completing this character string helping the user complete the character string.

At step a degree of difficulty of the user entering the character string is determined. The degree of difficulty may be determined in any suitable manner. For example the degree of difficulty of the user entering the character string may be based at least in part on a length of the character string such as how many characters have already been entered by the user a number of keyboard shifts associated with entering the character string such as how many times the user has switched between various keyboards while entering the character string a number of special characters in the character string such as the number of punctuations accented characters or other special characters that have already been input by the user a number of capitalizations in the character string such as the number of times a user has already capitalized a character while inputting the character string an amount of time associated with entering the character string such as if the user has already spent for example 23 seconds inputting the characters an amount of time associated with entering subsequent characters of the character string such as if the user has already spent for example 10 seconds between inputting the previous character and the next character a keyboard positional distance between input characters of the character string such as if one of the characters input by the user is in the top left corner of the keyboard while another character is in the bottom right corner of the keyboard any other indication of input difficulty or any combination of the preceding.

In particular embodiments in order to determine the degree of difficulty a weighted factor may be applied to one or more of the indications of input difficulty of a character string. For example the length of the character string may be weighted lower than for example the amount of time associated with entering the character string. In such an example a character string may be determined to have a high degree of difficulty when the length of the input is only five characters but the user has spent 23 seconds inputting these five characters. The weighting of the indications of input difficulty may be determined in any suitable manner. For example a user of personal computing device may determine how much weight should be given to particular indications. As another example the weighting factors may be determined by the manufacturer and or developer of personal computing device . In such an example the user may be able to change the default weighting factors set by the manufacturer and or developer. In particular embodiments the degree of difficulty of the user entering the character string may include any type of expression difficulty. For example the degree of difficulty may be expressed as one or more of the indications of difficulty such as the user having already spent for example 23 seconds inputting the character string a value such as 8.5 out of 10.0 a letter grade such as B a grouping such as high low and or medium any other suitable expression or any combination of the preceding.

At step a determination is made regarding whether the degree of difficulty is approximately equal to or exceeds a pre determined threshold. If the degree of difficulty is not approximately equal to the pre determined threshold or does not exceed the pre determined threshold the method moves to step where the method ends. On the other hand if the degree of difficulty is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold or does exceed the pre determined threshold the method moves to step discussed below .

The pre determined threshold may include any type of expression of a threshold. For example the pre determined threshold may be expressed as one or more of the indications of input difficulty such as the user being allocated for example 25 seconds to input a character string a value such as 7.3 out of 10.0 a letter grade such as B a grouping such as high any other suitable expression or any combination of the preceding. In particular embodiments the pre determined threshold may be determined in any suitable manner. For example a user of personal computing device may determine the threshold. In such an example the user may be allowed to select a threshold for which the user desires to receive auto suggestions. As another example the threshold may be determined by the manufacturer and or developer of personal computing device . In such an example the threshold may be based on data regarding what a typical user will find difficult to input such as data indicating for example that a typical user is having difficulty if the input has taken longer than 20 seconds . In particular embodiments the user may be able to change the default threshold set by the manufacturer and or developer. As a further example the pre determined threshold may be pre determined based on the user and or the platform utilized by the user. In such an example personal computing device may utilize previous inputs by the user to determine using for example machine learning the pre determined threshold. In particular if the user typically inputs character strings within 10 seconds personal computing device may set the pre determined threshold for the user at 9 seconds.

In particular embodiments whether the degree of difficulty exceeds the pre determined threshold or is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold may be determined based on comparing the degree of difficulty to the pre determined threshold. In particular embodiments the degree of difficulty may be determined to be approximately equal to the pre determined threshold when the degree of difficulty is within a rate of error of the pre determined threshold. For example if the pre determined threshold is a number such as 7.5 the degree of difficulty may be approximately equal to 7.5 when it is within 1 2 of 7.5. In particular embodiments the rate of error may include a rate of error for determining the degree of difficulty.

At step an auto suggestion for completing the character string is provided for display to the user. In particular embodiments completing a character string may include any suitable manner of providing one or more characters to the character string in order to complete the character string. For example completing a character string for the user may include correcting spelling in the character string such as correcting the spelling of helo to hello correcting grammar in the character string such as changing I lie the pencil on the table to I lay the pencil on the table correcting punctuation in the character string such as adding a period to the end of a sentence completing a word such as completing the entry colo to be color completing a phrase such as completing the entry as soon as p to be as soon as possible completing a sentence such as completing the entry The address of the White House is to be The address of the White House is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington D.C. 20500. replacing a word such as replacing the word there with the word their replacing a number such as replacing the number 53 with the number 35 any other manner of completing the character string or any combination of the preceding.

The auto suggestion to be provided for display to the user may be determined by personal computing device in any suitable manner. As a first example the auto suggestion may be determined based on a typeahead process. In such an example a typeahead process may work alone or in conjunction with one or more backend server side typeahead processes executing at or within the social networking system to interactively and virtually instantaneously as appearing to the user provide an auto suggestion determined to be the most relevant or best match to the characters entered by the user as the user enters the characters. The typeahead processes may for example utilize social graph information in social networking system including information associated with nodes as well as edges information about the user entering the text including information entered in the user s profile page information about the users friends information about other nodes the user is connected with etc. and or one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify character strings to provide as an auto suggestion. Further information regarding typeahead processes is included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 631 489 filed on Sep. 28 2012 and entitled Enhanced Predictive Input Utilizing a Typeahead Process which in incorporated herein by reference.

As a second example the auto suggestion may be determined based on a customized dictionary associated with the user. In particular embodiments a customized dictionary may be a dictionary constructed for individual users or groups of users or for different communication channels. Words are collected from texts submitted by electronic device users through various communication channels. The usage of these words are analyzed for different communication categories and for each communication category the words are sorted based on their respective usage frequencies in that communication category. Electronic dictionaries are constructed by blending some of the frequently used words in at least some of the communication categories. Different dictionaries may be constructed by blending the words differently. In some implementations the customized dictionary may be selected based on factors such as for example and without limitation the type of electronic device used by the user to input the text the recipients for receiving the inputted text and the form of communication embodied by the inputted text. Further information regarding customized dictionaries is included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 396 559 filed on Feb. 14 2012 and entitled User Experience with Customized User Dictionary which in incorporated herein by reference.

As a third example the auto suggestion may be determined based on a social context of a communication session in which the user is involved. In particular embodiments a communications session may include any communications session. For example a communications session may include an e mail sent from the user a Short Message Service SMS message sent from the user an Instant Messaging IM session involving the user a post by the user to a profile page of another user such as the user posting to the profile page of one of the user s friends a comment by the user on content associated with another user such as a comment by the user about a picture uploaded by one of the user s friends any other type of communication by the user or any combination of the preceding. In particular embodiments the communication session may be between the user and one or more additional users. For example the communication session may be between the user and one or more of the user s friends. In particular embodiments social context of the communication session may include information about one or more circumstances of the communication session. For example the social context may include a previous communication between the user and other users such as a previous communication between the user and a user s friend a relationship of the user to other users such as whether the user is related to the other user computing devices being used by the user or other users such as the identity or type of computing devices being used software applications being used by the user or the other users such as if the user and the user s friend are communicating while playing a particular game such as chess subject matter of the communication session such as if the user is communicating using acronyms any other social context or any combination of the preceding.

Once an auto suggestion for completing the character string is provided for display to the user the method moves to step . At step the method ends.

While the method of illustrates the method ending if it is determined that the degree of difficulty does not exceed the pre determined threshold or is not approximately equal to the pre determined threshold in particular embodiments the method may instead move back to step where one or more characters of the character string are received. In such embodiments if the characters input by the user are initially determined to have a degree of difficulty that does not exceed the pre determined threshold or is not approximately equal to the pre determined threshold the method may allow the user to keep entering characters. Therefore if the entry is later determined to have a degree of difficulty that exceeds the pre determined threshold or is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold personal computing device may then provide an auto suggestion for completing the character string. As an example when the user has only entered the characters co personal computing device may determine that the degree of difficulty of such an entry may not exceed the pre determined threshold or may not be approximately equal to the pre determined threshold . However when the user has entered collocui personal computing device may determine that the degree of difficulty now exceeds the pre determined threshold or is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold and may auto suggest the word colloquium and or colloquialism .

Additionally while the method of illustrates that the degree of difficulty for the user entering the character string is determined based at least in part on what has already been input by the user such as how many characters have already been entered by the user how many times the user has switched between various keyboards while entering the character string etc. in particular embodiments the degree of difficulty may also be determined based on the completed character string. For example while the user is inputting data personal computing device may already be determining the auto suggestions for completing the character string even though these auto suggestions may not be provided for display to the user . In such an example personal computing device may further determine whether the degree of difficulty of completing the character string would exceed the pre determined threshold or be approximately equal to the pre determined threshold . If it would personal computing device may provide the auto suggestions for display to the user even if the degree of difficulty of what has already been input by the user is not yet approximately equal to the pre determined threshold or does not yet exceed the pre determined threshold .

Furthermore while the method of is illustrated as providing an auto suggestion for completing the character string when it is determined that the degree of difficulty exceeds the pre determined threshold or is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold in a particular embodiments personal computing device may further add the character string to the user s custom dictionary when a degree of difficulty exceeds the pre determined threshold or is approximately equal to the pre determined threshold . For example if a user s inputs I love the movie Singing In personal computing device may determine that the degree of difficulty of such an input exceeds the pre determined threshold and therefore may auto suggest the sentence I love the movie Singing In The Rain. Furthermore based on the determination that the degree of difficulty exceeds the pre determined threshold personal computing device may also add this character string or a portion of this character string such as just Singing In The Rain to the user s custom dictionary.
