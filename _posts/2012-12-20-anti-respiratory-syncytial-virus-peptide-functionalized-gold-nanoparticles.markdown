Human respiratory syncytial virus RSV belongs to the Pneumovirus subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family with a negative single strand RNA genome and enveloped nucleocapsid Respiratory Syncytial Virus Human Paramyxoviridae Encyclopedia of Virology Second Edition G. Allan and G. W. Robert Eds Oxford Elsevier pp. 1479 1487 . RSV is the leading cause of pediatric bronchiolitis pneumonia and bronchitis worldwide and is also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly.

RSV infects adults as well as infants and children. In healthy adults RSV causes predominantly upper respiratory tract disease. It has recently become evident that some adults especially the elderly have symptomatic RSV infections more frequently than had been previously reported Evans A. S. eds. 1989 Viral Infections of Humans. Epidemiology and Control 3.sup.rd ed. Plenum Medical Book New York at pages 525 544 . Several epidemics also have been reported among nursing home patients and institutionalized young adults Falsey A. R. 1991 Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 12 602 608 and Garvie et al. 1980 Br. Med. J. 281 1253 1254 . RSV also may cause serious disease in immunosuppressed persons particularly bone marrow transplant patients Hertz et al. 1989 Medicine 68 269 281 .

Viral and host factors in human RSV pathogenesis are known J Virol 82 5 2040 2055 . Two glycoproteins F and G on the surface of RSV have been shown to be targets of neutralizing antibodies Fields et al. 1990 supra and Murphy et al. 1994 supra . These two proteins are also primarily responsible for viral recognition and entry into target cells G protein binds to a specific cellular receptor and the F protein promotes fusion of the virus with the cell. The F protein is also expressed on the surface of infected cells and is responsible for subsequent fusion with other cells leading to syncytia formation. Thus antibodies to the F protein or other inhibitors of the F protein may directly neutralize virus or block entry of the virus into the cell or prevent syncytia formation. However the manufacturing of antibodies is very expensive and the amount of antibody that can be purified and concentrated is limited. To date no effective vaccine has been developed against RSV due to the lack of suitable animal models and to various immunological obstacles Crowe Jr J. E. 2001 Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development Vaccine 20 Supplement 1 0 S32 S37 . Effective therapeutics and methodologies to eliminate human RSV infection at an early stage are needed. In addition there is a need to inhibit the fusion process in order to proactively prevent an RSV infection.

While the following description details the preferred embodiments of the present invention it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and arrangement of the parts illustrated in the accompanying figures since the invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced in various ways.

The peptides of the present invention are derived from peptide sequences identified in the human RSV fusion protein precursor F0. F0 is the precursor protein that is cleaved at two furin cleavage sites to yield the fully functional F1 F2 disulfide linked dimer. Heptad repeats HR1 and HR2 form alpha helical structures critical for completing membrane fusion. The RSV fusion protein precursor F0 is cleaved twice releasing a 27 amino acid peptide and the F1 and F2 proteins which are covalently linked by two disulfide bonds. The F1 protein is anchored in the membrane by the transmembrane domain. This cleavage activates the fusion ability of the F protein by releasing the highly hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N terminus of F1 see U.S. Pat. No. 7 700 720 .

Nanotechnology has opened up ways to develop newer methods for diagnostics and therapy. Nanoparticles range in size from 1 100 nm and are available in a wide array of materials. Amongst these the most commonly used nanoparticles include metallic nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles are one of the most preferred nanoparticles due to their physiochemical properties Tiwari P. et al. 2011 Nanomaterials 1 1 31 63 . Gold nanoparticles have been widely studied due to their functionalization capabilities that is conjugation with various biomolecules including peptides proteins nucleic acids or antibodies. The peptide functionalized gold nanoparticles have gained wide applications for intracellular targeting Patel P. C. D. A. Giljohann et al. 2008 PNAS 105 45 17222 17226 . It is known that gold nanoparticles can be coated with a self assembled monolayer of compounds containing carboxylic functions. However these types of gold nanoparticles are known to be useful only for fixing directly to keratin fibers such as human hair see U.S. Pat. No. 7 186 274 .

Peptides RF482 and RF491 were also synthesized with an N terminal addition of 2 amino ethoxy ethoxy acetic acid H AEEAc by Bachem Americas Inc. The chemical structure of H AEEAc is 

The carboxylated gold nanoparticles were conjugated with H AEEAc RF482 or H AEEAc RF491. All of the components were brought to room temperature. A stock aqueous solution was made of water and carboxylated gold nanoparticles at a concentration of 862 nM relative to the content of gold salts. Stock aqueous solutions were made of the H AEEAc peptides 229 M 1 mg ml in water for H AEEAc RF482 peptide and 439 M 1 mg ml in water for H AEEAc RF491 peptide. 5 ml of a 5 nM concentration of the carboxylated gold nanoparticle solution was placed in a tube and vortexed for 5 seconds. Then a H AEEAc peptide 390 l of RF 482 or 207 l of RF491 was added to these carboxylated gold nanoparticles to give a final H AEEAc peptide concentration of 17 M. This mixture of carboxylated gold nanoparticles and H AEEAc peptide was then vortexed for about 1 minute. After this 25 l of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide EDC solution 2 mg ml in water preferably deionized water was immediately added to this mixture with stirring thereby conjugating the H AEEAc peptide to the carboxylated gold nanoparticles. 6 to 10 peptide molecules were conjugated to each carboxylated gold nanoparticle. This mixture was then vortexed for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14 000 rpm for 45 minutes to obtain a pellet. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was suspended in 5 mL of water preferably sterile deionized water. Preferably this process was repeated twice. The final pellet was resuspended in 5 mL of water preferably sterile deionized water and sonicated. The carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with the anti RSV peptide were then used for RSV inhibition experiments. Carboxylated gold nanoparticles alone i.e. with no peptides or any other substances conjugated thereto were used as a control solution. In addition the carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with the RF 482 peptide and the carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with the RF 491 peptide were mixed preferably in an equimolar ratio 4 nM final concentration and were also used for RSV inhibition experiments.

To ensure successful conjugation of the peptides to the carboxylated gold nanoparticles UV Vis spectra was recorded from 450 550 nm. Shift in the surface plasmon resonance SPR was used as a measure of conjugation of gold nanoparticles. The results of the UV Vis spectral analysis are shown in wherein carboxylated gold nanoparticles are abbreviated as GNP.

Further confirmation of conjugation of the peptides to the carboxylated gold nanoparticles was performed by transmission electron microscopy TEM . The results are shown in . A bright hallow of peptide can be observed around the gold nanoparticles when conjugated with the peptide s . The carboxylated gold nanoparticles remain spherical after conjugation.

The peptides and carboxylated gold nanoparticles were tested for cytotoxic effects on human epidermoid cancer HEp 2 cells. Cell viability was assessed by measuring cell concentration of a tetrazolium salt 3 4 5 dimethyl 2 yl 5 3 carboxy methoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl 2H tetrazolium MTT . If cells are viable the mitochondria will reduce the MTT. The cells were grown overnight in minimal essential medium MEM supplemented with L glutamine Penicillin streptomycin and kanamycin. 2.7 105 cells well in 100 l were seeded into 96 well plates in MEM. Cells were allowed to grow overnight in an incubator at 37 C. with a 5 COhumidified atmosphere until the carboxylated gold nanoparticles were added. After overnight incubation media from the 96 well plates were replaced with the serial dilutions of RF482 RF491 carboxylated gold nanoparticles GNP carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with RF482 GNP RF482 or carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with RF491 GNP RF491 in MEM 10. Treated cells were further incubated at 37 C. 5 COfor 24 and 48 hours. At the end of the corresponding incubation time 15 l of MTT dye was added into each well and the plates were allowed to incubate for the next 4 hours in the dark. The reaction was then stopped with 100 l of stop solution. The absorbance of the media was measured at 570 nm on a TECAN Sunrise enzyme linked immunosorbent assay plate reader TECAN US Inc. Durham N.C. USA . Non treated cells in growth media were used as a control. The results with the RF482 and RF491 peptides are shown in and . The peptides had no significant effect on cell viability at concentrations up to 50 g ml. The effects of carboxylated gold nanoparticles are shown in and . The carboxylated gold nanoparticles alone GNP had no significant effect on cell viability at concentrations up to 1 nM. Carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with RF482 GNP RF482 reduced cell viability about 30 at concentrations up to 1 nM. Carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with RF491 GNP RF491 reduced cell viability about 40 at concentrations up to 1 nM.

The peptides and carboxylated gold nanoparticles were tested for inhibition antifusogenic activity of RSV infection in HEp 2 cells. HEp 2 cells were grown in MEM in 12 well plates. 100 plaque forming Units PFUs of RSV mixed with 1 RF482 2 RF491 3 RF482 RF491 4 carboxylated gold nanoparticles GNP 5 carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with RF482 GNP RF482 6 carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with RF491 GNP RF491 or 7 a mixture of carboxylated gold nanoparticles conjugated with RF491 and RF492 GNP RF482 GNP RF491 were made up to a final volume of 100 l with MEM and incubated at RT for 30 minutes. Final concentrations of the peptides used were 50 M 25 M 12.5 M 6.25 M and 3.125 M. The concentration of carboxylated gold nanoparticles ranged from 0.125 nM to 4 nM. The mixtures were assessed for viral titers. The mixtures were then added to HEp 2 cells maintained in 12 well plates. After incubating the cells with RSV for an hour at 37 C. methylcellulose overlay containing DMEM Dulbecco s Minimal Essential Medium and FBS Fetal Bovine Serum 2 volume volume was added to cells to maintain the virus number in the overlay and incubated for 72 hours. At the end of the incubation period the methylcellulose layer was removed and cell monolayer was stained with crystal violet for the enumeration of the RSV plaques. Results were expressed in plaque forming units PFUs ml. The results for inhibition antifusogenic activity of RSV infection are shown in and . RF482 and RF482 RF491 reduced plaque counts by about 80 to 90 at 50 M concentrations. RF491 was not effective in reducing plaque counts. The carboxylated gold nanoparticles alone or conjugated with the peptides reduced plaque counts by about 75 to 85 at 4 nM concentrations.
