In recent years some educational and professional systems have been moving toward performance pay which provides that a portion of a professional s compensation may be tied to performance. However these systems are often limited in managing and monitoring the professional development of these professionals. For example current systems often lack online tools for professionals to use to plan their professional development create and share portfolios of their accomplishments or to easily report their progress on various development plans to their administrators. These systems are also generally limited in providing administrators with the ability to direct the professional development of those users that they oversee. For example these systems often do not provide administrators with the ability to set and monitor specific goals and tasks for those users and follow up and to provide feedback on those goals and tasks to those users.

According to one innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure a system may include one or more processors a plan management module and an achievement module. The plan management module is executable by the one or more processors to receive data representing a development plan for one or more users. The achievement module is executable by the one or more processors to determine one or more achievements associated with the development plan to provide the one or more achievements to a user device of a first user to receive an association of an achievement selected from the one or more achievements with the goal related aspect of the development plan and to associate the achievement with the goal related aspect of the development plan. The achievement module is coupled to the plan management module or a data store to receive the data representing the development plan.

In general another innovative aspect of the subject matter described in this disclosure may be embodied in a method performed by one or more computing devices that includes receiving a development plan for one or more users the development plan including a goal related aspect associated with a profession determining one or more achievements associated with the development plan providing the one or more achievements to a user device of a first user receiving an association of an achievement selected from the one or more achievements with the goal related aspect of the development plan and associating the achievement with the goal related aspect of the development plan.

Other implementations of one or more of these aspects include corresponding systems apparatus and computer programs configured to perform the actions of the methods encoded on computer storage devices.

These and other implementations may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For example the operations may include generating based on associating the achievement with the goal related aspect a report describing the progress of the first user on the development plan providing the report to the user device of the first user or a user device of a second user that is an administrator of the first user for presentation using the one or more computing devices receiving an assignment of the development plan from a second user that is an administrator of the first user assigning the development plan to the first user for completion receiving feedback from a second user regarding one or more of the goal related aspect and the achievement the second user being an administrator of the first user providing the feedback from the second user to the first user receiving a revision to the development plan based on providing the feedback providing a listing of one or more training resources to a user device of a second user that is an administrator of the first user providing a listing of one or more professionals including the first user to the user device of the second user that data representing the development plan includes an assignment of a training resource to the first user for completion the data representing the development plan is received from the second user assigning the development plan to the first user for completion determining an assignment for the first user included in the development plan determining a status for the assignment the status describing whether the assignment has been completed by the first user generating a report including the status providing the report to a second user for review the second user being an administrator of the first user determining the assignment to be complete and automatically facilitating provision of a continuing education credit to the first user based on determining the assignment to be complete.

The method may continue by the achievement module providing the achievement data to the professional development application for display to the user . Next the plan management module may receive association data from the professional development application describing the association of a task and or item with a goal of the development plan and the plan management module may associate the task and or item with one or more goal related aspects e.g. goals actions tasks etc. of the development plan. In some embodiments the plan management module associates the task and or item with the one or more aspects of the development plan by updating annotating the development plan data stored in the data store to reflect the association of the task and or item with the aspect. In some embodiments blocks and may be omitted and the method may automatically determine and associate the achievements of the user with aspect s e.g. required task s of the development plan. For example the user may have performed an activity e.g. viewed an online training video created and uploaded a lesson plan etc. via the professional development engine and or management engine and the achievement module may automatically determine the performance of the activity as an achievement by referencing the record of the activity in the data store and associating it with a required task of the development plan in the data store .

The method may continue by the reporting module generating a report describing the status of the development plan and providing the report to one or more recipients. In some embodiments the report is generated based at least in part on the reporting module receiving a report instruction. The report instruction may be automatically generated by the management engine the professional development application engine or another source or the instruction may be generated and sent by the professional development application via the network . For example a user may provide input instructing a report be generated by the reporting module using a user interface provided by the professional development application and the professional development application may generate the report instruction and transmit it to the reporting module for execution. The method may then provide the report to one or more recipients. The recipients and or the mechanism for providing the report may be defined by the report instruction or may be predefined as a setting stored as data in the data store . In some embodiments the report is provided to one or more recipients via electronic message e.g. email SMS MMS message etc. as a dataset e.g. webpage HTML XML JSON PDF etc. configured to be rendered and displayed to the user via the professional development application or any other means for communicating information electronically. The recipient s may include the user who requested the report user s specified by the requestor user such as an administrator of the requestor user . The report may be transmitted to the professional development application for display to the designated recipient s or for saving and or further distribution by the recipient s . The method is then complete and ends.

The method begins by receiving the development plan as previously described above with reference to at least block . Next the method continues by the plan management module optionally assigning the development plan to one or more other users . In some embodiments assignment data is included with the development plan data received from the professional development application describing which users the plan should be associated with. In other embodiments assignment data describing the users that the plan should be associated with is stored and accessed from the data store . Additional description of an example embodiment for assigning the development plan is discussed below with reference to at least . In the foregoing embodiments the plan management module may annotate the development plan data with the assignment data e.g. in the data store to memorialize the assignment of the development plan to the users . In some embodiments block may be optional because assignment data might not be included with the development plan data or stored in the data store since a user may create his or her own a development plan or an administrator user may elect not to assign a development plan.

The method continues by performing the functions described above with reference to at least blocks and . Next the plan management module may receive one or more associations and or development plan revisions. In some embodiments an association i.e. association of a user achievement with a goal action task etc. included in the development plan is received in the form of association data and a development plan revision i.e. revision addition to the development plan is received in the form of revised or iterative development plan data. For each association received the plan management module can modify annotate the development plan data to reflect that association of a user achievement with an aspect e.g. goal action task etc. of the development plan as previously described above with reference to at least block . For each development plan revision received the plan management module can modify annotate the development plan data to reflect the revision e.g. addition or modification of a goal to the development plan.

Next the method can determine whether there are additional associations or revisions to the development plan. If the method determines that there are additional associations or revisions to the data plan then it may return back to blocks and to process them respectively. Otherwise the method may continue by the reporting module receiving a report request. The report request may be a report instruction generated and provided by any of the entities of system e.g. to the reporting module or may be self generated by the reporting module . The report instruction may define the scope content and or recipients of the report to be generated or may simply be instruction to generate the report. Upon receiving the report instruction the reporting module may generate and provide the report as previously described above with reference to at least blocks and . The method is then complete and ends.

The method may begin by receiving a development plan creation request from an administrator user . In some embodiments the plan management module may receive the development plan creation request. In other embodiments another component of the management engine or the professional development application engine such as a discrete controller or request handler may receive the request and relay it to the plan management module .

Responsive to receiving the development plan creation request the method may provide a listing of training resource s to the administrator. In some embodiments the plan management module may retrieve the listing of training resource s from the data store or the professional development application engine e.g. via an API a procedure call etc. and provide the listing of training resource s by transmitting it to a user device of the administrator. In some embodiments the administrator may in cooperation with the professional development application and or the professional development application engine instruct which training resource s should be provided by indicating a category or resource type in the request may search for and or filter the listing of training resources etc. to narrow the listing of training resources to his her preferences.

The method may also provide a listing of professional s to the administrator. In some embodiments the professional s may be individuals that report to the administrator or that the administrator has responsibility for. For example in an educational environment the administrator may be a principal or an assistant principal and the professional s may be teachers. In a further example the administrator may be a district supervisor and the professional s may include one or more of principals assistant principals staff teachers etc. In some embodiments the plan management module may query the data store for the listing of professional s and may provide them by transmitting them to a user device of the administrator for presentation.

Responsive to providing the listing of training resource s and or professional s the administrator the method may receive a development plan including one or more assignments of one or more training resources to one or more professionals. In some embodiments the development plan may include one or more goals that have one or more required tasks associated with them and the tasks may be assigned to the one or more professionals for completion. In these embodiments the required task may have one or more criteria associated with them that define the manner in which the task should be completed including for example any due dates what evidence should be submitted demonstrating the performance of the task e.g. certification work product etc. . The method can then assign the development plan to the one or more professionals. In some embodiments the plan management module assigns a development plan by associating it with the one or more professionals in the data store . By virtue of assigning the development plan any required tasks included in the development plan along with any criteria governing the completion of those tasks may be associated with assigned to the one or more professionals e.g. in the data store . The method is then complete and ends.

Automating the creation and assignment of goal related tasks to professionals by an administrator as provided by way of example in method carries numerous benefits. For example in an educational environment allows an administrator to easily define organization wide goals for professionals to strive for as well as specific action items that must be completed by those professionals in attaining those goals. Moreover the reporting functionality described elsewhere herein provides the administrator with real time immediate access to reports that describe how the professionals are progressing relative to the aspects of the development plan. In another example it allows an administrator to set specific goals and tasks on an individualized basis to help facilitate growth and development among certain professionals. For example in an educational environment a certain teacher may be struggling with one or more aspects of his or her job related functions and the administrator may efficiently and effectively define a development plan that includes required tasks for this teacher to perform in order to improve and ultimately become a more effective teacher. It should be understood that the foregoing examples are not exhaustive that numerous other benefits are contemplated and encompassed by the scope of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments the development plan may include one or more required and or optional goal related assignments e.g. tasks activities etc. for the user s to complete and the method may begin by the reporting module determining what assignment s the development plan includes and then determining whether the assignment s have been completed by the user s . As discussed elsewhere herein the assignment s may be self assigned or assigned by another user such as an administrator. In some embodiments the user s achievements may be associated with the assignment s in the data store as evidence of their completion as discussed above with reference to at least methods and and the reporting module may determine whether the assignment s are complete or incomplete based on this association data. In other embodiments the reporting module may independently compare the assignment s to the user s achievements videos watched electronic books read evidence uploaded etc. to determine whether the assignments have been completed. In some instances the reporting module may compare the achievement s to the assignment criteria e.g. due dates level of completion required etc. to determine whether assignment s have been completed.

By way of further example an assignment may require that the user watch a particular online training video or series of online training videos to completion within a certain timeframe. The user may access and watch the assigned video s via the professional development application and while doing so the professional development application may transmit event data describing what video s were watched if the video s were watched to completion and the date time the video s were watched to the professional development application engine . The professional development application engine may store the event data in the data store and the achievement module can compare the event data to the assignment criteria to determine if the assignment has been completed by the user and store achievement data reflecting such in the data store for use by the reporting module when determining if the assignment has been completed. In other examples the reporting module may perform the comparison of event data to assignment criteria to determine if the assignment has been completed by the user.

In some embodiments the plan management module may determine whether the development plan is associated with a continuing education credit and if so whether all the requirements of the continuing education credit have been satisfied by the completed assignments included in the development plan. If all of the requirements of the continuing education credit have been satisfied the plan management module may automatically facilitate provision of the continuing education credit to the professional. For example the third party server or the professional development application engine may include software routines for managing continuing education credits units for various certification bodies professional societies government boards etc. including for example tracking the number of credits the users have completed determining whether sufficient credits have been completed to maintain licensure accreditation etc. The plan management module may facilitate provision of the continuing education credit by interacting with these entities e.g. via APIs procedure calls etc. . For example the plan management module may securely transmit credit data evidencing the completion of the credit by one or more user s to the third party server or the professional development application engine and these entities may provide the credit to the user s based on the credit data. The blocks and are depicted in hashed lines to illustrate that the operations of these blocks may in some cases not apply and may be omitted.

The method may continue by the reporting module determining any other accomplishments achieved by the user that are included in the development plan generating a report. In some embodiments the report may describe the how one or more users are progressing on the development plan as discussed elsewhere herein. For example the report may include a summary of the items that have been completed and or not completed by the user s as well as other achievements achieved by the user s etc. Upon generating a report the reporting module may provide the report for presentation. In some embodiments the report may be provided via the network for presentation to each user to which the development plan applies. In some embodiments the report may be provided via the network for presentation to an administrator of the user or users to which the development plan applies. The report may be presented to a user via the professional development application a messaging application or other applicable software operable by the user s user device . The method is then complete and ends.

For existing development plans the professional development application may populate the first region with development plan data retrieved from the plan management module and the user may add to or revise the development plan data using the editing functionality of the first region. The user interface may also include an edit button configured to initialize the user interface see and a delete button for deleting the selected development plan in its entirety. In some embodiments the user interface may include an indicator that indicates whether the highlighted aspect of the development plan is required or optional. For example the development plan may be one assigned by the user s administrator and may include one or more items that the user is required to complete e.g. watching three time management videos . For these items the user interface may include an indicator indicating that the task is required.

In some embodiments the user interface may include feedback functionality. For example the user interface may include a feedback region that displays comments input by one or more users e.g. the target user an administrator e.g. manager principal reviewer etc. regarding one or more aspects of the development plan. For instance in the depicted embodiment a principal has input a comment regarding the video watched by the user and associated with the education related action item of watching three time management videos. The feedback region may include a reply button for responding to the comment. For example selecting the reply button may display a text box for inputting the reply and a submit button for submitting it. In some embodiments the feedback region may include an add comment button for adding a separate comment related to the highlighted element of the development plan e.g. video . The feedback input and submitted by the user may be provided by the professional development application to the plan management module as development plan data for storage and later access and provision to the user or other users such as an administrator user . The feedback region is advantageous as it can facilitate a real time dialog between a user and his her administrator regarding the development plan and thereby enable the users to ask questions and provide and receive feedback on the development plan e.g. answers to questions encouragement constructive criticism etc. . This feedback loop can produce a higher level of engagement and interest among users on their professional development and ultimately yield more effective professionals.

As depicted in the achievement selector may be a dropdown menu including options to select video observations courses journal entries file uploads links reflection questions and generic tasks items that the users has completed. When an option from the dropdown menu is selected the professional development application can populate the content region below the dropdown menu depicted in with corresponding tasks or items completed or provided by the user . For example when Videos is selected in the drop down menu the content region below the dropdown menu may be populated by the professional development application with the videos that the user has watched e.g. to completion using the functionality provided by the professional development application engine in cooperation with the professional development application . In some embodiments if a user has not yet watched a video that is required to be watched by a goal of the development plan the user may stream the video for watching using an instance of a video player not shown embedded in a top region of the user interface . In some embodiments once the video has been played to completion by the user the embedded video player provides a signal of such to the professional development application engine and the professional development application refreshes the content region below the dropdown menu with updated achievement data from the achievement module reflecting that the video has been watched and is available to be associated with a goal folder of the development plan as further described below.

In some embodiments the second region may include a generic task addition button labeled Add New Generic Type which when selected may instruct the professional development application to render and display the user interface . The user interface is an example interface for adding additional goal related items such as a generic item. In particular the user interface may provide interface elements for defining the generic task such as a text boxes for inputting the title and a short description of the task. The functionality to add generic tasks is advantageous because it can allow a user to provide evidence a record for completed task that falls outside of the predefined categories of items task provided by the drop down menu such as videos etc.

In some embodiments the generic items can be further displayed refined by category including for example conferences workshops and seminars attended other tasks completed and action undertaken. The generic items may also be coupled associated with an uploaded file using a file addition dialog functionality provided via the second region see or the user interface to present a more complete picture summary of the activity or task that was completed and both the uploaded file and generic item may be added to the development plan as evidence that a goal was accomplished as further described below. In other embodiments as depicted in an uploaded file may be added using the file upload dialog initialized by a new file button of the user interface . The uploaded file may be added for selection as evidence of a completed task for example a document establishing attendance of a conference a document containing a lesson plan created by the user etc. In the foregoing embodiments once a file and or generic item is added using the elements and the professional development application may send data describing the file and or generic item to the achievement module for storage in the data store as achievement data and for later retrieval during a subsequent viewing and revision of the development plan generation of a report etc.

While is described in the context of associating a completed video task with the development plan the above described functionality may apply to any task configured by the user and or described by the achievement data. In some embodiments when a user associates a completed task with a corresponding aspect e.g. goal aspect task etc. using the functionality provided by the user interface the professional development application may generate association data describing the association to the plan management module and the plan management module may revise annotate the development plan described by development plan data stored in data store based on the association data received from the professional development application .

In some embodiments the list region may include filtering elements for filtering the development plans shown in the list region . For example an administrator user who administrates a number of districts and schools may instruct the professional development application to narrow the development plans listed in the list region by selecting a specific district school and or filtering out any inactive schools or schools no longer administrated by the administrator user . In some embodiments each development plan may include metadata describing the district school teacher principal administrator etc. that it is associated with and the filtering performed by the professional development application and or the plan management module may compare the metadata to data associated with the administrator user to determine if the development plan should be shown in the list region . In some embodiments the data associated with the administrator user is information included user account data such as district and school information which is stored in and accessed from the data store by the professional development application and or the plan management module .

In some embodiments the user interface may include elements such as a new plan button and a copy plan button for creating a template development plan. The template development plan may be created from scratch or may be copied from a previously created development plan displayed in the list region . The list view may also include default plan templates provided by the plan management module . The default plan templates may reflect development plans that are commonly used such as a new teacher template an elementary math template etc. or may be training templates for learning to use various tools and functionality of the professional development application the professional development application engine and or management engine . In some embodiments the administrator may copy a default plan template to create a new plan. The user interface may also include a share button for sharing a plan created by the user with one or more other users. For example a user administrator may have created a plan that has proven to be particularly effective and may share that plan with other users for them to use and or assign to those that they oversee. It should be understood that the development plans may be shared between any combination of users and or administrator users .

In the depicted embodiment the display region includes a tab for creating and or editing the development plan highlighted in the list region a tab for assigning unassigning the development plan s highlighted in the list region and a tab for reporting on the development plan highlighted in the list region . In some embodiments a development plan may be created by an administrator user that oversees one or more other users and then assigned to those users to track their progress e.g. relative to the goals defined therein . As depicted in when the tab is selected the display region may include functionality that is the same or substantially similar to the user interfaces described in reference to . In the interest of brevity this functionality will not be repeated here. The administrator user may use the functionality of the user interfaces etc. to create and or edit a development plan. In some embodiments the display region includes elements managing a plan created by a user that he she oversees. For example the display region may include a general feedback button that is selectable to input and submit general feedback about a plan an approval button for approving a plan created by a subordinate user and a rejection button for rejecting a plan created by a subordinate user .

When creating or editing a development plan the administrator user may define a time period for when the various items e.g. goals actions tasks etc. of the development plan should be completed. For example as depicted in the user interface may include a date selector for inputting the date for when one or more of the goals action items and specific tasks included in the development plan are due. The user interface may also include a required button for defining whether one or more of the goals action items and specific tasks are required. In some embodiments the items of the development plan may be set as required on an individualized basis or the user interface may include a user interface element for setting all aspects of the development plan as required.

While not depicted when tab is selected the display region may include elements for assigning or unassigning the development plan selected in the list region . For example the display region may include the names of the users that are overseen managed etc. by the administrator user with options to select and assign the development plan to one or more of them. In some embodiments the display region may automatically be populated with a list of identifiers representing the users that the administrator user manages and the administrator user may select and unselect users from that list. When the users to which the development plan is assigned is changed using the functionality described above the professional development application may send assignment data describing those changes to the plan management module for updating the development plan data stored in data store . In some embodiments once a development plan is assigned only the administrator user or other users given permission by the administrator user may modify the development plan. In these embodiments a user being overseen or managed by the administrator user may add additional aspects e.g. goals actions tasks etc. as well as associated achievements to supplement the underlying development plan created by the administrator user and then shared with the administrator user . By way of further example a chief school administrator may oversee several districts and may broadcast various plans over the entire district for assignment to and use by the administrators and teachers in those districts.

When tab is selected the display region may include a report region not shown for requesting that a report be generated for a given development plan by the reporting module of the management engine . While not depicted the report region may include a button that when selected instructs the professional development application to generate and send a report instruction to the reporting module instructing the reporting module to generate and provide the report. In some embodiments the report may be generated and provided directly to the requesting user for download for example as a portable document such as a PDF or via a web based interface generated by the application development engine. In these or other embodiments the report may be attached to an electronic message e.g. email text message etc. or included directly in the message and sent to one or more electronic addresses selected and or provided by the requesting user . The report may be distributed via any electronic messaging system such as email text message an internal messaging system of the professional development application engine an external electronic messaging system provided by a third party server etc. While the above reporting functionality is described with reference to an administrator user it is also contemplated that the above described report region may be displayed in the user interface or any other user interface generated by the professional development application and may provide any user the ability to have reports generated for development plans associated with his or her user account. In some cases the user may then forward the report to an administrator user and or keep the report for his her records.

As depicted in in some embodiments a report may be embodied by a user interface that displays the development plans associated with an administrator user and the progress of the each of the users associated with those development plans. The user interface may include a plan selection region for selecting and or filtering the development plans a user region for displaying and selecting the users associated with the development plan highlighted in the plan selection region and a detail region for displaying the progress of the user and providing feedback on the development plan or various aspects thereof.

The plan selection region may include an element for opening and editing a given development plan e.g. see and information about the development plan including a description of the plan the creator of the plan the start and expiration dates associated with the development plan etc. In some embodiments selecting the creator s name opens an interface for viewing that user s profile and or activity on the professional development application messaging the user etc.

The user region may include information about each of the users associated with the development plan highlighted using the plan selection region . For example an administrator user may select a plan e.g. a row of the table in the plan selection region and the user region may be refreshed with information about the users associated with e.g. assigned to the selected plan as provided by the management engine . This information may include for each user that user s name an indication of that user s progress on the development plan a button for initializing a messaging interface for sending the user an electronic message. The user region may also include an edit button for editing the users that are associated e.g. assigned to the selected development plan. For example selecting the edit button may display a dialog that includes functionality for assigning users to or unassigning users from the development plan as discussed above with reference to tab .

The detail region may include the details of the development plan as well as status indicators and that reflect whether the user has satisfied the requirements of the development plan. For example as depicted in the detail region may include a status indicator showing that the user has not yet completed watching three time management videos and a status indicator that the user has completed one of the videos. In some embodiments the detail region may also include the feedback functionality described above with reference to thus allowing the user and the administrator to easily and conveniently discuss the development plan and the user s progress therewith.

Using the portfolio functionality provided by the professional development application in cooperation with the management engine a user may create any number of portfolios having any number of achievements. For example additional portfolio related interfaces may be rendered and displayed by the professional development application that display all of the user s portfolios and sharing functionality e.g. a sharing button user selector etc. to select the portfolio he she wishes to share as well as the users that he she wishes to share the portfolio with. This is advantageous as users can use this functionality to create and share a portfolio of accomplishments with an administrator to demonstrate what efforts the user has made to improve over a period of time and the administrator can consider this portfolio when doing a formal evaluation of the user s performance e.g. for a promotion annual review etc. .

As will be understood by those familiar with the art the present disclosure may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. Likewise the particular naming and division of the modules routines features attributes methodologies and other aspects are not mandatory or significant and the mechanisms that implement the present disclosure or its features may have different names divisions and or formats. Furthermore it should be understood that the modules routines features attributes methodologies and other aspects of the disclosure can be implemented as software hardware firmware or any combination of the three. Also wherever a component an example of which is a module of the present disclosure is implemented as software the component can be implemented as a standalone program as part of a larger program as a plurality of separate programs as a statically or dynamically linked library as a kernel loadable module as a device driver and or in every and any other way. Additionally the disclosure is in no way limited to implementation in any specific programming language or for any specific operating system or environment. Accordingly the disclosure is intended to be illustrative but not limiting of the scope of the subject matter set forth in the following claims.
