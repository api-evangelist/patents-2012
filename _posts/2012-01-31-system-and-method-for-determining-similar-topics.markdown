Many different users may interact with information and data stored in databases. Users may for example interact with one or more documents including content related to one or more topics. It may desirable to determine and or identify topics similar to or related to a given topic.

Briefly aspects of the present disclosure are directed to methods and systems for determining similar topics which may include receiving user information for one or more users the user information including at least one topic and a user value for each topic where the user value represents how strongly the user is associated with that topic. Topic information for a source topic may be generated based on the user information the topic information including at least one user and a topic value for each user where the topic value represents how strongly the topic is associated with that user. Similarity scores may be generated based on a topic value for each user for the source topic and a topic value for the same user for each topic in a set of topics where each topic in the set of topics is associated with a topic value for each user. One or more similar topics may be selected based on the generated similarity scores. One or more of the selected topics may be output.

This SUMMARY is provided to briefly identify some aspects of the present disclosure that are further described below in the DESCRIPTION. This SUMMARY is not intended to identify key or essential features of the present disclosure nor is it intended to limit the scope of any claims.

In there is shown a flow diagram which defines steps of a method according to aspects of the present disclosure. Methods and systems of the present disclosure may be implemented using for example a computer system as depicted in or any other system and or device.

In operation user information for one or more users may be received by for example system . User information for a user e.g. a user signature may include for example at least one topic and a user value e.g. a value for each topic. A user value may represent how strongly a user is associated with a topic.

Topics may be for example categories abstract ideas subjects things and or concepts representing content or subject matter of a file e.g. a document audio file video file spreadsheet text file word processing file or other type of file . Topics may be for example an abstract notion of what a file e.g. a document pertains to is related to and or is about. A topic may in some aspects be a concept that at least a portion of the file e.g. document is about. A topic may or may not be a term present in a document text but may be for example associated with one or more terms present in a document and may be generated by natural language processing NLP or other processes based on one or more terms in a document and or other information. For example a file e.g. a document may include information e.g. text about cars planes and boats all of which appear as terms verbatim in the file. More abstractly however it may be determined that the file is about vehicles and modes of transportation. Topics associated with the document may therefore be vehicles modes of transportation and or other topics.

A user value may for example represent how strongly a user is associated with a topic. A user may be associated with a topic by for example interacting with files documents web pages information and or data related to and or including that topic. A user may interact with a file document web page information and or data related to a topic by adding removing editing viewing and or otherwise interacting with information related to a topic e.g. information in a document audio file video file spreadsheet word processing file text file or any other type of file . A user may for example interact with a topic in a document by adding removing editing and or otherwise altering document content related to a topic. A user may interact with a topic by viewing opening subscribing to tagging starring sharing and or otherwise interacting with a file or other data that includes text and or content related to a topic.

Files as discussed herein may include documents document text video files audio files computer code and or any other type of file. Document text may be for example a text based representation of a document. A document may include text e.g. a word processing document text file portable document format pdf spreadsheet or presentation or may have text associated therewith such as in a transcript when the document is a video e.g. a web based video digital video file or any other type of video an audio file e.g. an audio recording podcast or any type of audio and or another type of electronically stored file. A document may in some aspects be a web page computer instructions e.g. computer code in any language or any other internet and or computer related file. Document text may be present in a document text file separate from the document. In that case the document text file may be linked to and or stored with the document and or may be stored separately. It will be understood that operations involving the text of a document may be performed on or with the document or the document text file depending on the location of text.

In some aspects user information for one or more users e.g. including at least one topic and a user value for each topic may be received from an automatic process operating on data associated with the one or more users. An automatic process operating on data associated with a user may for example be a process method and or approach using natural language processing NLP user topic interest computation user topic authority computation and or other approaches to determine user association with one or more topics. An automatic process for determining user topic authority may for example be used to generate for a user one or more topics and a user authority value for each topic representing a level amount and or strength of a user s expertise or authority in a topic. An automatic process for determining user topic interest may for example be used to generate for a user one or more topics and a user interest value for each topic representing a level amount and or extent of a user s interest in a topic.

In some aspects a user value may include a user authority value. A user authority value may be a user authority signature value e.g. authority signature value as discussed in patent application Ser. No. 13 363 210 filed Jan. 31 2012 for SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING TOPIC AUTHORITY which is incorporated herein by reference. A user authority value may for example represent a user s authority or expertise related to a topic. A user authority value e.g. user authority signature value for a topic may for example be generated based on authorship information for a user for one or more files e.g. documents weights of topics in the one or more files and or other information. Authorship information for a file e.g. a document may include for each topic in the document at least one user e.g. author and an authorship percentage e.g. topic authorship percentage for each user e.g. author . Authorship information may for example include for each of one or more topic s in a document an authorship contribution and or creation percentage for each user e.g. author . An authorship percentage for a user may for example represent a portion amount or quantity of a topic authored generated and or created by that user e.g. author . A user authority value for a topic may be for example a sum of products across one or more documents each product term including a product of an authorship percentage for a topic in a document and a weight of that topic in that document.

In some aspects a user value may include a user interest value. A user interest value may be a user interest signature value e.g. an interest signature value as discussed in patent application Ser. No. 13 363 169 filed Jan. 31 2012 for SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING TOPIC INTEREST which is incorporated herein by reference. A user interest value may for example represent a degree amount extent and or strength of a user s interest in and or association with a topic. A user interest value may for example be a sum of products of one or more values representing user interest in a file e.g. a document and a weight of a topic in that file e.g. document . A value representing user interest in a file may for example represent a degree magnitude and or strength of a user s interest in a file e.g. a document . A value representing a user s interest in a file may for example be calculated based on document interaction characteristics document access characteristics document editing characteristics and or document sharing characteristics. A product of a value representing a user s interest in a file and a weight of a topic in that file may represent and or quantify a user s interest in that topic in that file. One or more products of values representing a user s interest in a file and a weight of a topic in that file for one or more files may be summed to generate an interest value of that topic for a user.

A user value may in some aspects represent a confidence of association between a topic and a user. A user value e.g. corresponding to a topic may represent a confidence certainty and or likelihood that a user is associated with a topic. For example a user value e.g. 0.70 may indicate a confidence of 70 that a user is related to a topic e.g. the user is interested in the topic has authority on the topic or is otherwise associated with the topic .

In some aspects user information for one or more users may be received from a user. User information for one or more users may include for each user at least one topic and a user value for each topic for that user. User information for one or more users may be received from for example a user among the one or more users or any other user. User information may be received from a user e.g. a source user or any other user by way of for example a component or device associated with system . For example a user may wish to identify or determine similar topics to one or more topics that the user may be interested in. The user may input user information including at least one topic and user value for each topic.

In some aspects a source topic identified by a user may be received. A user may for example identify a source topic by inputting an identity of a source topic to system selecting a source topic from a set of topics e.g. a list of topics or otherwise identifying a source topic. The source topic and at least one topic and user value for each topic may be used to select one or more topics similar to the source topic.

In operation topic information for a source topic may be generated based on user information. Topic information may include at least one user and a topic value for each user. Topic information for a source topic may for example include one or more users and a topic value for each user. A topic value may for example represent how strongly a topic is associated with a user.

A topic value may in some aspects be based on or be equivalent to a user value. For example a topic value representing how strongly a topic is associated with a user may be based on or equivalent to a user value representing how strongly that user is associated with that topic. In some aspects one or more topic values for a topic may generated by determining one or more users associated with that topic and a user value for each of the users of that topic.

In some aspects topic information for a topic e.g. a source topic may be generated by referencing and storing for each topic one or more user values associated with that topic. The user values for that topic for one or more users may be normalized to generate topic values for that topic for each of the users.

User values for one or more topics may for example be stored in one or more arrays vectors matrices tables and or other data structures of user values for a user for one or more topics. An array of topic values for a topic may for example be generated by referencing each array of user values that include a user value for a user of that topic. The user values for each user of that topic may be stored in an array of topic information for that topic.

In some aspects one or more user values e.g. each user value for a topic for that user stored in an array of topic information may be normalized to generate topic values e.g. normalized user values for each user. User values for each topic may be normalized such that all topic values for a topic e.g. normalized user values sum to 1.0 100 and or any other value. Topic values e.g. normalized user values may be computed and or generated by for example dividing each user value for each of one or more users for that topic by a sum of all user values for each of the one or more users for that topic.

By way of example user information may be received for two users user X and user Y. As shown in the following array and or table user information for user X may include three topics e.g. topic A topic B and topic C and a user value for each topic e.g. topic A user value topic B user value and topic C user value . User information for user Y may include three topics e.g. topic B topic C topic D and a user value for each topic e.g. topic B user value topic C user value and topic D user value .

Topic information for one or more topics e.g. topic A topic B topic C and topic D may be generated by for example referencing and storing user values for one or more users from the above array e.g. Table 1 . As shown in the array and or table below a user value array may be referenced to generate an array of user values for each topic e.g. an inverted array of user values transposed array of user values .

Topic information for topic A may include one user e.g. user X and a user value for user X for topic A e.g. 0.2 . Topic information for topic B may include two users e.g. user X and user Y a user value for user X for topic A e.g. 0.5 and a user value for user Y of topic B e.g. 0.6 . Topic information for topic C may include two users e.g. user X and user Y a user value for user X for topic C e.g. 0.3 and a user value for user Y of topic C e.g. 0.2 . Topic information for topic D may include two topics e.g. user Y and a user value for user Y for topic D e.g. 0.2 .

In some aspects user values for one or more users for each topic may be normalized to generate topic values for each topic. User values may be normalized such that all normalized user values and or topic values for a topic sum to 1.0 100 or any other value. As shown in the array and or table below user values for one or more topics taken from and or referenced from Tables 1 and 2 above may be normalized to generate topic information for four topics e.g. topic A topic B topic C and topic D .

Topic information for topic A may include for example one user e.g. user X and a topic value for user X e.g. 1.0 . A topic value for user X of 1.0 may indicate and or represent that only one user e.g. user X has authority is interested and or has otherwise interacted with documents or files including topic A. In this example a topic value for user Y may be equal to 0.0 e.g. zero which may indicate that user Y has not interacted with topic A e.g. user Y may not have authority in interest in or expertise related to topic A . Topic information for topic B may include two users e.g. user X and user Y a topic value for user X e.g. 0.45 and a topic value for user Y e.g. 0.55 . Topic information for topic C may include two users e.g. user X and user Y a topic value for user X e.g. 0.6 and a topic value for user Y e.g. 0.4 . Topic information for topic D may include for example one user e.g. user Y and a topic value for user Y e.g. 0.0 .

In operation similarity scores may be generated based on topic values. Similarity scores between a source topic and a topic in a set of topics may be generated based on a topic value for each user for the source topic and a topic vale for the same user in the topic in the set of topics. Each topic in a set of topics may be associated with a topic value for each user. In some aspects similarity scores may be generated between a source topic and each topic in a set of topics based on a topic value for each user for the source topic and a topic value for the same user for each topic in a set of topics. A topic value may be for example a number percentage scalar and or other type of value. One or more topic values for a topic may for example be included in a vector array matrix table and or any other type of data set.

A similarity score between a source topic and a first topic may be for example equal to a sum of products of topic values for the source topic and topic values for the first topic. Each product in the sum of products may be a product of a topic value for a user for the source topic and a topic value for the same user for the first topic.

Similarity scores between a source topic and one or more topics in a set of topics may be generated. A set of topics may include for example one or more topics associated with a group collection category and or other set of topics. A source topic may in some aspects be included in or be a member of one or more sets of topics. Each topic in a set of topics may be associated with a topic value e.g. including at least one user and a topic value for each user .

A topic value e.g. a topic authority value a topic interest value for a source topic may for example be compared to topic values for each of one or more topics in a set of topics. Each comparison may be between two topics e.g. a source topic and a topic in a set of topics . In comparing topic values a topic value for a user associated with a source topic may be compared to a topic value for the same user for the topic within a set of topics. Similarity scores may be generated based on the comparison e.g. one similarity score may be computed for each pair wise topic comparison between the source topic and a topic within the set of topics . A process of generating similarity scores may be repeated for each user associated with a source topic.

In some aspects a similarity score may be generated by computing a sum of products of topic values a cosine similarity of topic values or using other mathematical approaches. A similarity score may be generated by computing a sum of products of topic values for a source topic and respective topic values associated with a topic within a set of topics. For example a similarity score between a source topic and a topic within a set of topics may be computed by multiplying a topic value for a user for the source topic by a topic value for the same user for the topic within the set of topics. The process may be repeated for each topic value for the source topic for each user and each topic value for the topic within the set of topics for each user. The process may be repeated for each topic value for each topic e.g. among the set of topics .

In some aspects a particular topic value for a topic for a user may be zero if the user has not interacted with e.g. viewed edited drafted and or otherwise interacted with any documents including that topic. In that case a similarity score e.g. product of a topic value for a first topic for that user of zero multiplied a topic value for a second topic for the same user may result in a similarity score of zero e.g. 0.0 indicating no similarity between the two topics with respect to that user.

In some aspects similarity scores may be generated by computing or calculating a cosine similarity of topic values for each user associated with a source topic. A cosine similarity value score or parameter may be a quantity representing how similar a vector representing topic values associated with a first topic is to a vector representing topic values associated with a second topic. A cosine similarity score may be for example a number between 0.0 and 1.0 a percentage any range of numbers and or value s . A cosine similarity Sim S T may be calculated using an equation such as 

A cosine similarity Sim S T may for example be calculated based on a vector representing topic values S for a source topic and a vector representing topic values for a topic in a set of topics T. A cosine similarity score may be for example a normalized dot product of a vector representing topic values for a source topic S and a vector representing topic values for a topic included in a set of topics T. A vector representing topic values for a source topic S may include topic values for each user associated with a source topic. A vector representing topic values for a topic within a set of topics T may include topic values for each user for that topic. If a user e.g. a source user or a user in a set of users has not interacted with a topic a topic value of zero may be assigned to that user in a vector representing topic values for that topic.

A dot product or sum of products may be normalized by dividing the dot product by a product of a norm of a vector representing topic values associated with a source topic S and a norm of a vector representing topic values associated with a topic in a set of topics T . A vector norm may for example be a length and or magnitude of a vector e.g. Euclidian distance of a vector . Normalizing the dot product may for example ensure that each similarity score e.g. cosine similarity score is between 0 and 1 or another range.

As shown in the following table a similarity score may be generated between a source topic and a first topic e.g. a topic in a set of topics . A similarity score e.g. a cosine similarity of topic values between a source topic and a first topic may be generating based on a vector representing topic values associated with a source topic e.g. 0.6 0.4 0.0 and a vector representing topic values associated with the first topic e.g. 1.0 0.0 0.0 .

A similarity score between a source topic and a first topic may be for example a cosine similarity of topic values for each user which may be equal to 0.83. Similarity scores may also be generated between the source topic and other topics in a set of topics using a similar approach.

In operation similar topics e.g. one or more similar topics may be selected and output. One or more similar topics may be selected based on generated similarity scores e.g. similarity scores between a source topic and each of one or more topics in a set of topics . Topics may for example be ranked grouped and or categorized based on similarity scores and one or more similar topics may be selected based on the ranking grouping and or categorization.

In some aspects one or more topics associated with one or more highest generated similarity scores may be selected. For example a highest ranked topic in a set of topics or a topic associated with a highest similarity score may be selected. In some aspects any number of highest ranked topics e.g. a top N scoring and or ranking topics or a list of the top N scoring and or ranking topics may be selected. A number of topics to be selected may be determined by for example a topic a system or device in system and or any other system or device.

According to some aspects selecting one or more similar topics may include comparing a similarity score for each topic in a set of topics e.g. a similarity score between a source topic and each topic in a set of topics to a threshold similarity score and selecting one or more similar topics based on the comparison. A threshold similarity score may be for example a predetermined threshold similarity score e.g. a fixed threshold similarity score a static threshold similarity score a manual threshold similarity score a varying threshold similarity score or any other type of threshold similarity score. A predetermined threshold similarity score may be any similarity score generated by for example a user system or another system and or process. One or more topics associated with similarity scores above a threshold similarity score may be selected and or may be deemed similar topics. One or more selected topics may be output to for example a user a component of system and or any other system or device.

In some aspects one or more topics associated with similarity scores above an automatically determined threshold similarity score may be deemed similar topics and may be selected. An automatically determined threshold similarity score may for example be dependent on one or more similarity scores each similarity score between a source topic and a topic e.g. in a set of topics . An automatically determined threshold similarity score may for example be generated based on a distribution of similarity scores and may change as similarity score data is added removed and or altered within the similarity score distribution.

In some aspects an automatically determined threshold similarity score may be generated for example using an automatic threshold detection process or other approaches. In an automatic threshold detection process a threshold may be determined based on set of similarity score data. An automatic threshold detection process may for example be a K means difference in means hierarchical agglomerative clustering or similar approach in which similarity score data is divided into groups and or clusters based on computed mean similarity score values for each group and or cluster e.g. average values median values etc. . An automatically determined threshold similarity score may in some aspects be a boundary between groups of similarity score data and may be determined to group similarity score data into one or more groups each group including similarity score values within a minimized range of the other values in the group or an average of all values in the group. An automatically determined threshold similarity score may therefore be related to the similarity score data set and may vary as similarity score data is added removed and or altered. Each of one or more topics may be categorized into a group of topics based on whether a similarity score associated with that topic is above or below the one or more threshold similarity scores.

By way of example a set of similarity score data may include values of 0.0 0.1 0.6 0.8 0.85 and or possibly other values. Based on the similarity score data an automatically determined threshold may be generated to divide the data into for example two groups and or clusters. An automatically determined threshold which divides the similarity score data into two groups may be for example 0.4. All of the similarity score values above 0.4 e.g. 0.6 0.8 and 0.85 may for example be assigned to one group and all of the similarity score values below 0.4 e.g. 0.0 and 0.1 may be assigned to a second group. An automatically determined threshold of 0.4 may for example divide the values into two groups and the values in each group may be within a minimized distance of the average value of the group. For example an average of the first group values may be 0.75 e.g. 0.6 0.8 0.85 3 and each value in the first group may be within 0.15 of the average value e.g. 0.75 . Similarly each value in the second group may be within 0.05 of the group average e.g. 0.05 0.0 0.1 2 .

For example if a new topic is added to a set of topics a similarity score between the new topic and a source topic may be generated. As a result of the new similarity score a data distribution of similarity scores associated with the source topic e.g. between the source topic and each of one or more topics in a set of topics may change. A varying threshold similarity score that is determined based on similarity scores between a source topic and each of one or more topics in a set of topics may therefore also vary as a result of changes to topic s in a set of topics.

Similarly an automatically determined similarity score may be altered if topics are removed from a set of topics topic values associated with one or more topics in a set of topics change or based on other events or changes.

Similar topics may include a cluster or group of topics associated with best high or most favorable similarity scores. For example a subset of topics may be a predetermined number of topics with best or most favorable similarity scores. Best or most favorable similarity scores may be for example similarity scores indicating a highest similarity between a source topic and a topic e.g. within a set of topics .

In some aspects a number of similar topics may be limited to a maximum predetermined number of topics. A maximum predetermined number of topics may be set by a user e.g. in a settings dialog panel screen menu and or other interface may be automatically determined or may be set by another system or device.

In some aspects a source topic may be a topic in a set of topics. User information may be received for one or more users e.g. including at least one topic and a user value for each topic topic information for a source topic e.g. including at least one user and topic value for each user may be generated based on the user information similarity scores may be generated based on a topic value for each user for the source topic and a topic value for the same user for each topic in a set of topics one or more similar topics may be selected based on the generated similarity scores and one or more similar topics may be output. The steps e.g. receiving user information generating topic information generating similarity scores selecting one or more similar topics and outputting one or more similar topics may be repeated for each topic in a set of topics.

In some aspects each topic in a set of topics may be assigned to one or more groups of topics based on generated similarity scores e.g. between a source topic and the each topic in a set of topics . One or more groups of topics may for example be output to a user system and or another device or system. Topics may be categorized into groups e.g. classes categories buckets and or bins of topics using for example an automatic grouping clustering or other approach. In an automatic grouping approach one or more automatically determined threshold similarity scores may be generated for example using an automatic threshold detection or another approach.

By way of example one or more topics may be categorized classified and or grouped into three or any other number of groups of topics based on similarity scores. One or more topics associated with similarity score values above a first threshold similarity score e.g. an automatically determined threshold similarity score may for example be categorized into a first group. Similarly one or more topics associated with similarity scores below the first threshold similarity score and above a second threshold similarity score e.g. an automatically determined threshold similarity score score may be categorized into a second group. One or more topics associated with similarity scores below the second threshold similarity score may be categorized into a third group of topics. Any number of threshold similarity scores may be used to group topics into any number of categories groups or sets of topics.

In some aspects a title for a group of topics may be generated based on topics present in the group of topics. A title for a group of topics may for example be generated based on one or more topics in the group of topics using a natural language processing NLP or a similar method or process. For example a group of topics may include three topics e.g. topic A airplanes topic B bicycles and topic C cars or any other number of topics. Based on the topics in the group of topic it may be determined that a title for the group of users should be for example modes of transportation vehicles airplanes bicycles cars or another title based on an identity of the topics in the group of topics.

In some aspects the receiving generating topic information generating similarity scores selecting and outputting steps may be initiated in response to a user selecting a source topic. Operation operation operation and operation may be performed in response to input from a user e.g. a user selecting a source topic a trigger event or in response to any other input. In response to a user selecting a source topic a trigger event or any other action user information for one or more users may be received topic information for the source topic may be generated similarity scores between the source topic and one or more topics in a set of topics may be generated one or more similar topics may be selected based on the generated similarity scores and one or more similar topics may be output. A trigger event may be for example an addition of a topic to a set of topics addition of a user to a set of users creation of a new user e.g. addition of user information for a new user creation of a new set of users e.g. a group of users creation of a new set of topics editing information for a user in a set of users removal of a user from set of users a change of information for a user in a set of users or any other event or action which may result in a change to a set of users a set of topics or other information. A trigger event may for example occur at any time and may be the result of user input other processes or systems or other factors.

In some aspects an identity of one or more similar topics may be output in response to input from a user. A user may for example input a topic e.g. to system enter an identity of a source topic and or otherwise enter information. A user may for example enter a topic e.g. a source topic in order to determine other topics that may be of interest to the user. A user may for example wish to identify possible topics of interest to the user based on a source topic. Based on the information input from the user similarity scores may be generated between a source topic and one or more topics one or more similar topics may be selected based on the similarity scores and one or more similar topics may be output. One or more similar topics may be output to a user e.g. using a component of system to system and or to another system or device.

According to some aspects a representation of one or more similar topics may be output. A representation of similar users may be for example a graphical representation of similar topics e.g. a graphical model graph plot table bar graph pie chart or other graphical representation of similar users a list of similar topics e.g. a list or table of similar users in a preview pane window or other displays and or any other type of data representation.

In some aspects an identity of one or more overlapping users and a value indicating a degree of overlap e.g. user overlap value for each overlapping user may be output. Overlapping users e.g. common users shared users may be for example users associated with two or more topics e.g. both a first topic a second topic and possibly other topics . For example topic information for a first topic e.g. topic B may include three users user X user Y and user Z and a topic value for each user user X topic value e.g. 0.31 user Y topic value e.g. 0.38 and user Z topic value e.g. 0.31 . Topic information for a second topic e.g. topic C may include two users user X and user Y and a topic value for each user user X topic value e.g. 0.6 and user Y topic value e.g. 0.4 . In this example overlapping users for the first topic e.g. topic B and the second topic e.g. topic C may include user X and user Y. A degree of overlap for each overlapping user may be computed based on a similarity score between the first topic and the second topic for that overlapping user. A degree of overlap for a user e.g. a degree of user overlap between a first topic and a second topic may be equal to for example a product of a topic value for the first topic for that user and a topic value for the second topic for that user.

By way of example a value representing a degree of overlap for user X between the first topic e.g. topic B and the second topic e.g. topic C may be equal to a product of a topic value for topic C for user X e.g. 0.6 and topic value for topic B for user X e.g. 0.31 which may equal to 0.19. Similarly a value representing a degree of overlap for user Y between the first topic e.g. topic B and the second topic e.g. topic C may be equal to 0.15. The one or more overlapping users e.g. user X and user Y and a value indicating a degree overlap e.g. user X overlap value 0.19 and user Y overlap value 0.15 for each overlapping topic may be output.

In some aspects one or more overlapping users associated with one or more highest degrees of overlap may be output. For example overlapping users may be ranked in order of degree of overlap e.g. in descending or ascending order of degree of overlap and a highest ranked user may be selected and output. In some aspects any number of highest ranked users e.g. a top N scoring and or ranking users or a list of the top N scoring and or ranking users may be output. A number of overlapping users selected and output may be determined by for example a user a system or device in system and or any other system or device.

In some aspects one or more overlapping users associated with degrees of overlap above a threshold degree of overlap may be output. A threshold degree of overlap may be for example a predefined threshold degree of overlap e.g. a fixed degree of overlap an automatically determined threshold degree of overlap or other type of threshold. A predetermined degree of overlap may be determined by for example a user a system or device associated with system and or any other system or device. An automatically determined threshold similarity score may be generated for example using an automatic threshold detection process or other approaches. An automatically determined threshold degree of overlap may be used in a clustering method e.g. K means clustering hierarchical agglomerative clustering or another clustering algorithm to group or cluster sets of users based on degree of overlap. One or more users in a group or cluster of users may be output.

In this example user information and or a user signature for user X may include at least one topic e.g. three topics a user value for each topic and or other information. A user signature for user X may include three topics topic A topic B and topic C and a user value for each topic topic A user value e.g. 0.2 topic B user value e.g. 0.5 and topic C user value e.g. 0.3 . Each user value for a topic may represent for example how strongly user X is associated with that topic.

In some aspects user values for each topic may be normalized such that all normalized user values for a user sum to 1.0 100 and or any other value. Normalized user values may be computed or generated by dividing each user value for a topic by a sum of all user values for that user for each topic. User values for user X for each topic in this example may be normalized user values. The user values for user X for each topic may have been generated or computed by dividing the user value for each topic by a sum of all user values for user X for each topic.

In this example user information and or a user signature for user Y may include at least one topic e.g. three topics a user value for each topic and or other information. A user signature for user Y may include three topics topic B topic C and topic D and a user value for each topic topic B user value e.g. 0.6 topic C user value e.g. 0.2 and topic D user value e.g. 0.2 .

In this example user information and or a user signature for user Z may include at least one topic e.g. three topics a user value for each topic and or other information. A user signature for user Z may include three topics topic B topic D and topic E and a user value for each topic topic B user value e.g. 0.5 topic D user value e.g. 0.1 and topic E user value e.g. 0.4 .

A topic value may in some aspects be equivalent to and or may be based on a user value. Topic information for a topic may be generated by referencing and storing user values for one or more users for that topic. User values for one or more topics may for example be stored in an array vector matrix table and or other data structure.

In some aspects one or more user values e.g. each user value for a topic for that user may be normalized to generate topic values e.g. normalized user values for each user. User values for each topic may be normalized such that all topic values for a topic e.g. normalized user values sum to 1.0 100 and or any other value. Topic values e.g. normalized user values may be computed and or generated by for example dividing each user value for each of one or more users for that topic by a sum of all user values for each of the one or more users for that topic.

In this example topic information and or topic signature for topic A may include at least one user e.g. one user user X a topic value for each user e.g. a normalized user value and possibly other information. Topic values for topic A for each user may be generated by normalizing user values for each user for topic A . A user value for user X may for example be normalized to generate a topic value for user X. A topic value for user X may be computed and or generated by for example dividing a user value for user X for topic A e.g. 0.2 by a sum of all user values for each of one or more users for topic A e.g. user value for user X for topic A 0.2 . A topic value for topic A for user X may be for example 1.0. A topic value for topic A for user Y and a topic value for topic A for user Z may be equal to zero indicating that user Y and user Z may not have interacted e.g. substantially interacted with files e.g. documents including content related to topic A.

In this example topic information and or topic signature for topic B may include at least one user e.g. three users user X user Y user Z a topic value for each user and possibly other information. Topic values for topic B for each user may be generated by normalizing user values for each user for topic B . A topic value for topic B for user X e.g. 0.31 may be generated based on a user value for user. X for topic B e.g. 0.5 and a sum of all user values for one or more user values for topic B . A topic value for topic B for user X may be computed and or generated by for example dividing a user value for user X for topic B e.g. 0.5 by a sum of all user values for each of one or more users for topic B e.g. user value for user X user value for user Y user value for user Z 1.6 . A topic value for topic B for user X may be for example 0.31. Similarly a topic value for user Y for topic B may be equal to 0.38 and a topic value for user Z for topic B may be equal to 0.31.

In this example topic information and or topic signature for topic C may include two users e.g. user X user Y a topic value for each user and possibly other information. A topic value for topic C for user X e.g. 0.6 and a topic value for topic C for user Y e.g. 0.4 may be calculated using an approach similar to the methods and or approaches discussed above in reference to topic signature for topic A and topic signature for topic B .

In this example topic information and or topic signature for topic D may include two users e.g. user Y user Z a topic value for each user and possibly other information. A topic value for topic D for user Y e.g. 0.67 and a topic value for topic D for user Z e.g. 0.33 may be calculated using an approach similar to the methods and or approaches discussed above in reference to topic signature for topic A and topic signature for topic B .

In this example topic information and or topic signature for topic E may include one user e.g. user Z a topic value for each user and possibly other information. A topic value for topic E for user Z e.g. 1.0 may be calculated using an approach similar to the methods and or approaches discussed above in reference to topic signature for topic A and topic signature for topic B .

By way of example similarity scores may be generated between a source topic e.g. topic C and one or more topics e.g. topic A topic B topic D and topic E in a set of topics. In this example a source topic may be topic C and the topics in a set of topics may be topic A topic B topic D and topic E as discussed above in connection with and . In this example topic values for a source topic e.g. topic C for each user may be for example a vector of topic values e.g. 0.6 0.4 0.0 where a topic value for the source topic for user X is equal to 0.6 a topic value for user Y is equal to 0.4 and a topic value for user Z is equal to 0.0. Topic values for topic A for each user may be for example be a vector of topic values e.g. 1.0 0.0 0.0 . Topic values for topic B for each user may be for example be a vector of topic values e.g. 0.31 0.38 0.31 . Topic values for topic D for each user may be for example be a vector of topic values e.g. 0.0 0.67 0.33 . Topic values for topic E for each user may be for example be a vector of topic values e.g. 0.0 0.0 1.0 .

A similarity score e.g. a cosine similarity of topic values between a source topic and topic A may be generated by computing and or calculating a dot product of a vector representing topic values for a source topic e.g. 0.6 0.4 0.0 and a vector representing topic values for topic A e.g. 1.0 0.0 0.0 and dividing the dot product by the product of the norm of the vector representing topic values for the source topic e.g. 0.6 0.4 0.0 and the norm of the vector representing topic values for a topic A e.g. 1.0 0.0 0.0 . A cosine similarity of topic values between a source topic and topic A may in this example be equal to 0.83 or another value.

A cosine similarity of topic values may be computed by calculating a dot product of a vector representing topic values for a source topic e.g. 0.6 0.4 0.0 and a vector representing topic values for topic B e.g. 0.31 0.38 0.31 and dividing the dot product by the product of the norm of the vector representing topic values for the source topic e.g. 0.6 0.4 0.0 and the norm of the vector representing topic values for topic B e.g. 0.31 0.38 0.31 . A cosine similarity of topic values between a source topic and topic B may in this example be equal to 0.81 or another value.

A cosine similarity of topic values between a source topic and topic D may generated using similar methods and or approaches as those used above to generate cosine similarity values between a source topic and topic A and topic B. A cosine similarity of topic values between a source topic and topic D may be equal to 0.5 or another value.

Similarly a cosine similarity of topic values between a source topic and topic E may be equal to 0.0 or another value. A cosine similarity of 0.0 may indicate that the source topic and topic E do not share any common users and may indicate that the source topic and topic E are not related and or are not similar.

One or more similar topics may be selected based on generated similarity scores e.g. cosine similarity scores . In some aspects one or more topics associated with one or more highest similarity scores may be selected. In this example a similarity score between a source topic and topic A e.g. 0.83 may be higher than a similarity score between the source topic and topic B e.g. 0.81 topic D e.g. 0.5 or topic E e.g. 0.0 . An indication of the highest ranked topics may be generated based on a ranked list of topics. A ranked list of topics based on similarity scores may include for example topic A ranked above topic B topic B ranked above topic D and topic D ranked above topic E. In one example it may be specified that a highest ranked topic should be selected and output and topic A may for example be selected and output e.g. to a user system or another system or device . In some aspects any number of topics e.g. a top N scoring and or ranking topics or a list of the top N scoring and or ranking topics may be output e.g. to a user system or another system or device . The column labeled TOP N may indicate whether a similarity score for a topic e.g. topic A topic B topic D or topic E is among the top N e.g. in this example a top one N 1 and or highest similarity scores.

One or more similar topics may be selected based on a threshold similarity score. A threshold similarity score may be for example a predetermined or fixed threshold similarity score an automatically determined threshold similarity score and or any other type of threshold similarity score.

In this example a predetermined threshold similarity score may be equal to 0.75 or any other value. A predetermined threshold similarity score may be set and or defined by a user by system and or by any other system or device. A similarity score between a source topic and topic A e.g. 0.83 may for example be higher than a predetermined threshold similarity score e.g. 0.75 . Similarly a similarity score between a source topic and topic B e.g. 0.81 may for example be higher than a predetermined threshold similarity score e.g. 0.5 . In this example based on the predetermined threshold similarity score topic A and topic B may be deemed similar topics and an identity of topic A and topic B may be output e.g. for display to a user or to system . The column labeled FIXED E.G. 0.75 may indicate whether a similarity score for a topic e.g. topic A topic B topic D or topic E is above a predefined threshold e.g. 0.75 .

By way of example an automatically determined threshold similarity score may be equal to 0.4 or any other value. A similarity score between a source topic and topic A e.g. 0.83 a similarity score between the source topic and topic B e.g. 0.81 and a similarity score between the source topic and topic D e.g. 0.5 may for example be higher than an automatically determined threshold similarity score e.g. 0.4 . Topic A topic B and topic D may therefore be deemed a similar topics and the identity of topic A topic B and topic D may be output e.g. for display to a user or to system . A similarity score between a source topic and topic E e.g. 0.0 may for example be lower than a automatically determined threshold similarity score e.g. 0.4 . In this example topic E may be deemed a not similar topic and the identity of topic E may not be output. The column labeled AUTO E.G. 0.4 may indicate whether a similarity score for a topic e.g. topic A topic B topic D or topic E is above an automatically determined threshold e.g. 0.4 .

In this example a value representing a degree of overlap for each overlapping user between a source topic e.g. topic C and topic B may be generated. Topic information for a source topic and topic B may be the topic information as discussed above in connection with and . Topic information for a source topic may include for example three users user X user Y and a topic value for each user user X topic value e.g. 0.6 and a user Y topic value e.g. 0.4 . Topic information for topic B may include three users e.g. user X user Y and user Z and a topic value for each user user X topic value e.g. 0.31 user Y topic value e.g. 0.38 user Z topic value e.g. 0.31 . In this example overlapping users between the source topic e.g. topic C and topic B may include user X and user Y. A degree of overlap for each overlapping user may be computed based on a similarity score between the source topic and topic B for each user and or a product of topic values for the source topic and topic B. For example a value representing a degree of overlap for user X between the source topic e.g. topic C and topic B may be equal to a product of a topic value for user X for the source topic e.g. 0.6 and topic value for user X for topic B e.g. 0.31 which may equal to 0.19. Similarly a value representing a degree of overlap for user Y between the source topic and topic B may be equal to 0.15. A degree of overlap for user Z between the source topic and topic B may be zero e.g. 0.0 indicating that user Z is not an overlapping user. An identity of the one or more overlapping users e.g. user X and user Y and a value indicating a degree of overlap e.g. user X overlap value 0.19 and user Y overlap value 0.15 for each overlapping user may be output.

In some aspects one or more overlapping users associated with one or more highest degrees of overlap may be output. Overlapping users may for example be ranked in order of degree of overlap e.g. in descending or ascending order of degree of overlap and a highest ranked one or more users may be selected and output. In some aspects any number of highest ranked users e.g. a top N scoring and or ranking users or a list of the top N scoring and or ranking users may be output. In this example a highest ranked overlapping user between a source topic and topic B may be user X because user X is associated with a highest degree of overlap value equal to 0.19. An identity of user X may therefore be output. The column labeled TOP N may indicate whether a degree of overlap for a user e.g. user X user Y or user Z is among the top N e.g. in this example a top one N 1 or highest similarity scores.

In some aspects one or more overlapping users associated each associated with a degree of overlap above a threshold degree of overlap may be output. A threshold degree of overlap may be for example a predefined or fixed threshold degree of overlap e.g. a fixed degree of overlap an automatically determined threshold degree of overlap or other type of threshold. A fixed threshold degree of overlap may be determined by for example a user a system or device associated with system and or any other system or device. An automatically determined threshold degree of overlap may be generated for example using an automatic threshold detection process or other approaches.

In this example a predetermined or fixed threshold degree of overlap may be equal to 0.25 or any other value. A degree of overlap for user X between a source topic and topic B may be equal to 0.19 which is less than the predetermined threshold degree of overlap of 0.25. A degree of overlap for user Y between a source topic and topic B may be equal to 0.15 which is less than the predetermined threshold degree of overlap of 0.25. A degree of overlap for user Z between a source topic and topic B may be equal to 0.0 which is less than the predetermined threshold degree of overlap of 0.25. Based on a predetermined threshold degree of overlap user X user Y and user Z may not be output. The column labeled FIXED E.G. 0.25 may indicate whether a degree of overlap for user e.g. user X user Y or user Z is above a predefined threshold e.g. 0.25 . The fact that no users are output may possibly indicate that the predetermined threshold value may be set too high e.g. by a user or it may indicate that none of the users e.g. users X Y or Z is strongly associated with both the source topic and topic B.

In this example an automatically determined threshold degree of overlap may be equal to 0.1 or any other value. A degree of overlap for User X between a source topic and topic B may be equal to 0.19 which is greater than the automatically determined threshold degree of overlap of 0.1. A degree of overlap for user Y between a source topic and topic B may be equal to 0.15 which is greater than the predetermined threshold degree of overlap of 0.1. User X and User Y may therefore be output to for example a user system or any other system or device. The column labeled AUTO E.G. 0.1 may indicate whether a degree of overlap for user e.g. user X user Y or user Z is above an automatically determined threshold e.g. 0.1 .

In this example an automatically determined threshold degree of overlap e.g. 0.1 may be more effective in identifying overlapping users than a predetermined threshold e.g. 0.25 . Because an automatically determined threshold may be generated based on a distribution of degree of overlap values the automatically determined threshold may be more accurate in determining overlapping users between for example the source topic and topic B.
