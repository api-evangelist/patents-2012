The present application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 669 639 entitled WEB SERVER FOR REMOTE DESKTOP DISPLAY PROTOCOL filed on Jul. 9 2012. The present application is also a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 965 820 entitled METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING A REMOTE DESKTOP SESSION VIA HTML THAT SUPPORTS A 2D CANVAS AND DYNAMIC DRAWING filed on Dec. 10 2010. All of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The subject technology relates in general to communications and processing and for example to methods and systems for facilitating accessing and or controlling a remote desktop of a remote machine in real time by a web browser of a client device via HTTP.

Traditional implementations of remote desktop protocols enable a remote user to access his or her desktop or applications from a client device over a LAN or WAN network topology to a server.

The traditional approach is for a software infrastructure vendor to support a specific public or proprietary remote desktop display protocol which is native or installed on a server. To access the server using a remote desktop protocol a client typically needs to have a protocol specific software application that executes on the user s specific operating system and platform or plug in for a specific browser.

Conventional approaches are thus cumbersome to users. Accordingly there is a need for systems and methods that facilitate user interaction with an application running on a server from a client device and provide an improved experience for users at the client device.

Aspects of the present disclosure may provide utilizing a server that may provide one or more web browsers access to one or more remote machines through a remote desktop client. A server may include a module or functionality e.g. machine readable instructions to receive requests from a web browser. A sever may include a module or functionality e.g. machine readable instructions to translate user input requests received as HTTP requests from a web browser into corresponding input calls in a protocol language compatible with one or more remote desktop clients for accessing one or more remote machines. In one aspect a server can receive information data from e.g. drawing commands from one or more remote machines via the one or more remote desktop clients and translate the information data into a protocol language compatible with the associated web browser s . A server can include storage memory functionality for holding an image e.g. a Java or memory bitmap which can be modified in response to drawing commands received from the remote desktop server. A server may receive from the remote desktop server and store coordinates corresponding to the respective drawing commands. In certain aspects a server may comprise a web server e.g. a windows web server.

In some applications a server may facilitate accelerate rendering an image of the related remote desktop s at the related web browser by creating and modifying an image of the portion of the remote desktop that is affected by the user s input at the user device.

Aspects of the present disclosure may provide a web server with asynchronous request handling functionality to handle requests from a web browser.

Aspects of the present disclosure may provide a server with long polling functionality to handle requests from a web browser.

Aspects of the present disclosure may include or provide a web browser having a canvas or 2D rendering functionality.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

While certain embodiments are depicted in the drawings one skilled in the art will appreciate that the embodiments depicted are illustrative and that variations of those shown as well as other embodiments described herein may be envisioned and practiced within the scope of the present disclosure.

The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology. Like components are labeled with identical element numbers for ease of understanding.

Prior approaches using hypertext markup language HTML have required the use of browser specific plug ins as a method to create a better user experience by accelerating video and audio for example. Browser plug ins do not achieve HTML browser independence across the competing infrastructure vendors.

Infrastructure vendors are competing heavily in the proprietary remote desktop protocols and are focused on modest improvements over time to improve the user experience. The user experience while using a remote desktop protocol is a primary differentiator between the infrastructure vendors. There are however no known efforts to enable the user and customer to have a single unified method to have remote access to their home work or mobile Windows Mac or Linux environments.

In some aspects embodiments of the subject technology can eliminate or reduce the need for the installation of proprietary protocols on a user s device or a client device for accessing a remote machine during a remote desktop session. A remote machine or remotely accessed machine may include a remote desktop server. By enabling the user to use a single method to access their remote desktops with an open standard technology like HTML5 the requirements placed on a user s device e.g. a smart phone can be greatly reduced.

In some aspects embodiments of the subject technology can reduce or eliminate the need for installation of client software and or a browser plug in on the user s client device.

In some aspects embodiments of the subject technology can achieve a robust user experience that one would expect from a local executing application on a personal computing desktop.

In some aspects embodiments of the subject technology can advantageously utilize 2D rendering capability of suitable web browsers and replace proprietary rendering protocols with the 2D drawing capabilities of a browser running on the user s client device.

In some aspects embodiments of the subject technology can allow a user to easily access one or multiple open remote desktops across multiple servers and maintain their exact state from information stored in real time on an associated web server having protocol translation functionality that can function as a common interface between push type protocol employed by most remote desktop protocols and the pull type protocol employed by HTTP also referred to herein as a transcoding server which the user may access via a web browser having 2D rendering capability. Doing so can allow the user to render a remote display of a currently open session in a few seconds. Thus as the user switches from client device to client device the exact state of a particular remote desktop is preserved and is re rendered based on the capabilities of each display device. Effectively the user s multiple desktops can be configured to be always on and ready to be displayed on demand. The user s remote desktops can be configured to be accessed at any time and from any location.

Prior to the subject technology as described herein because HTTP a pull type protocol and most remote desktop display protocols push type protocols are incompatible it has generally been recognized by those skilled in the art that proprietary software and or downloadable plug ins were necessary for a web browser in order to have a remote desktop session using an HTTP on one end and a remote desktop display protocol on the other end.

In some aspects embodiments of the subject technology can enable a user of any endpoint device with a web browser having 2D rendering capabilities e.g. an HTML5 browser to display one or more remote desktop sessions in a single or multiple browser windows. Embodiments of the present disclosure can accordingly eliminate the need for installation on a client device of proprietary or open source client applications for remote desktop access. Embodiments of the present disclosure can establish and maintain simultaneous remote desktop connections to a single or multiple Windows Mac OS or Linux servers and enable all remote sessions to be displayed and interacted independently within the user s browser application. Embodiments of the present disclosure can be rendered in real time and be displayed as a web page on the remote client e.g. a user device such as a smart phone. All user mouse touch and keyboard input may be captured within the browser window and converted into the input format needed by the remote desktop machine which may utilize common desktop protocols e.g. independent computing architecture ICA by Citrix Systems remote desktop protocol RDP by Microsoft and PC over IP PCoIP by Taradici etc. Embodiments of the present disclosure can maintain open connections to the host servers at all times allowing single or multiple endpoint devices to be interactively connected and disconnected to the remote sessions instantly. Remote sessions never need to be disconnected from the servers as embodiments of the present disclosure can maintain active connections to the desktop. Active sessions can be resized and adjusted for best display and user experience to utilize the full capability of the user s access device.

In some aspects embodiments of the subject technology can reduce or eliminate the requirement for a local client application e.g. a web browser to support a vendor specific remote desktop protocol. Embodiments of the present disclosure can allow a browser with 2D rendering capability to run on any hardware any operating system and any form factor for the user to access her or his remote desktop or applications. A user can simply point the browser e.g. an HTML5 compatible browser such as Google Chrome to a respective predetermined uniform resource locator URL for one or more remote machines configured as remote desktop application servers. The browser can access a transcoding server that can translate or transcode between the protocol used for the browser and the protocol used for the remote machine s . The transcoding server can be public private cloud based and the access to the transcoding server can utilize HTTPS protocol. The transcoding server can authenticate the connection between the remote machine and a remote desktop client render the desktop of the remote machine s in real time and transmit that rendering to the browser via HTTP so that the browser can display the rendering in HTML5 canvas. Accordingly embodiments of the present disclosure can function as or provide a virtual desktop and application server that connects to one or multiple remote desktop servers e.g. Citrix XenDesktop with ICA Microsoft Windows Client and Server with RDP and VMware View with PCoIP etc.

Prior to HTML5 supporting canvas 2D real time drawing primitives HTML alone was not seen as a practical rendering technology due to the static nature of the rendered objects. As used according to the present disclosure HTML5 and similar browser languages can enable a new user robust experience due to the ability of rendering in 2D 3D and multimedia video audio objects on the client platform HTML5 can also in some cases utilize hardware acceleration for such rendering. Aspects of the subject technology can facilitate enhanced user experience for remote desktop sessions by providing platform independent techniques that allow real time access to remote machines and do not require the client device to have proprietary software or plug ins. Moreover the remote machines are not required to have HTTP or HTML compatibility for the remote desktop sessions.

As described herein aspects of the subject technology can reduce or minimize traffic between a browser and a transcoding server according the present disclosure. The reduction in traffic can be facilitated by various aspects of the subject technology including but not limited to implementation of long polling for drawing requests received from a web browser providing to a web browser only image portions from a remote desktop that have changed and need to be updated rather than the image of the entire remote desktop and placing coordinates for updated image portion s into a header of a single HTTP transmission response. The reduction of traffic to and from a browser can facilitate a remote desktop session that provides a real time user experience e.g. a user experience with few if any perceivable delays in the round trip time delay for user inputs to travel from a client device to the remote machine and a corresponding update of the remote desktop showing up on the client device. In exemplary embodiments such delay may be below e.g. 100 milliseconds so that most users will not perceive any delay at all.

As was noted previously aspects of the present disclosure can include or utilize a HTML5 compatible web browser having a 2D canvas e.g. in . The HTML5 specification provides for a 2D canvas which allows for dynamic real time scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. In one aspect being scriptable can mean or include reference to utilizing JavaScript for rendering a 2D image. The canvas consists of a drawable region defined in HTML code with height and width attributes. JavaScript code may access the area through a full set of drawing functions similar to other common 2D APIs thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics.

As shown in an overall architecture of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may contain three parts a client device or a user s device containing a browser e.g. an HTML5 compatible browser a server e.g. a Java web sever that is configured to function as a transcoding server translating between different protocols and a remote machine to which the client device is connecting. As shown and described for a transcoding server may include three main sections a remote desktop client wrapper or adapter a drawing commands queue and a web application container. The web application container can include various elements or components e.g. a hypertext transfer protocol HTTP handler a long polling handler and a drawing requests queue as shown and described with reference to . In an alternate embodiment a drawing commands queue may be a part of a web application container.

By way of illustration and not limitation in one aspect of the disclosure stated from a perspective of a remote machine side treating a remote machine as a local device and treating a client device as a remote device an application is executed or runs at a local device . While a client device may receive and display a view of the application on a display local to the client device the client device does not execute or run the application at the client device . Stated in another way from a perspective of the client side treating a remote machine as a remote device and treating a client device as a local device a remote application is executed or runs at a remote machine and while a client device may receive and display a view of the remote application the client device does not execute or run the remote application locally at the client device.

By way of illustration and not limitation a client device can represent a computer a mobile phone a laptop computer a thin client device a personal digital assistant PDA a portable computing device or a suitable device with a processor. In one example a client device may be a smartphone e.g. iPhone Android phone Blackberry etc. . In certain configurations a client device can represent an audio player a game console a camera a camcorder an audio device a video device a multimedia device or a device capable of supporting a connection to a remote server. In a preferred example a client device is mobile. In another example a client device can be stationary. According to one aspect of the disclosure a client device may be a device having at least a processor and memory where the total amount of memory of the client device could be less than the total amount of memory in a remote machine or a server . In one example a client device does not have a hard disk. In one aspect a client device has a display smaller than a display supported by a remote machine or a server . In one aspect a client device may include one or more client devices.

In one preferred aspect a server or a remote machine may represent a computer. In another aspect a server or a remote machine may represent a laptop computer a computing device a virtual machine e.g. VMware Virtual Machine a desktop session e.g. Microsoft Terminal Server a published application e.g. Microsoft Terminal Server or a suitable device with a processor. In one preferred example a server or a remote machine is stationary. In another aspect a server or a remote machine can be mobile. In certain configurations a server or a remote machine may be any device that can represent a client device. In one aspect a server may include one or more servers.

In one example a first device is remote to a second device when the first device is not directly connected to the second device. In one example a first remote device may be connected to a second device over a communication network such as a Local Area Network LAN a Wide Area Network WAN and or other network.

When a client device a server and a remote machine are remote with respect to one another a client device may connect to a server over a network and a remote machine may connect to a server over a network via a network connection for example a modem connection a LAN connection including the Ethernet or a broadband WAN connection including DSL Cable T1 T3 Fiber Optics Wi Fi or a mobile network connection including GSM GPRS 3G WiMax or other network connection. A network can be a LAN network a WAN network a wireless network the Internet an intranet or other network. A network may include one or more routers for routing data between client devices and or servers. A remote device e.g. client device server on a network may be addressed by a corresponding network address such as but not limited to an Internet protocol IP address an Internet name a Windows Internet name service WINS name a domain name or other system name. These illustrate some examples as to how one device may be remote to another device. However the subject technology is not limited to these examples.

According to certain aspects of the present disclosure the terms server and remote server are generally used synonymously in relation to a client device and the word remote may indicate that a server is in communication with other device s for example over a network connection s .

According to certain aspects of the present disclosure the terms client device and remote client device are generally used synonymously in relation to a server and or a remote machine and the word remote may indicate that a client device is in communication with a server s and or a remote machine s for example over a network connection s .

In one aspect of the disclosure a client device may be sometimes referred to as a client a user device a user s device or vice versa. Similarly a server may be sometimes referred to as a server device or vice versa. A server is sometimes referred to as a web server. Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure include use of web servers with transcoding functionality e.g. transcoding servers.

In one aspect the terms local and remote are relative terms and a client device may be referred to as a local client device or a remote client device depending on whether a client device is described from a client side or from a server side or a remote machine s side respectively. A remote machine may be referred to as a local machine or a remote machine depending on whether a remote machine is described from the remote machine s side or from a client or server side. Similarly a server may be referred to as a local server or a remote server depending on whether a server is described from a server side or from a client side or a remote machine s side respectively. Furthermore an application running on a remote machine may be referred to as a local application if described from a remote machine s side and may be referred to as a remote application if described from a client side or a server side.

In one aspect devices placed on a client side e.g. devices connected directly to a client device s or to one another using wires or a short range wireless connection e.g. Bluetooth may be referred to as local devices with respect to a client device and remote devices with respect to a server. Similarly devices placed on a server side e.g. devices connected directly to a server s or to one another using wires or a short range wireless connection e.g. Bluetooth may be referred to as local devices with respect to a server and remote devices with respect to a client device.

Transcoding server can include three main functional blocks or modules a web application container a remote desktop client adapter and a drawing commands queue that includes a shared memory. The web application container can include an HTTP handler for handling HTTP requests from the web browser and HTTP responses to the web browser. In some embodiments the web application container may also include a long polling handler module as shown. The remote desktop client adapter can be configured to interface with a remote desktop client e.g. from a third party vendor for communication with remote machine which may include a remote desktop server as shown. Embodiments of a transcoding server can be configured to provide an application framework for hosting one or more web applications and or function as a Java web application container that can run Servlets. In some aspects a remote desktop client adapter may be referred to as a remote desktop client common interface.

The remote desktop client may function to communicate with the remote desktop server of the remote machine using a remote desktop display protocol. The remote desktop client sends a user s input to the remote machine and receives drawing data from the remote machine via its specific remote desktop display protocol.

In one aspect a remote desktop server may refer to a software installed on a remote machine and a remote desktop server may allow applications particularly those including graphical applications which run on the remote machine to be displayed at a machine that is separate and distinct from the remote machine e.g. client devices . Remote desktop server may allow drawing commands representing an image of a desktop of the remote machine to be transmitted to the separate machine e.g. transcoding server . In one aspect remote desktop client may refer to software installed on the machine that is separate and distinct from the remote machine e.g. transcoding server . Remote desktop client may send requests to remote desktop server via a remote desktop display protocol and in response receive the drawing commands representing the image of the desktop of the remote machine via the remote desktop display protocol.

In operation the web application container can function to receive and respond to the JavaScript client s HTTP requests. In one implementation a Servlet container can be used but the same result can be achieved using any similar web application framework such as Restlet for example. The remote desktop client adapter may provide a common interface between any remote desktop client and the drawing commands queue the web application container.

The remote desktop client adapter may receive a user s input information data or commands e.g. mouse keyboard and touch events from HTTP handler and translate the input information commands into respective remote desktop input calls which are sometimes referred to as remote desktop input commands. The remote desktop client adapter may also translate the drawing commands of the remote desktop e.g. GDI drawing commands received from remote desktop server via a remote desktop display protocol and remote desktop client into Java graphics application programming interface API commands. Java graphics API commands in themselves are not suitable for the web browser but they are an intermediary step towards achieving browser compatibility. The remote desktop client adapter may then execute those Java graphics API commands i.e. drawing into an off screen Java bitmap which can be stored in the drawing commands queue . In an alternative embodiment the drawing commands queue e.g. of of may receive the Java graphics API commands from the remote desktop client adapter and execute the Java graphics API commands to draw into an off screen Java bitmap. The HTTP handler e.g. of of or image conversion module e.g. of of can create an image such as a joint photographic experts group JPEG image or a portable network graphics PNG image or a bit image file BMP image or any other image file in an image format suitable for web browsers from the Java off screen bitmap and the resulting image is suitable for the browser . In one aspect a JPEG image may be referred to as a JPEG image file and a PNG image may be referred to as a PNG image file and BMP image may be referred to as a BMP image file. In one aspect as the image e.g. a JPEG or PNG image is created in real time when it is created it is simply sent to the web browser without being stored at the transcoding server.

In one aspect the drawing commands queue can serve two purposes holding or storing the off screen Java bitmap onto which drawing commands are executed and holding or serving as a drawing coordinates pool e.g. a queue of coordinates for drawing commands. The drawing commands queue can for example store GDI drawing command coordinates received from the remote desktop client adapter. In the event there are new drawing coordinates in the queue the drawing commands queue may send a notification to long polling handler module e.g. can be sent so that any pending request in the drawing requests queue can be served . The drawing requests queue e.g. in can function to store incoming long polling drawing requests from the client and respond to them when there are pending drawing commands from the drawing commands queue.

In some embodiments the web application container may include a long polling handler module which includes a long polling handler and a drawing requests queue . The long polling handler can operate with drawing requests queue . The drawing requests queue can function to store incoming long polling drawing requests received from the client e.g. HTML5 compatible web browser such as web browser in via the long polling handler and respond to them when there are pending drawing commands from the drawing commands queue . In one aspect pending drawing commands may include coordinates for the image in dirty coordinates pool and or an image e.g. Java bitmap in the drawing commands queue .

In operation the web application container may receive and respond to HTTP requests from a web browser on a user device e.g. in in . The web application container may provide user input requests to the remote desktop client adapter which provides a common interface between the web application container and the remote desktop client . The remote desktop client adapter may translate user input information e.g. mouse keyboard and touch events into respective remote desktop input calls for the remote desktop client . The remote desktop client adapter may translate the drawing commands e.g. GDI drawing commands of an image of a remote desktop received from a remote machine e.g. in in via a remote desktop display protocol and the remote desktop client into Java graphics drawing commands.

After receiving and translating the drawing commands from the remote desktop client the remote desktop client adapter may draw into an off screen Java bitmap stored in the drawings commands queue as shown. More specifically the remote desktop client adapter may provide as an image the portion also referred to as the dirty region s of the remote desktop affected by the user s input from the user device. Along with the drawing commands the remote desktop client adapter may extract from the drawing command s coordinates of the dirty region s from the remote desktop client and provide the drawing coordinates to the drawing commands queue e.g. dirty coordinates pool as indicated. As explained later the coordinates can be placed into an HTTP header section e.g. by HTTP handler to send dirty region coordinates e.g. as cookie along with an image to a browser e.g. in for display.

In the event there are new drawing coordinates in the drawing commands queue e.g. in the dirty coordinates pool drawing commands queue may send a notification to the drawing requests queue so that any pending request in the drawing requests queue can be forwarded to the HTTP handler for serving. The HTTP handler may then reach to the drawing commands queue e.g. dirty coordinates pool and obtain the dirty coordinates from the dirty coordinates pool . The HTTP handler may then place the dirty coordinates into an HTTP header section known as a cookie . In addition according to those coordinates the HTTP handler may obtain an image portion from the Java off screen bitmap . The HTTP handler may then send the image e.g. as a JPEG image or a PNG image as well as the coordinates which are stored in an HTTP response header section to the web browser e.g. in for display at the user device s display e.g. in . As a result the transcoding server A can facilitate a remote desktop session between a user device e.g. in in and a remote machine e.g. in in without the need for the user device to utilize proprietary plug ins or protocols.

In one aspect an image or an image file and drawing coordinates sent by a transcoding server to a web browser may be considered as an example of web browser drawing updates. In a preferred aspect web browser drawing updates are compatible with the web browser so that the web browser can recognize the web browser drawing updates and process them to display an image at the appropriate location on a display. Web browser drawing updates may be implemented with other types of drawing data and commands.

In one aspect an HTTP protocol the requests of which may be handled with an HTTP handler and a long polling handler between a client device and a transcoding server is a pull protocol and a remote desktop display protocol utilized between a transcoding server and a remote machine is a push protocol.

Long polling is a modification of the traditional polling technique and can allow emulation of an information push from a server to a client. With long polling the client requests information from the server in a similar way to a normal poll. In the event the server does not have any information available for the client instead of sending an empty response the server holds the request and waits for some information to be available. Once the information becomes available or after a suitable timeout a complete response is sent to the client. The client can then immediately re request information from the server allowing the server to almost always have an available waiting request that it can use to deliver data in response to an event.

The script client code can include an input listener responsive to user inputs such as mouse keyboard and touch events. The input listener can send HTTP requests with the user inputs to a transcoding server e.g. server in of . The script client code may also include a load image function or module that includes an image onload handler which may extract drawing coordinates from the HTTP header e.g. from the portion known as a cookie draw the received image onto canvas and call the load image function again passing it its unique identification ID . An image on error handler and or image on abort handler may also be included in the load image function to handle loading errors. The handler may call the load image function . For remote desktop sessions the canvas can hold an image of the remote desktop of the remote machine e.g. of and the user device may display the image onto a display e.g. in in the viewable window of the browser e.g. .

As mentioned previously an HTML5 compatible browser can be used for exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. HTML5 includes or supports a canvas which allows for dynamic real time scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. In one aspect being scriptable can mean or include reference to utilizing JavaScript for rendering a 2D image. The canvas consists of a drawable region defined in HTML code with height and width attributes. JavaScript code may access the canvas region or area through a full set of drawing functions similar to other common 2D APIs thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics.

In operation such as accessing a remote machine e.g. in in during a remote desktop session the input listener may relay user inputs to the related transcoding server e.g. in in which interfaces with the remote machine by way of a remote desktop client and remote desktop client adapter e.g. in in . The script client code can also send a number of drawing requests as indicated by LoadImage 1 LoadImage 4 . As described previously the drawing requests can be handled by the related transcoding server as long polling requests.

When drawing commands are received from the remote desktop server via the remote desktop client the transcoding server may create modify an off screen image of the remote desktop and provide the actual image and related coordinates to the browser where the JavaScript client s image onload handler e.g. can then draw the image to the canvas in accordance with the coordinates extracted from the HTTP header e.g. cookie . In one aspect the image represents a portion of the entire image of the remote desktop that has been changed and thus the onload handler can receive and update a portion of the canvas based on the coordinates received instead of updating the entire canvas .

In one aspect a bitmap in a transcoding server e.g. Java off screen bitmap may include or represent a bitmap of an entire image of a remote desktop e.g. of . When a portion s of the image of the remote desktop is changed e.g. image portion in response to for example a user s input command or other changes by the remote machine the changed image portion s and its remote desktop coordinates may be provided as a remote desktop drawing command s to a remote desktop client adapter e.g. from a remote desktop server e.g. via a remote desktop client e.g. .

In one aspect the remote desktop client adapter may translate the remote desktop drawing command s into a graphics drawing command s generate coordinates corresponding to the remote desktop coordinates based on the graphics drawing commands and provide the coordinates into a pool e.g. . The remote desktop client adapter may execute the graphics drawing command s to draw into the bitmap or stated in another way to generate a bitmap portion s to update a portion s of the bitmap e.g. a portion s of according to the coordinates generated by the remote desktop client adapter. The updated portion s of the bitmap represents the changed image portion s of the remote desktop. In a preferred aspect the updated portion s of the bitmap is a portion of a Java off screen bitmap .

In one aspect an HTTP handler e.g. may form an image file corresponding to the updated portion s of the bitmap obtain the coordinates e.g. from for the image file and place the coordinates into a section of an HTTP header. The HTTP handler may then provide the image file and the coordinates to a web browser e.g. or more specifically to a script client code e.g. in a single HTTP response.

A canvas e.g. may store the entire image of a remote desktop e.g. of to be displayed on a display e.g. and then a portion s of the canvas may be updated when a portion s of the image of the remote desktop is changed during a remote desktop session. In this example when the script client code receives an image file and the coordinates corresponding to the changed portion s of the image of the remote desktop the script client code can update a portion of the canvas at canvas coordinates corresponding to the coordinates received from the HTTP handler so that the updated portion of the canvas represents the image contained in the image file.

Because drawing commands provided by a remote desktop client may include only those image portion s or region s of the remote desktop with corresponding coordinates that have been changed or updated relative to previous drawing commands the image provided to the canvas e.g. can accordingly be limited or minimized to include just the updated portion s of the remote desktop in exemplary embodiments. The updates on the remote desktop can be due to a user s input e.g. via a remote desktop session or caused by the remote machine itself e.g. a new indicated time from the system clock. Because the size of the image s provided to the canvas e.g. in response to drawing requests can be minimized the traffic for the remote session can be reduced or minimized facilitating a real time user experience for a remote desktop session.

In one example a remote desktop drawing command may comprise a drawing call such as gdi bitmap data top left width height 16 32 in which data may be a pointer to a memory location where the bitmap data is located. The parameters top left width height may represent the coordinates for the bitmap data. The parameter 16 may be the number of bits in red green blue RGB and the parameter 32 may be the number of bits in alpha red green blue ARGB . Thus this exemplary call indicates where the bitmap data for a portion of the image of the remote desktop e.g. the portion that has been changed is located the coordinates for the bitmap data and the number of bits used to convert from an RGB format to an ARGB format.

In another example a graphics drawing command may comprise a drawing call such as draw rect color top left width height . This drawing call can draw a rectangle at the coordinates specified by top left width height using the specified color. 

In one aspect when long polling is utilized between a client device and a transcoding server that uses HTTP a pull protocol traffic to the client device can be reduced to a level experienced by a push type protocol.

The user input handler may transmit the input command to a remote desktop client which may transmit the input command to a remote desktop server . For example user input handler may facilitate transmitting the input command to remote desktop server via remote desktop client that communicates with remote desktop server using the remote desktop display protocol. In one aspect an input request is sometimes referred to as a user input command and vice versa. Please note however if an input request is referred to as an input command when it is received via HTTP it is a HTTP request rather than a command. In one aspect an input command is sometimes referred to as an input call or a remote desktop input command and vice versa.

A remote machine e.g. its remote desktop server may execute one or more actions based on the input command and send drawing data as a result of the executed one or more actions to a server such as a transcoding server A or B e.g. a remote desktop client of the server . According to various aspects a remote desktop client can receive a screen drawing command transmitted from a remote machine e.g. its remote desktop server utilizing the remote desktop display protocol in response to the input command transmitted to remote machine e.g. its remote desktop server . In one aspect a screen drawing command received from a remote machine may be sometimes referred to as a drawing command a remote machine drawing command or a remote desktop drawing command received from a remote machine and vice versa.

In one aspect Java graphics API command is sometimes referred to as Java graphics command or Java graphics drawing command. In one aspect the off screen bitmap may be a storage or memory location that is a part of a drawing commands queue e.g. or accessible by an application container e.g. or . In one aspect the size of an off screen bitmap may represent the size of a remote session. Stated in another way the size of an off screen bitmap may represent the size of the remote desktop or an off screen bitmap may be a bitmap representation of an entire image of a remote desktop.

Preferred embodiments of the present disclosure may in essence translate a request in HTTP to a command in a remote desktop display protocol and vice versa e.g. translate requests responses transmitted received via HTTP to commands transmitted received via a remote desktop display protocol and vice versa for a remote session between a client device and a remote machine. For example the input request from the web browser such as a server A B may be translated into the input command e.g. a remote desktop input command that is suitable for or compatible with the remote desktop display protocol and is received by remote desktop server via remote desktop client . The screen drawing command transmitted from the remote machine e.g. in response to the input command utilizing the remote desktop display protocol may be translated into the graphics drawing command that is compatible with the server A or B such as a Java graphics abstract window toolkit API command. In some aspects HTTP is a pull protocol while a remote desktop display protocol may be a push protocol. In some aspects a drawing command in push protocol may be translated into a drawing update or a drawing response in pull protocol during a remote session between a client device and a remote machine.

With continued reference to a drawing command handler when drawing into the off screen bitmap may transmit pixel data to the off screen bitmap. In some aspects the pixel data is used to update a portion of the off screen bitmap e.g. an off screen Java bitmap . In some aspects a drawing command handler may transmit the pixel data to the off screen bitmap so that the updated portion of the off screen bitmap may be stored and or converted to an image file.

According to certain aspects a drawing command handler can generate one or more coordinates corresponding to the updated portion of the off screen bitmap e.g. an image drawn into the off screen bitmap when the graphics drawing command is executed . For example the one or more coordinates may identify the locations where the corresponding image bitmap is to be executed on the canvas of a web browser. In one example the one or more coordinates may be extracted or copied from the graphics drawing command. A drawing command handler may also transmit the one or more coordinates to a dirty coordinates pool in that is a part of a drawing commands queue e.g. or . In some aspects a drawing command handler may transmit the one or more coordinates to the dirty coordinates pool so that the one or more coordinates may be stored in the dirty coordinates pool. Thus a drawing command handler may update dirty region coordinates in the drawing commands queue. In some aspects a drawing command handler may transmit a notification signal to a drawing requests queue e.g. in of a web application container e.g. . In some aspects the notification signal message may indicate that the image bitmap e.g. the off screen Java bitmap has been updated.

As shown at the bottom of the diagram e.g. at and the web browser can provide user input requests as HTTP requests to the transcoding server which in turn e.g. at and can provide the user input commands to the remote machine e.g. for control of the remote desktop of the remote machine. At the remote machine can provide drawing commands one command is shown to the drawing commands queue e.g. or in the transcoding server by way of the remote desktop client adapter e.g. or which draws a corresponding image of the remote desktop into the off screen bitmap in the drawing commands queue. In response to the drawing command the drawing commands queue can provide at notification to the drawing requests queue e.g. in the long polling handler module e.g. of the transcoding server. In response the first pending drawing request can be taken from the drawing requests queue and provided to the HTTP handler. In response at and the HTTP handler may obtain the image from the drawing commands queue. At the HTTP handler may provide the image and corresponding coordinates in a response sent to the script client e.g. or or more specifically of the web browser. The script client may then at draw the image e.g. to the canvas e.g. or using the appropriate coordinates extracted from the cookie for displaying the remote desktop in the web browser.

In one aspect an HTTP handler e.g. is a standard HTTP handler in that when it receives a request from a web browser it responds without waiting or storing the request. For example when an HTTP handler receives a user input request as a HTTP request at or from a web browser the HTTP handler responds immediately with a null response at and respectively while the request is sent to the remote machine via a remote desktop client adapter . In one aspect a long polling handler e.g. may be used to receive a request and respond to it based on an event and a long polling request may be stored. For example under one condition e.g. a drawing command is pending then the request is responded immediately e.g. the polling handler sends the drawing request to the HTTP handler so that the HTTP handler can send a response to the drawing request immediately. Under another condition e.g. a drawing command is not pending then the request may be stored away e.g. into a drawing requests queue until a condition is satisfied e.g. a new drawing command has arrived at a drawing commands queue .

In one aspect a remote desktop is a desktop of a remote machine. In one aspect during a remote desktop session with a remote machine a web browser of a client device may access control and or view any or all applications and files resident on the remote machine. In another aspect during a remote desktop session with a remote machine depending on the user s credentials and settings a web browser may be allowed to access control and or view some of the applications and files resident on the remote machine.

In one preferred aspect each of a client device a transcoding server and a remote machine is a separate and distinct machine that is remote from one another. In one aspect a transcoding server may be a machine that can communicate with one or more client devices and one or more remote machines and a transcoding server may be a machine that can communicate over a web. In one aspect a web browser may be an application that allows a user to retrieve present or communicate information over a web.

In high level description a web server can include two main functional blocks or modules a web application such as a model view controller MVC application of the ASP.NET framework and a remote desktop client wrapper . The web application can include an HTTP handler e.g. an asynchronous HTTP handler such as an HTTP controller of the ASP.NET MVC for handling HTTP requests e.g. HTTP initial connection requests HTTP input requests and HTTP drawing updates requests from the web browser and HTTP responses to the web browser . The HTTP handler may handle HTTP requests synchronously or asynchronously. A synchronous handling involves an immediate response that is provided in the order of receiving a request that needs immediate attention whereas the asynchronous handling may involve an immediate response or a delayed response depending on the nature of the request. For example the response to a synchronous request including an initial connection request or an input request e.g. user input events such as mouse keyboard or touch events is a synchronous response and a response to an asynchronous request including a drawing update request is an asynchronous response which may be immediate if there are changes in the remote desktop that needs immediate attention or delayed if there are no changes in the remote desktop. In the asynchronous case the browser after making the request may engage in other activities while waiting for the asynchronous response from the web server.

The remote desktop client wrapper can be configured to interface with a remote desktop client not shown in for simplicity e.g. from a third party vendor for communication with the remote machine which may include a remote desktop server as shown. Embodiments of the web server can be configured to provide an application framework for hosting one or more web applications and or function as a windows web application container that can run windows API. In some aspects a remote desktop client wrapper may be referred to as a remote desktop client common interface. The desktop client wrapper may function to communicate with the remote desktop server of the remote machine using a remote desktop display protocol. The remote desktop client may communicate remote desktop protocol data for example send a user s input to the remote machine and receive drawing data from the remote machine via its specific remote desktop display protocol.

In one aspect a remote desktop server may refer to a software installed on the remote machine and a remote desktop server may allow applications particularly those including graphical applications which run on the remote machine to be displayed at a machine that is separate and distinct from the remote machine e.g. on display of the client device using web browser . Remote desktop server may allow drawing commands representing an image of a desktop of the remote machine to be transmitted to the separate machine via the web server . In one aspect remote desktop client wrapper may refer to software installed on the machine that is separate and distinct from the remote machine e.g. web server . Remote desktop client wrapper may send requests to remote desktop server via a remote desktop display protocol and in response receive the drawing commands representing the image of the desktop of the remote machine via the remote desktop display protocol.

With regard to drawing requests if there are pending drawing commands the HTTP request switch may handle the request synchronously by passing the drawing request to the HTTP handler response ready module for completing the pending requests. Otherwise the drawing request may be handled asynchronously by adding the drawing request to the drawing requests queue . In one aspect pending drawing commands may include coordinates for the image in a drawing coordinates queue and or an image e.g. memory bitmap in the drawing commands buffer . In an aspect a windows bitmap may refer to a windows Graphics API memory bitmap which in one aspect may refer to a memory bitmap or an off screen bitmap. The HTTP handler response ready module can handle sending HTTP responses back to the client web browser e.g. in . In one aspect the HTTP handler response ready module is a standard HTTP handler. The drawing requests queue can function to store incoming HTTP drawing requests received by the HTTP request switch from the client e.g. HTML5 compatible web browser such as web browser in and respond to them when there are pending drawing commands from the drawing commands buffer . The drawing commands buffer can serve two purposes holding or storing an off screen image e.g. memory bitmap onto which drawing commands are executed and serving as the drawing coordinates queue e.g. a queue of coordinates for drawing commands. The coordinates can be those of regions or areas of an image of the remote desktop that need to be redrawn at the client device to reflect changes on the remote desktop. The areas or regions are sometimes referred to as drawing regions. The drawings commands buffer can function as memory or storage that is accessible by both the asynchronous HTTP handler and the remote desktop client wrapper .

The remote desktop client wrapper can be configured to interface with any suitable remote desktop client for communication with a remote machine e.g. in which may be configured to include a remote desktop server e.g. in . The remote desktop client wrapper may translate user input information e.g. mouse keyboard and touch events into respective remote desktop input calls for the remote desktop client . The remote desktop client wrapper may translate the drawing commands e.g. GDI drawing commands of an image of a remote desktop received from a remote machine e.g. in in via a remote desktop display protocol and the remote desktop client into windows graphics drawing commands.

After receiving and translating the drawing commands from the remote desktop client the remote desktop client wrapper may draw into an off screen memory bitmap stored in the drawings commands buffer as shown. More specifically the remote desktop client wrapper may provide as an image a portion of drawing regions of the remote desktop affected by the user s input from the user device. Along with the drawing commands the remote desktop client wrapper may extract from the drawing command s coordinates of the drawing region s from the remote desktop client and provide the drawing coordinates to the drawing commands buffer e.g. drawing coordinates queue as indicated. The coordinates can be placed into an HTTP header section e.g. by HTTP handler response ready module to send drawing region coordinates e.g. as cookie along with an image to a browser e.g. in for display.

In the event there are new drawing coordinates in the drawing commands buffer e.g. in the drawing coordinates queue drawing commands buffer may send a notification to the drawing requests queue so that any pending request in the drawing requests queue can be forwarded to the HTTP handler response ready module for serving. The HTTP handler response ready module may then reach to the drawing commands buffer e.g. drawing coordinates queue and obtain the drawing coordinates from the drawing coordinates queue . The HTTP handler response ready module may then place the drawing coordinates into an HTTP header section known as a cookie . In addition according to those coordinates the HTTP handler response ready module may obtain an image portion from the off screen memory bitmap . The HTTP handler response ready module may then send the image e.g. as a joint photographic experts group JPEG image or a portable network graphics PNG image as well as the coordinates which are stored in an HTTP response header section to the web browser e.g. in for display at the user device s display. As a result the web application can facilitate a remote desktop session between a user device e.g. in in and a remote machine e.g. in in . or in without the need for the user device to utilize proprietary plug ins or protocols.

In one aspect an image or an image file such as a windows image file and drawing coordinates sent by a web server e.g. a windows web server to a windows web browser may be considered as an example of web browser drawing updates. In a preferred aspect web browser drawing updates are compatible with the windows web browser so that the windows web browser can recognize the web browser drawing updates and process them to display an image at the appropriate location on a display. Web browser drawing updates may be implemented with other types of drawing data and commands.

In one aspect an HTTP protocol the requests of which may be handled with HTTP request switch and HTTP handler response ready module between a client device and a web server is a pull protocol and a remote desktop display protocol utilized between a web server and a remote machine is a push protocol.

The remote desktop client wrapper may receive a user s input information data or commands e.g. mouse keyboard and touch events from HTTP request switch and translate the input information commands into respective remote desktop input calls which are sometimes referred to as remote desktop input commands. The remote desktop client wrapper may also translate the drawing commands of the remote desktop e.g. GDI drawing commands received from a remote desktop server e.g. remote desktop server of via a remote desktop display protocol and remote desktop client into windows graphics application programming interface API commands. Windows graphics API commands in themselves are not suitable for the web browser but they are an intermediary step towards achieving browser compatibility. The remote desktop client wrapper may then execute those windows graphics API commands i.e. drawing into an off screen memory bitmap which can be stored in the drawing commands buffer . In an alternative embodiment the drawing commands buffer may receive the windows graphics API commands from the remote desktop client wrapper and execute the windows graphics API commands to draw into an off screen memory bitmap. The HTTP handler response ready module can create an image such as a JPEG image or PNG image or a bitmap file BMP image or any other image file in an image format suitable for a browser e.g. a windows web browsers from the memory off screen bitmap and the resulting image is suitable for the browser of . In one aspect as the image e.g. a JPEG or PNG image is created in real time when it is created it is simply sent to the web browser without being stored at the web server. In one aspect a web server may comprise a web application. In one aspect a web application may be a part of a web server. In one aspect a web application may refer to a web server. In one aspect an asynchronous HTTP handler may be a part of a web application. In one aspect an asynchronous HTTP handler may refer to a web application. In an aspect a web server may be a windows web server. In one aspect a browser may be a windows web browser.

The script client code can include an input listener responsive to user inputs such as mouse keyboard and touch events. The input listener can send HTTP requests with the user inputs to a web server e.g. a web server of web application in . The script client code may also include a load image function or module that can handle HTTP image requests asynchronously on the web server and includes an image onload handler which may extract drawing coordinates from the HTTP header e.g. from the portion known as a cookie draw the received image onto canvas and call the load image function again passing it its unique identification ID . An image on error handler and or image on abort handler may also be included in the load image function to handle loading errors. The on abort handler may call the load image function . For remote desktop sessions the canvas can hold an image of the remote desktop of the remote machine e.g. of and the user device may display the image onto a display e.g. in in the viewable window of a browser e.g. .

As mentioned previously an HTML5 compatible browser can be used for exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. HTML5 includes or supports a canvas which allows for dynamic real time scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. In one aspect being scriptable can mean or include reference to utilizing a script for rendering a 2D image. The canvas consists of a drawable region defined in HTML code with height and width attributes. Script codes may access the canvas region or area through a full set of drawing functions similar to other common 2D APIs thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics.

In operation such as accessing a remote machine e.g. of during a remote desktop session the input listener may relay user inputs to the related web server e.g. or which interfaces with the remote machine by way of a remote desktop client and remote desktop client wrapper e.g. in . The script client code can also send a number of drawing requests as indicated by LoadImage 1 LoadImage 4 .

When drawing commands are received from the remote desktop server via the remote desktop client the web server may create modify an off screen image of the remote desktop and provide the actual image and related coordinates to the browser where the client s image onload handler e.g. can then draw the image to the canvas in accordance with the coordinates extracted from the HTTP header e.g. cookie . In one aspect the image represents a portion of the entire image of the remote desktop that has been changed and thus the onload handler can receive and update a portion of the canvas based on the coordinates received instead of updating the entire canvas .

In one aspect a bitmap in a web server e.g. memory bitmap may include or represent a bitmap of an entire image of a remote desktop e.g. of . When a portion s of the image of the remote desktop is changed e.g. image portion in response to for example a user s input command or other changes by the remote machine the changed image portion s and its remote desktop coordinates may be provided as a remote desktop drawing command s to a remote desktop client wrapper e.g. of from a remote desktop server e.g. via a remote desktop client.

In one aspect the remote desktop client wrapper may translate the remote desktop drawing command s into a graphics drawing command s generate coordinates corresponding to the remote desktop coordinates based on the graphics drawing commands and provide the coordinates into a queue e.g. of . The remote desktop client wrapper may execute the graphics drawing command s to draw into the bitmap or stated in another way to generate a bitmap portion s to update a portion s of the bitmap e.g. a portion s of according to the coordinates generated by the remote desktop client wrapper. The updated portion s of the bitmap represents the changed image portion s of the remote desktop. In a preferred aspect the updated portion s of the bitmap is a portion of memory bitmap .

In one aspect an HTTP handler response ready module e.g. of may form an image file corresponding to the updated portion s of the bitmap obtain the coordinates e.g. from for the image file and place the coordinates into a section of an HTTP header. The HTTP handler may then provide the image file and the coordinates to a web browser e.g. or more specifically to a script client code e.g. in a single HTTP response.

A canvas e.g. may store the entire image of a remote desktop e.g. of to be displayed on a display e.g. and then a portion s of the canvas may be updated when a portion s of the image of the remote desktop is changed during a remote desktop session. In this example when the script client code receives an image file and the coordinates corresponding to the changed portion s of the image of the remote desktop the script client code can update a portion of the canvas at canvas coordinates corresponding to the coordinates received from the HTTP handler so that the updated portion of the canvas represents the image contained in the image file.

Because drawing commands provided by a remote desktop client may include only those image portion s or region s of the remote desktop with corresponding coordinates that have been changed or updated relative to previous drawing commands the image provided to the canvas e.g. can accordingly be limited or minimized to include just the updated portion s of the remote desktop in exemplary embodiments. The updates on the remote desktop can be due to a user s input e.g. via a remote desktop session or caused by the remote machine itself e.g. a new indicated time from the system clock. Because the size of the image s provided to the canvas e.g. in response to drawing requests can be minimized the traffic for the remote session can be reduced or minimized facilitating a real time user experience for a remote desktop session.

As discussed above a remote desktop drawing command may comprise a drawing call such as gdi bitmap data top left width height 16 32 in which data may be a pointer to a memory location where the bitmap data is located. The parameters top left width height may represent the coordinates for the bitmap data. The parameter 16 may be the number of bits in red green blue RGB and the parameter 32 may be the number of bits in alpha red green blue ARGB . Thus this exemplary call indicates where the bitmap data for a portion of the image of the remote desktop e.g. the portion that has been changed is located the coordinates for the bitmap data and the number of bits used to convert from an RGB format to an ARGB format. In another example a graphics drawing command may comprise a drawing call such as draw rect color top left width height . This drawing call can draw a rectangle at the coordinates specified by top left width and height using the specified color. 

According to various aspects of the subject technology the remote desktop session module may be configured to receive a connection request e.g. an HTTP request specifying a particular remote machine indirectly from a web browser e.g. of via the asynchronous HTTP handler e.g. in . In some aspects a connection request may be received from a web browser via an HTTP request switch e.g. of that communicates with the web browser. In some aspects a remote desktop session module may manage or facilitate establishing a remote desktop session between a remote desktop client e.g. a remote desktop protocol client and a remote desktop server in response to the connection request. For example a remote desktop session module may manage or facilitate starting the remote desktop session passing credentials settings preferences etc. to a remote desktop server e.g. via a remote desktop client and stopping the remote desktop session.

In one aspect a remote desktop session module may receive a connection request e.g. a request originated from a web browser to establish a connection with remote desktop server e.g. or . In response to the connection request the remote desktop session module may generate session control commands that are compatible with the remote desktop client remote desktop server and the remote desktop display protocol e.g. session control commands that can be understood and processed by remote desktop client and remote desktop server and that can be transmitted and received by remote desktop client and remote desktop server utilizing the remote desktop display protocol. These session control commands may include a command for starting a remote desktop session a command for stopping the remote desktop session. The session control commands may include one or more of credentials settings preferences etc. and command s for passing credentials settings preferences etc. to remote desktop server e.g. . In response to the connection HTTP request the remote desktop session module may provide the appropriate session control command s generated by the remote desktop session module to the remote desktop client e.g. . The remote desktop client may then use the session control commands received from the remote desktop session module to start a remote desktop session with the remote desktop server pass credentials settings preferences etc. to remote desktop server and stop the remote desktop session.

In one aspect a remote desktop session module can translate a connection request that is not compatible with a remote desktop client a remote desktop server or a remote desktop display protocol e.g. that cannot be understood or processed by a remote desktop client a remote desktop server or a remote desktop display protocol into session control commands that are compatible with the remote desktop client the remote desktop server and the remote desktop display protocol i.e. that can be understood and processed by remote desktop client and remote desktop server and that can be communicated between remote desktop client and remote desktop server utilizing the remote desktop display protocol .

In some aspects facilitating an establishment of a remote desktop session between a remote desktop client and a remote desktop server comprises generating a session control command based on the initial HTTP request. In some aspects facilitating an establishment of the remote desktop session comprises transmitting the session control command from a remote desktop session module to a remote desktop client and then from the remote desktop client to a remote desktop server e.g. . For example the session control command may be transmitted to the remote desktop server via the remote desktop client that communicates with remote desktop server using a remote desktop display protocol. In some aspects the remote desktop display protocol comprises at least one of the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol RDP personal computer over internet protocol PCoIP remote FX RFX protocol remote framebuffer RFB protocol independent computing architecture ICA NX protocol and other suitable remote desktop display protocols. In some aspects the RFB protocol comprises virtual network computing VNC .

According to certain aspects of the subject technology a server such as server A B e.g. via a remote desktop session module can maintain open connections between its remote desktop client and one or more remote desktop servers at all times allowing single or multiple client devices to be interactively connected and disconnected to remote desktop sessions instantly. In some aspects remote desktop sessions may never need to be disconnected from the one or more remote desktop servers as a server can maintain active connections to the one or more remote desktop servers. Of course a remote machine e.g. may go down for reasons that are outside of a related web server s control however the connection can be maintained as long as the remote machine is available for remote access. For example a remote desktop session module may continuously maintain the remote desktop session until the remote desktop server disconnects from the remote desktop session depending on the remote desktop server s idle remote connection settings. In some aspects remote desktop sessions established utilizing a remote desktop session module may be resized and adjusted for best display and user experience to utilize the full capability of the client devices.

According to various aspects of the subject technology a user input module may receive an input request indirectly from a web browser such as a web browser e.g. via an HTTP request switch of and convert the input request into a format recognized by and or compatible with remote desktop client and remote desktop server . For example user input module receives an input request that was transmitted utilizing a request response protocol from a web browser. In preferred aspects the request response protocol may comprise hypertext transfer protocol HTTP . In another aspect the request response protocol may comprise other suitable request response protocols.

Referring to and continuing with the description of method drawing commands and coordinates e.g. of dirty regions can be received by the transcoding server from the remote desktop server as described at . In response the drawing commands and coordinates can be translated from the protocol of the remote desktop server to the protocol of the web browser as described at . The transcoding server can respond by drawing or generating an image of the remote desktop as described at . The image and the corresponding coordinates can be linked or unionized as described at . A drawing request from the web browser can be responded to as described at by sending the image and coordinates to the web browser for display as described at . Accordingly method may be used for controlling and accessing a remote desktop session via HTTP and such control can be in real time.

An exemplary embodiment of a method of accessing and controlling a remote desktop of a remote machine e.g. or from a web browser e.g. or via a transcoding server e.g. A or B may include the following three steps step one can happen once at the beginning of a session and steps two and three can continue interchangeably during the remote desktop session.

The first step can include an initial HTTP request by the web browser e.g. a connection request to connect to a remote machine . For example an initial HTTP request is sent by the web browser preferably an HTML5 compatible browser. The web browser receives back a response which can contain a script client such as or e.g. JavaScript Ajax client code. The transcoding server e.g. Java transcoding server can use the connection request to establish a connection to a remote machine via a remote desktop client. A remote desktop client on or used with the Java transcoding server can establish the connection to a remote machine which utilizes a remote desktop display protocol. The transcoding server can function to interface between the HTTP protocol and the remote desktop display protocol. In one aspect between the web browser and the transcoding server there is no connection as HTTP is a connectionless protocol. Instead there are only separate requests and responses in HTTP protocol.

The second step is remote session drawing at the web browser On the browser side the client JavaScript code can continuously re send a number of e.g. four asynchronous Ajax HTTP requests to find out if there are any dirty regions of the remote desktop of the remote machine to re draw. On the Java transcoding server these drawing requests are handled as long polling requests meaning that they will be responded to only if there is data to be drawn otherwise they hang in the drawing requests queue e.g. . In addition on the Java transcoding server the remote session is drawn into an off screen Java bitmap in a drawing commands queue of the transcoding server. In addition the coordinates of the drawing command are also appended or added to the drawing commands queue. This last part also sends a notification to the drawing requests queue of the transcoding server so that the first waiting request from the drawing requests queue can be served. In HTTP response to the browser the dirty drawing image is sent together with the drawing coordinates that are stored in one of the HTTP header sections known as a cookie . On the browser side the script client receives the dirty image and the coordinates and the script client draws the image into an HTML canvas e.g. using coordinates from the cookie. This allows the remote session from a remote machine e.g. an image of the remote desktop of the remote machine to be drawn via a Java transcoding server to the client s HTML5 browser.

The third step involves a user input such as a mouse click keystroke or touch event. On the browser side the script client detects e.g. a mouse event and sends an HTTP request to the transcoding server passing along the X and Y coordinates of the event. The Java transcoding server receives the request sends an empty reply see e.g. and in to close the HTTP request and then via remote desktop client adapter it forwards this request to the remote desktop client which sends it via its protocol to the remote machine. These user input requests can be handled in a standard way i.e. not as long polling events to receive and process user input. User input can then be sent to the remote machine.

In a preferred aspect a script client is not installed on the client device. In other words a script client does not exist and is not pre installed on the web browser or on the client device prior to the first step described above e.g. prior to the web browser connecting to or sending a request to connect to the transcoding server to initiate a remote session with a remote machine . In a preferred aspect a client device simply needs a web browser to initiate accessing and controlling a remote desktop of a remote machine or to initiate a remote desktop session with the remote machine. Thus the client device does not need software or a browser plug in for a remote desktop display protocol. The transcoding server provides the script client in real time to the web browser via HTTP once the web browser requests a connection to a remote machine for a remote desktop session. The web browser s connection to the remote machine is established through the transcoding server and the script client is deleted from the client device and the web browser when the remote desktop session is terminated or the browser is closed.
