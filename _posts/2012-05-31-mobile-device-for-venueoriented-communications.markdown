This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 493 194 titled SYSTEMS AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING MULTIPLE AUDIO STREAMS IN A VENUE filed Jun. 3 2011 and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This application relates generally to venue oriented communications and more specifically to systems and methods for providing one or more venue oriented services such as for example the distribution of multiple audio streams.

On both satellite and cable television distribution systems numerous sports programs and events as well as other audio video content of interest may be transmitted and presented simultaneously over different broadcast channels. Given the varying interest of potential patrons some public establishments such as bars sports books and the like may provide multiple televisions video monitors projection systems and similar audio video devices to provide many different such programs concurrently for the enjoyment of their clientele. Ordinarily these devices are placed in relatively close proximity to each other or are placed in the same large room so any patron of the establishment may view any of multiple video devices without changing locations within the establishment.

However given such an arrangement of the audio video devices within the establishment allowing each of the audio video devices or some related devices to produce the audio for each program being displayed is impractical due to the confusing and likely unintelligible sounds that would result. To prevent such confusion in some situations the audio associated with a single one of the programs being shown may be produced such as the sound associated with the most popular program or event being presented in the establishment at the time. Additionally in some cases one or more of the audio video devices may be placed in a closed captioning mode in which text reflecting the words spoken by sports announcers or others associated with the program is displayed on the screen to provide at least some reflection of the program audio to the patrons viewing that program.

Example methods and systems for distribution of multiple audio signals are discussed. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. It will also be evident that the venues and environments described herein in which audio signal distribution may occur are not limited to the examples provided and may include other scenarios not specifically discussed.

In accordance with an example embodiment illustrates an audio distribution system . Generally the audio distribution system is configured to provide multiple streams of audio content to at least one mobile device . In an example the audio distribution system may be located at a particular venue. In some implementations the venue may be a public venue such as a restaurant a drinking establishment or a race and sports book. In such a venue each of multiple audio video output devices such as televisions video monitors video projectors and the like may present one of a number of sporting events or other audio video programs to customers or viewers located at the venue. To allow the patrons of the venue to receive the audio portion being received by one of the output devices the audio distribution system makes available the audio from the output devices to one or more mobile communication devices held or possessed by patrons of the establishment. Examples of the mobile communication devices include but are not limited to cellular smart phones personal digital assistants PDAs laptop computers and tablet computers. In some implementations each of the mobile communication devices may be owned and operated by its respective user or may be loaned or rented by operators of the venue to the users.

In an example of the audio distribution system each of the audio video output devices generating an audio signal that is desired to be distributed to users located at the venue may be communicatively coupled with a converter device or alternatively an audio relay device which may convert or otherwise transfer or relay the audio signal from its corresponding output device to a digital audio stream . Each converter device may transmit its converted digital audio stream to one or more access devices . The access device distributes the received digital audio streams as one or more wireless digital audio streams to the mobile communication devices . In one example one or more of the converter devices may be integrated with each other and or with one or more of the access devices .

A user of each mobile communication device may then select one of the digital audio streams represented in the wireless digital audio stream for reception and presentation at the mobile communication device of the user. The user may then listen to the selected audio stream or channel such as by way of a speaker incorporated into the mobile communication device an earphone or headset connected to the mobile communication device a Bluetooth enabled audio device communicatively coupled with the mobile communication device or the like. As a result each user possessing one of the mobile communication devices may select and enjoy the audio portion of the audio video content presented by way of one of the output devices .

In some examples as is discussed in greater detail below the audio distribution system may also be employed as a communication conduit for offering one or more services associated with the venue the audio video content being presented via the output devices or some other entity. These services may include but are not limited to chat rooms involving users of other mobile devices advertising and sales associated with the venue or other entities customer loyalty programs associated with the venue or another entity social networking services involving other users of other mobile devices and gaming or wagering services associated with the venue or another entity. Such services may be organized and provided across the entire system or according to some subdivision of the system such as according to venue or access device . In some examples this functionality may be provided directly by the access device or in conjunction with a communication node such as an information server communicatively coupled with the access device by way of a communication network . Examples of the communication network may include but are not limited to a wide area network WAN such as an Intranet the Internet or some portion thereof a local area network LAN and an IEEE 802.11x WiFi network. Also while the communication node and the communication network are shown as being located external to the venue the communication node and the network may be located completely or partially within the venue in other examples.

The analog audio receiver may be configured to receive an analog audio signal from one of the audio video output devices . In one example the analog audio signal is carried by way of a wire cable optical fiber or other wired means from a standard analog audio out connector of the corresponding output device to the converter device . In another implementation the analog out connector may be attached to a wireless transmitter to carry the analog audio stream as an analog or digital wireless signal to the converter device . Other methods and apparatus for carrying the audio stream to the converter device may be employed in other embodiments. In yet further examples the audio stream generated by the audio video output device may be digital in nature in which case the converter device may or may not be required in order to present a corresponding digital audio stream to the access device of .

In some implementations the converter device may include multiple analog audio receivers to receive audio content from multiple audio video output devices simultaneously. Such multiple analog audio signals may be converted and then combined into a single digital audio stream or multiple digital audio streams for transmission to the access device of .

Presuming the audio stream is an analog audio signal the analog audio receiver receives the audio signal and provides the signal to the conversion module . In one example the analog audio receiver includes an automatic gain control AGC function to adjust the gain of an amplifier of the analog audio receiver to provide a somewhat consistent signal level for the input to the conversion module . In some instances the analog audio receiver may incorporate other functionality such as lag reduction and network optimization logic.

The conversion module may then convert the received analog audio signal to a digital audio signal. In one example the conversion module includes at least one analog to digital conversion ADC circuit that samples the analog audio stream at a sufficiently high rate to generate a digital audio stream of acceptable quality for presentation on at least one of the mobile communication devices . In one implementation the conversion module may also include audio compression logic or circuitry that compresses the digital audio data before transmission of the data to the access device . As a result the resulting digital audio data may be in a compressed format such as Motion Picture Experts Group 1 Audio Layer III MP3 or Ogg or an uncompressed format depending on the particular embodiment.

The digital audio stream generated by the conversion module is then forwarded to the digital audio transmitter for transmission to the access device of as the digital audio stream . In one example the digital audio stream is transmitted over a wire cable optical fiber or the like to the access device . In one example the digital audio stream is transmitted via an Ethernet connection or network to the access device . More specifically the converter device may be attached to an Ethernet network as a network appliance along with other converter devices for communicative coupling with the access device . Thus the digital audio transmitter may serve as an Ethernet transceiver that may possess a number of network configuration capabilities including but not limited to dynamic and or static Internet Protocol IP addressing Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP functionality User Datagram Protocol UDP functionality possibly including a checksum calculated by the user of a UDP pseudo header and or the like.

In another implementation the digital audio stream is transmitted wirelessly such as by way of a WiFi or Bluetooth protocol. If the converter device is instead incorporated within its respective access device the digital audio transmitter may be omitted from the converter device .

In the example of each digital audio stream generated by a converter device may be received at a digital audio receiver of the access device . In some implementations such as the use of an Ethernet network to transmit and receive the digital audio streams the digital audio receivers may be embodied as a single Ethernet receiver or transceiver with multiple connectors with each connector receiving a digital audio stream from one of the converter devices . The Ethernet receiver may also act as a transceiver to provide the signals necessary to implement the Ethernet protocol as controlled by the control logic . In other examples a separate digital audio receiver is used for each digital audio stream to be received as depicted in .

The control logic may provide each of the received digital audio streams to the wireless transceiver for transmission as one or more wireless digital audio streams to the mobile communication devices of . In one example the wireless transceiver in conjunction with the control logic operates as a transceiver operating under IEEE 802.11x WiFi protocols. In addition the access device may serve as a wireless router for transfer of additional content between the various mobile communication devices . The access device may in some examples operate as a router for transfer of information associated with the converter devices including configuration information.

The communication network interface is configured to facilitate communications between the access device and the communication node of via the communication network . In one example the communication network interface employs an Ethernet connection for communication with a gateway device such as a cable or digital subscriber line DSL modem in communication with the Internet or other communication network . In another example the communication network interface may incorporate the functionality of such a gateway device.

In some implementations the control logic may provide functionality possibly under the guidance of a system administrator or other personnel to support a number of functions related to the operation of the audio distribution system . These functions may include but are not limited to configuration and operation of the audio distribution functions network management and administration of the mobile communication devices as nodes of a LAN and network routing functions for the LAN. The control logic may also provide web related functions such as a captive portal and redirection functions similar to those associated with a walled garden thus giving the proprietor of the venue or other entity control over web content accessible by the mobile communication devices via the access device . Further in one example the control logic prevents mobile communication devices that are not executing a specific application that may be required to communicate with the access device from discovering a network access password needed to engage in communications with the access device .

The control logic possibly in conjunction with the communication node of may also facilitate one or more of the services described above such as chatting gaming point of sale transactions customer loyalty programs and the like. Examples regarding these various programs are discussed in greater detail below.

The control logic may include electronic hardware software or some combination thereof such as one or more processors configured to execute instructions that cause the processor to perform the various operations described herein that are attributed to the access device .

The wireless transceiver receives the one or more wireless digital audio streams transmitted from an access device as well as transmits and or receives the additional content mentioned above. In one example the wireless transceiver under the operation of the control logic communicates with the access device using WiFi protocols. In some examples the wireless transceiver may also communicate with another communication network such as a cellular telephone network employing CDMA Code Division Multiple Access GSM Global System for Mobil Communications and or other communication protocols.

In one embodiment the wireless transceiver may receive the one or more wireless digital audio streams from a source other than the access device . For example a centralized audio stream server which may not be associated with or located near the venue at which the mobile communication device is positioned may provide at least some digital audio streams by way of the Internet or another communication network to the mobile communication device . Use of a centralized audio stream server may be appropriate in situations in which for example converter devices are not available at the venue or business constraints such as licensing restrictions exist.

The user interface allows a user of the mobile communication device to interact with the mobile communication device . Such interaction may include for example user selection of a wireless digital audio stream received at the mobile communication device user listening of the selected wireless digital audio stream and user involvement with services provided via the access device by way of the additional content communicated between the mobile communication device and the access device . Components that may be incorporated as part of the user interface may include but are not limited to a visual display possibly integrated with a touch display or touchscreen a keypad an audio speaker and or audio connector a Bluetooth interface for an audio speaker or earphone a microphone a camera and an accelerometer.

The mobile communication device may also include the geographic location circuitry an example of which may be circuitry for receiving satellite signals from the Global Positioning System GPS that may be employed by the control logic to determine the geographic location of the mobile communication device . As is described more fully below the control logic may employ the location information to determine if a nearby access device is available to the mobile device for communication purposes.

The control logic may control any and or all of the other components of the mobile communications device such as the wireless transceiver the user interface and the geographic location circuitry . The control logic may include electronic hardware software or some combination thereof such as one or more processors configured to execute instructions that cause the processor to perform the various operations described herein that are attributed to the mobile communication device .

In one example the communication connection module facilitates the creation of a communication connection between the mobile communication device and the access device to allow the reception of the one or more wireless digital audio streams as well as the transmission and reception of the additional content . The communication connection module may also assist in creating a secure connection between the mobile communication device and the access device for various services described more fully below. In one example the communication connection module also facilitates creating a communication connection between the mobile communication device and the communication node of and other nodes by way of an alternative communication network such as a cellular telephone network.

The channel selection module in one example presents identities of a set of audio channels to the user via the user interface as carried in the one or more wireless digital audio streams receives a user selection of one of the channels and presents the selected channel to the user such as by way of an audio speaker or other audio output interface. In an example the channel selection module may present the identity of an audio channel associated with an identity of its corresponding audio video output device so that the user may discern which audio channel to select for the video content he is currently viewing.

In one example the geographic location module by utilizing the geographic location circuitry may determine the current location of the mobile communication device to decide which of multiple access devices currently available are providing acceptable communication signals or signal strengths to the mobile communication device and thus are the access devices most likely to provide audio content of interest to the user of the mobile communication device .

In another example the current location of the mobile communication device may be used to recommend other locations or venues that possess at least one access device for the provision of the services described herein especially in cases in which no access devices are immediately available at the current location. This functionality is described in greater detail below.

In other situations technologies other than the geographical location circuitry may be utilized to determine with greater specificity a location of the mobile communication device . In just one example the geographic location module may be configured to decipher quick response QR codes placed at various locations in a venue to determine the location of the mobile communication device within the venue . Such information may then be made available to the communication node to refine or otherwise direct the services provided to the mobile communication device such as the delivery of food to a specific table equipped with the QR code. Other technologies such as radio frequency identification RFID technology may be used to similar effect.

Generally the chat service module the advertising sales service module the gaming service module and the customer loyalty service module may facilitate communication in the form of the additional content between the mobile communication device and the access device and possibly the communication node to provide the user of the mobile communication device access to each of these services. Other examples of the mobile communication device in conjunction with the access device may provide to the user other services of interest that are not explicitly described herein.

The chat service module discussed more fully below may facilitate communications between the user of the mobile communication device and the users of other connected mobile communication devices via chat rooms. In some examples such communications may be carried on between mobile communication devices communicatively coupled to the same access device or to different access devices whether located at the same venue or different venues.

The advertising sales service module may receive advertising from the access device and present the received advertising to the user of the mobile communication device . In some examples the advertising may be sourced by the venue an advertiser associated with the audio channel selected by the user for reception or another entity such as a regional or national product or service provider. The advertising sales service module may also facilitate point of sale transactions and related processing and information transfer between the access device and the mobile communication device . For example the user may order food items merchandise or the like offered by the venue and pay for the ordered items by way of a credit card or other account. Prior to such communications the advertising sales module may invoke the communication connection module to create a secure connection between the access device and the mobile communication device to protect the transmitted information associated with the transaction.

Similarly the gaming service module may facilitate the transfer of information relating to gaming and or wagering between the mobile communication device and the access device . For example if the venue is a gambling casino the mobile communication device may present offers regarding available wagers to be made on a particular outcome of an upcoming sporting event. In response the user of the mobile communication device may place a wager on a particular outcome of the event via the device and transmit the wager via a secure connection with the access device . The results of the wager may then be presented to the user via the mobile communication device . In other examples instead of a wager the user may provide an answer to a trivia question posed by the venue such as a sports bar.

To facilitate a customer loyalty program associated with the venue or another entity the customer loyalty service module may receive information regarding available registration for a loyalty program such as a program associated with the venue at which the user is located for example the current number of points or other indication regarding the standing of the user within the loyalty program information as to how the user may earn more points information as to what the user may receive for redeeming a quantity of the earned points and other related information and present that information to the user. The user in response may register for the loyalty program earn more points redeem previously earned points or perform some other action regarding the customer loyalty program by providing response information via the mobile communication device to the access device .

The user settings module may allow a user to alter or change various settings or parameters that control the operation of the mobile communication device or the access device . Examples of such settings include but are not limited to details regarding how the mobile communication device presents information to the user information associated with the user such as a chat handle or identifier for the user selection of a LAN for communication with an access device user visibility anonymity settings and user preferences regarding reception of personalized offers or loyalty program subscriptions.

The social network access module may allow a user to access social functions within the system such as invitations friend identification and location business social marketing features and interconnection with the features of other social networks such as Facebook . In one example a user may broadcast the location and current status of the user to friends or the entire system upon the user initiating an application allowing access to the audio distribution system or upon initiating a connection with an access device . In another implementation the user may initiate the broadcast operation via a selection button or other data entry mechanism provided by an application executing on the mobile communication device . In some examples these and other social network functions are provided within the system via API Application Programming Interface support from other social networks such as Facebook .

In one example upon the user selecting one of the available audio channels a second display associated with the selected audio channel may be presented to the user. This display may present information such as the broadcast channel and the particular program or event involved which is specifically associated with the selected audio channel. In some examples the channel specific display may include advertising such as advertising corresponding to the broadcast channel or the venue.

The communication node of in one example may facilitate access by the mobile communication devices to the various services described above as well as to provide configuration and membership functionality related to the audio distribution systems discussed above. In some implementations the communication node may be referred to as a server providing these various functions. Thus the communication node may include at least one computer processor executing instructions associated with a number of software modules to perform the various functions discussed below. In some examples a module may include software electronic hardware or some combination thereof.

The access device configuration module may cause the communication node to communicate with an access device by way of the communication network to configure the access device including for example network and communication parameters to be used by the access device and information to be stored on the access device for transfer to one or more mobile communication devices . In one example the access device configuration module may also provide configuration information for one or more converter devices in communication with the access device via the access device . In some implementations the access device configuration module may also control configurations of one or more of the mobile communication devices by way of information transmitted via the access device .

The venue subscription module may perform operations associated with initiating and maintaining a subscription to one or more services available via the communication node by an entity associated with the venue hosting the access device . In one example such an entity may subscribe over some period of time such as a year or a month to provide any or all of a number of services including but not limited to an audio distribution service a chat service a gaming service a customer loyalty service and a point of sale service. Such a subscription in one example may allow the entity to provide one or more of the services to patrons or customers of the entity free of charge. The entity may also subscribe to an advertising service as is described in greater detail below.

The user administration module may facilitate the registration of users of mobile communication devices with the system . Such registration may for example allow the communication node to store identification data such as a chat handle credit card information personal preferences friend identifications of other users and other data associated with the user. The maintenance of such information at the communication node may allow the communication node to recognize the user quickly and allow the user to employ the information regardless of the particular access device or venue currently hosting the user. In some cases the user administration module may also control access to the system on a user by user basis depending on previous activities of the user the current number of users coupled to the system and or other factors.

The user analytics module may allow the communication node to track each connection or session to the system by a user of a particular mobile communication device via an access device including but not limited to the types of services utilized by the user and the particular audio content requested by the user. Such information may be beneficial for directing particular types of advertising to the user offering specific services to the user and the like. In some examples the communication node may also employ the information to determine how the user employs the access device and other portions of the system . In one example by aggregating this information for each of the users the communication node may determine proper configurations for access devices to make the system more efficient determine future equipment needs for the system and so on. Thus the metrics and related information provided via the user analytics module may be advantageous for both administrators of the system and paid subscribers to the system .

The user session profile module may maintain a database of session profiles for each user such as end users entities associated with particular venues system administrators and the like so that the communication node may control user access to the system . Each of the session profiles may include for example a domain name user name or log in password and the like. A profile may also allow a user to access the system by way of an access device over the Internet through a cellular phone network or via some other communication path. In some examples a session profile may also include information specific to the mobile communication device employed by the user such as the type and model of the device the functional and performance capabilities of the device and the like.

The advertising subscription module may facilitate the initiation and maintenance of advertising subscriptions by various entities such as those associated with specific venues . In one example an advertising subscription may allow an entity associated with a venue to provide advertising to one or more mobile communication devices coupled with an access device located at the venue as discussed above. Other entities such as national or regional providers of goods or services that are not associated with a particular venue may also subscribe to the advertising services provided by the system .

The advertising content module may provide means by which advertising subscribers may upload advertising content to the communication node for subsequent transmission to mobile communication devices by way of the system . In some examples subscriber entities associated with a particular venue may have their advertising delivered to mobile communication devices communicatively coupled with an access device located at the venue . Advertising supplied by national or regional subscribers may be transmitted to mobile communication devices located at multiple venues .

In some implementations the advertising supplied to a mobile communication device may initiate other actions within the mobile communication device . For example in response to a user touching or otherwise activating a displayed advertisement the mobile communication device may open a web browser and direct the browser to an associated web page such as a web page for the subscriber providing the advertisement. In another example the mobile communication device may initiate some activity such as a game a registration process in a loyalty program a purchase or a wager.

The advertising audience report module may generate and provide to advertising subscribers reports regarding users of the mobile communication devices that receive or are capable of receiving the advertising provided by the advertising subscriber. Such information may include for example demographic information personal interest information survey response information point of sale transaction information a number of advertisement impressions a number of advertisements with user interaction and the like that the advertising subscriber may find useful in directing current and future advertising efforts.

The social network service module the customer loyalty service module and the gaming service module facilitate the provision of the corresponding services discussed above with respect to the social network access module the gaming service module and the customer loyalty service module of the mobile communication device respectively. Each of these services is described in greater detail above. Each of these modules may facilitate the services for each user at each venue associated with the system . Further each service may be organized by venue across the entire system by corporate entity by specific product brand and or by any other type of organizational structure applicable to social networks gaming services and customer loyalty programs.

One or more other service specific modules may also be incorporated in the communication node to facilitate one or more services such as for example point of sale or mobile commerce mCommerce transactions. In one implementation the communication node provides the service related information offer of products for example to a user of a mobile communication device by way of the communication network and the access device that is communicatively coupled with the mobile communication device . The communication node may also receive any responses to the service related information for example product purchases from the user via the same path and process those responses in order to provide the desired services. In other examples point of sale transaction and other services may be provided to subscribers other than those entities associated with a particular venue .

While much of the above discussion focuses on certain public venues such as restaurants bars and sports books as likely locations for implementation of the systems and methods described herein other venues both public and private such as airport terminals or gate areas corporate reception lobbies doctor s office waiting areas and so on may also benefit from application of the various concepts described herein.

Certain embodiments such as the converter devices the access devices the mobile communication devices and the communication nodes discussed above are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple such hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. APIs .

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware or software or in combinations thereof. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product e.g. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers .

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communications network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on their respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that both hardware and software architectures may be considered. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set forth hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of data structures and instructions e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures. The term non transitory machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present subject matter or that is capable of storing encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term non transitory machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of non transitory machine readable media include but are not limited to non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a computer network using a transmission medium. The instructions may be transmitted using the network interface device and any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. HTTP . Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN the Internet mobile telephone networks Plain Old Telephone Service POTS networks and wireless data networks e.g. WiFi and WiMAX networks . The term transmission medium shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.
