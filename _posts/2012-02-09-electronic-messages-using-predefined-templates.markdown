In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a full understanding of the present disclosure. It will be apparent however to one ordinarily skilled in the art that the embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances well known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the disclosure.

According to the various aspects of the subject technology systems and methods for sending electronic messages using predefined templates are provided. A user of an electronic message such as for example email may wish to quickly send out a message in response to a received message or may wish to quickly send out multiple messages to multiple recipients. For example the user may wish to send out a quick reply on the go or confirm receipt of numerous applications for a graduate school program. Standard language emails may be used for such instances. Such emails typically contain identical generic contents which apply to all recipients and usually address the recipients with generic greetings such as for example To whom it may concern or Dear Sir Madam. The standard language emails provide an efficient means of acknowledging receipt of emails or sending out emails to multiple recipients. However there may be a need to add some personalization to the emails without sacrificing the efficiency of having standard languages. For example users may wish to use a standard language but address the recipient by his or her first name or may wish to add a personalized signature. While the descriptions below will generally refer to emails other types of electronic messages such as for example text messages instant messaging service messages blog posts and social networking service posts may also be used.

The system may provide one or more predefined email templates which a user may select to use as a basis for an email. Each template may be a standard language email message containing personalization symbols which are automatically replaced with default values based on predetermined rules. The personalization symbols may represent a variety of aspects of an email which the user may wish to have personalized. For example a symbol f receiver may represent the first name of the recipient. Thus when a user selects a template including the symbol f receiver the system may replace the symbol with the first name of the recipient.

The actual values represented by the symbols may be obtained in a variety of ways depending on what type of values the symbols represent. In the foregoing example the first name of the recipient may be determined by looking up the user s contact list based on the email address entered in the To field. Other symbols may include for example a symbol representing today s date the recipient s address and the sender s full name. The actual values represented by these types of symbols may be obtained for example from the system calendar date contact list recipient s address or system settings sender s full name .

After the system has replaced the symbols with their corresponding default values according to the predetermined rules the user may review the default values and may either keep the default values or override them. For example after the system replaces the symbol f receiver with the first name of the recipient the user may decide that it would be more appropriate to address the recipient by his or her last name and manually type in the last name in place of the first name.

Another type of symbol may be provided to serve as placeholders to prompt the user to type in a custom message to the recipient. For example in a template for sending a quick response to a graduate school application the symbol may serve as a placeholder and prompt the sender to type in a message which makes specific references to parts of the recipient s application. Unique placeholder symbols are associated with different prompt messages to which the symbols may be converted upon application of the template. The personalization symbols may be predefined in the system or the symbols and their associated prompt messages may be received from the user. For example the system may include a predetermined symbol prompt personalized signature which is associated with the prompt message PLEASE TYPE IN YOUR PERSONALIZED SIGNATURE HERE. As another example the system may receive from the user a placeholder symbol prompt personalized greetings . This placeholder symbol is not predefined in the system and the user also provides the system with the prompt message PLEASE TYPE IN YOUR PERSONALIZED GREETING HERE to which the placeholder symbol will be converted to upon application of the template. In the following descriptions the symbols which are replaced with default values based on predetermined rules are referred to as personalization symbols and the symbols serving as placeholders to prompt the user to type in a message are referred to as placeholder symbols. 

A list of the symbols contained in the current template may be separately shown to the user. Using the list the user may conveniently identify review and determine whether to override the symbols.

The system provides a user interface UI for accessing the templates. The user is presented with a drop down menu listing the templates available to the user. The user may access the drop down menu and select an appropriate menu item to access the desired template. Instead of a drop down menu other types of UI for accessing the symbols may also be provided.

The system also provides the user with a template generation UI for generating an email template. The personalization and placeholder symbols are represented as buttons on a template generation UI. The template generation UI includes two types of symbol buttons i personalization symbol buttons and ii placeholder symbol buttons. i The personalization symbol buttons are provided for inserting symbols such as a symbol representing the first name of the recipient. Buttons for inserting personalization symbols representing other types of information such as for example last name and current date may also be included in the UI. The user may click on the buttons to insert the corresponding symbol. For example if the user clicks on the button representing the first name then the symbol f receiver is inserted in the email template. The system will automatically replace these personalization symbols with their default values based on predetermined rules if the user selects and uses the template. ii The placeholder symbol buttons these buttons are provided for inserting placeholder symbols in the email template. If the user clicks this button the system will prompt the user to enter the name of a predefined placeholder symbol. After the user enters in the name of the predefined placeholder symbol the symbol is placed in the email template. For example the personalization symbol prompt personalized signature may be predefined to be associated with the prompt message PLEASE TYPE IN YOUR PERSONALIZED SIGNATURE HERE. Therefore if the user enters prompt personalized signature the symbol is placed in the email template and this symbol the system will replace this symbol with the prompt message PLEASE TYPE IN YOUR PERSONALIZED SIGNATURE HERE if the email template is applied. The prompt message may also be highlighted. The user may also provide a user defined placeholder symbol and its associated message prompt.

Turning to the drawings illustrates an example system for sending email using predefined templates. The system includes servers and clients connected over a network . Each of the clients may interact with users and communicate with the servers to compose and send emails using templates. The servers may be any device having an appropriate processor memory and communications capability for communicating with the clients and sending emails. The clients may be for example desktop computers laptop computers mobile devices e.g. a smart phone tablet computer or PDA set top boxes e.g. for a television televisions video game consoles home appliances e.g. a refrigerator microwave oven washer or dryer or any other devices having appropriate processor memory and communications capabilities. The network may include for example any one or more of a personal area network PAN a local area network LAN a campus area network CAN a metropolitan area network MAN a wide area network WAN a broadband network BBN the Internet and the like. Further the network can include but is not limited to any one or more of the following network topologies including a bus network a star network a ring network a mesh network a star bus network tree or hierarchical network and the like. The system may comprise only servers or may comprise only clients in communication with the network .

The server includes a processor the communications module and a memory that includes one or more email templates one or more emails an email template generation module and an email generation module . The memory may also include a contact list and one or more personalized email bodies . The email template generation module stores instructions for displaying the email template generation UI and generating an email template based on user input. The email generation module stores instructions for generating an email based on an email template and user input. The contact list stores the contact information of the user s contact entities. The contact information stores information such as for example the contact entities email addresses names and home work addresses. The personalized email body is generated based on the email template by replacing the symbols of the email template with their default values or prompt messages depending on the type of the symbols. The email is generated based on the personalized email body and user inputs.

The client includes a processor the communications module and a memory that includes a client application . The client application may provide the user an interface to provide input for generating the email using the templates . The client application may be for example an email client a web browser or an application of a mobile device. The client also includes an input device such as a keyboard touch screen or mouse to receive user inputs. The client further includes an output device such as a monitor printer or projector. Instructions for causing the processors and to generate and send an email using predefined templates are also stored in the memory and memory . The instructions may be spread across the memories and or may be stored entirely in either memory or . The instructions may be physically coded to the processors and . The instructions may be spread across the processors and or may be entirely encoded in either processor or .

While illustrates both the server and the client communicating with each other over the network the system may comprise only the server incorporating all the features of the client . The system also may include only the client incorporating all the features of the server .

The personalization symbol represents a default value determined based on a predetermined rule. The predetermined rule may be for example identifying the name of the symbol and fetching a value based on the identified name. More specifically the rule may instruct the system that if the name of the personalization symbol is f receiver identify the email address of the recipient from the To field determine the first name of the recipient based on the contact list and replace the personalization symbol with the first name of the recipient. As another example if the personalization symbol is f todays date identify today s date from a system calendar and replace the symbol with today s date. Other types of personalization symbols and predetermined rules may also be available. If the user selects the email template the system converts the personalization symbol to a default value according to the predetermined rule.

The example email also includes a placeholder symbol . The placeholder symbol is associated with a prompt message. If the user selects the email template the system converts the placeholder symbol with the associated prompt message. The placeholder symbol and its associated prompt message may be predefined in the system. The placeholder symbol and its associated message may also be received from the user. The prompt message associated with the placeholder symbol replaces the placeholder symbol when the user applies the email template and prompts the user to type in a desired message in place of the prompt. For example the placeholder symbol is replaced with bold faced text placed among the text of the email body such that the prompt message may be easily identified by the user. The user may recognize the prompt message and type in a custom message in the place of the prompt message.

When the user selects the email template and applies the template to an email the system replaces any personalization symbol and placeholder symbol of the template with appropriate values or messages as described above and generates a personalized email body e.g. personalized email body . In the example personalized email body the personalization symbol is replaced with its default value . As discussed above the system replaces the personalization symbol based on a predetermined rule for the symbol. The personalization symbol illustrated in is for a first name of the recipient and its associated predetermined rule causes the system to look up the first name of the user in a contact list e.g. contact list based on an email address in the To field. Therefore in the example personalized email body the system replaced the symbol with the first name of the recipient as a default value .

The example email template also includes a placeholder symbol . illustrates a placeholder symbol which has an associated prompt message which reads PLEASE TYPE IN YOUR PERSONALIZED SIGNATURE HERE. Therefore in the example personalized email body the system replaced the placeholder symbol with the prompt message in the text of the email body .

The user may view the example personalized email body and recognize the prompt message . Based on the text of the prompt message the user may replace the prompt message with a desired custom message. The prompt message is made prominent to the user so that the user may easily identify the prompt message. For example the text of the prompt message may be in all capital letters bold faced highlighted or encased in a box. Other means for making the prompt message may also be used such as for example flashing the message prompt displaying a pop up window pointing to the prompt message having a font different from the rest of the email body or preceding and following the prompt message with a special character such as .

The default value is also made prominent to the user so that the user may easily identify them. The default value may be made prominent in the same manner as the prompt message . The default value may also be made prominent in a manner different from the prompt message so that the user may easily distinguish between the two. The user may identify the default value and may choose to override the default value with a desired value or message. For example in the example personalized email body the system replaced the personalization symbol with the default value which reads Joe. However the user may wish to replace the default value with a value which reads Mr. Smith. 

The system may provide a symbol list UI not shown which displays a list of the default values and prompt messages of the example personalized email body . Using the symbol list UI the user may conveniently identify the prompt messages and replace the prompt messages with custom messages. The user may also use the symbol list UI to identify any default values that the user may wish to override.

In step the processor executes instructions to determine if any input from the user for overriding the default values is received. If such input is received in step the default value is replaced in the personalized email body based on the override input. If no such input is received or after step in step custom messages e.g. custom messages for replacing the prompt messages are received. In step the prompt messages are replaced with the received custom messages in the personalized email body. In step the processor executes instructions to determine whether all the prompt messages have been replaced. If so in step an email e.g. email is generated which includes the personalized email body and is sent to the recipient. If not all prompt messages are replaced then the process is repeated from step .

In an aspect of the invention the UI may also include a UI element not shown which allows the user to define a custom personalization symbol and its associated rule for replacing with a default value. For example if the user does not see a button corresponding to a desired type of personalization symbol the user may access a separate button for defining a custom personalization symbol to define the desired symbol and its associated rules. A separate application programming interface API may be provided for defining the symbols and rules.
