In embodiments the mobile communication facility may use a locator facility e.g. GPS system to locate itself in its present location or locations of interest to the user whether explicitly stated or determined by PIM data location history or previous searches. In embodiments the location may be transmitted back to the locator facility for dissemination processing etc. Geographic information systems may also be used to determine a location point in a polygon a location radius search route calculation points of interest and or geocoding and reverse geocoding. In embodiments a user s location may also be self entered into the wireless platform by the user. For example the user may type in or speak through a voice recognition system an address zip code or other location information.

In an embodiment a GPS system may be used as the locator facility. The GPS system consists of a group of satellites 20 carrying atomic clocks that orbit the Earth twice a day. Earth based observatories record orbital data related to the motion of the satellites. In order to determine global positioning a GPS receiver e.g. one disposed inside of the mobile communication facility must communicate with four of the GPS satellites. The receiver computes its distance from each of the four satellites to determine its latitude longitude elevation and time of day. The receiver computes the distance to each of the four satellites by calculating the difference between local time and the time the satellite signals were sent and then decodes the satellites locations from their radio signals and an internal database. The location of the GPS receiver is located at the intersection of the four spheres created by the four satellites where each radius is equal to the time delay between the satellite and the receiver multiplied by the speed of the radio signals. The differences permit calculation of three hyperboloids of revolution of two sheets the intersection point of which gives the precise location of the receiver. If the elevation of the receiver is known it is possible to compute precise location using only three satellites.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a data facility containing mobile subscriber characteristics pertaining to individual users of a mobile communication facility . This data may include but is not limited to data collected by the wireless provider when an individual opens a wireless account such as age sex race religion area code home address work address billing address credit card information passwords family information e.g. mother s maiden name birthplace driver s license number employer position annual income income bracket items purchased friends and family information including any of the foregoing types of information and the like. The mobile subscriber characteristics facility may continually or periodically update data for individual users for example bill amount s average bill total payment history on time payment history on line usage amount duration of on line interactions number of on line interactions family status and family information number of children shopping habits e.g. views of or purchases of goods and services click stream information device type and device version device characteristics usage patterns including those based on location time of day or other variables device and or subscriber unique identifiers content viewing history content presented for viewed by not viewed by user content and programs downloaded videos music and audio listened to and or downloaded television watched timing and duration of viewing downloading transaction history and any other user or user defined characteristics. The purchase of physical goods may be facilitated by a wireless provider by having the wireless provider collect the user s credit card information as part of the billing cycle and adding goods transactions automatically to the wireless provider s bill to the user.

The mobile subscriber characteristics database may also track data related to phone usage and location. For example data collected could include a history of phone calls made phone calls received the mobile subscriber characteristics of the persons calling or called by the user the duration of calls a history of communications made via phone Internet email instant messaging or chat and the entities communicated with by these technologies history of phone calls made linked with geographic location information at the time of each call log of phone numbers and a history of clicks and clickthroughs or other keystroke or user interface equivalents thereof including voice initiated actions made using the mobile communication facility .

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain mobile search host facilities . Within the mobile search host facility there may be other facilities including but not limited to a disambiguation facility search facility algorithm facility results facility parental control facility privacy facility transactional security facility carrier business rules facility voice recognition facility sponsorship facility and or an implicit query facility . The mobile search host facility may also link to another data facility .

The disambiguation facility may complete or provide more meaning to ambiguous active user inputs. The disambiguation facility may include SMS lingo translation single word initial substring completion multiple word substring completion stem completion e.g. single into plural format verb into gerund thesaurus lookups for homonyms or synonyms spell check algorithms spell check tables phonetic spelling algorithms phonetic spelling tables phone number keypad to word conversion including completion of possible substrings from number sequence frequency based algorithms semantic analysis algorithms location based algorithms or other algorithms or facilities for reducing ambiguity as to the meaning of a query or partial query entered by a user.

The search facility may initiate a search such as by causing a query optionally a disambiguated query to be executed on a search facility such as a search engine. The search engine might be a search facility that is based on Boolean search logic categories of results term frequencies document frequencies documents selected by other users who have entered similar queries link structures of possible results or any other known search facilities using any other known search algorithm.

A mobile search service e.g. as disclosed herein may be accessed by a user through a user interface of a mobile communication facility such as a mobile phone a cellular phone satellite phone a GSM phone or other phone type. The mobile communication facility may need to be activated to access the mobile search service. A mobile communication facility may be activated by a user taking an action. The action may be different for different phone embodiments of a mobile communication facility . For example a flip or folding phone may be activated by unfolding or flipping open the phone. In another example a straight phone may be activated by depressing a key on the phone keypad for a predetermined length of time. A sliding top or twist top phone may be activated by sliding or twisting open respectively the top to reveal a user interface of the phone. Other phone methods of activating a phone based on the phone embodiment are also possible. A phone may be activated by turning on the phone. Turing on the phone may include attaching a battery to the phone plugging the phone into a power source such as a desktop charger or an automobile charger switching the phone power switch depressing a key on a phone user interface for a minimum time and the like. A phone may be activated by unlocking the phone which may include a user entering an activation code into the phone through the phone user interface or by speaking the activation code into the phone microphone.

Activating a phone may enable a user to have access to one or more features and functions of the phone such as making a call answering a call navigating menus of the user interface using a mobile search service and the like. Some features and functions may require a user to first activate the feature or function through the user interface such as reviewing call history. Other features may be activated immediately when the phone is activated. As an example a user can often immediately enter a telephone number to initiate a call without first activating a call feature of the phone.

In embodiments a mobile search service e.g. as disclosed herein may be activated immediately when a phone is activated. A mobile search service accessed through a search box of a mobile communication facility user interface may be activated at the time a phone is activated such that a user can immediately enter a search item in the search box . As an example immediately after a user flips open a flip phone a mobile search service search box may be presented and activated such that a query entry through the user interface may be entered in the search box . To further this example a user may flip open their flip phone and immediately enter the name of their local sports team through the phone user interface. The mobile search service may provide search results through the phone user interface. In addition to the search box receiving input from the user interface immediately after the phone is activated the mobile search service search box may also receive voice entry .

The mobile search service search box and entries it is receiving may be presented on the display of the phone which may also include an indicator controlled through the user interface of the current state of the keypad and voice entry mode of the phone. In embodiments the indicator may indicate when the phone is enabled to place and receive phone calls and when it is enabled to access the mobile search service. The indicator may be an aspect of the search box or a separate indication on the display of the phone. As an example the search box may display reduced contrast entries in the box such as graying out the entry when the phone state enables placing and receiving calls. In another example the search box may include a blinking cursor at the point of entry when the phone is enabled to access the mobile search service. A phone call search service state indicator may be beneficial when a mobile communication facility has been activated such that the user interface display is active but the phone has not yet completed an initialization operation such as connecting to a wireless network. In an example a mobile search service search box may be presented immediately upon activating the phone but may be activated in close temporal proximity such as within 5 seconds of activating the phone.

Upon activation the mobile search service search box may be predetermined either as a network search box a wireless carrier s walled garden content search box or other mobile content search box. Alternatively a user may select through a feature of the user interface whether the search box type upon activation. Alternatively the user selection may be temporary wherein the mobile search service search box returns to the predetermined selection the next time the phone is activated. The mobile search service search box may be related to a search vertical which may be a general search or may be related to a vertical search of one or more of the following ring tones images games a yellow pages weather a white pages news headlines WAP sites web sites movie show times sports scores stock quotes flight times maps directions a price comparison WIFI hotspots package tracking hotel rates fantasy sports stats horoscopes answers a dictionary area codes zip codes entertainment blogs and other mobile content associated with a search vertical.

A mobile communication facility may rely on a network for connection to external resources. A network may at times experience poor communication or complete lack of communication. Such an event may compromise a substantial benefit of searching for mobile content with the mobile communication facility . However by managing the resources of the mobile communication facility such that it retains critical relevant current timely popular or otherwise characterized information such as mobile content the mobile communication facility may retain at least a portion of the benefit even when the network connecting to the mobile communication facility is out. Furthermore by differentiating between content located on and off the mobile communication facility and providing search boxes for both content may be more efficiently delivered for presentation to the user.

When connected to a network a mobile communication facility may use the resources of the mobile search host facilities such as the search facility to execute mobile content queries. Alternatively or cooperatively to the search facility the mobile communication facility may utilize an internet search facility such as a search engine. A wireless provider may also provide query search capabilities such that information available to the wireless provider such as mobile subscriber characteristics advertiser data walled garden content and the like may be searched based on a query entered by a user on an mobile communication facility .

When disconnected from a network these resources mobile content data characteristics and the like may not be available to a mobile communication facility to complete a search query. Therefore a mobile communication facility may include search capability and functionality to search local resources to complete a search query. The local search query functionality may supplement a network or remote search or may operate independently of the network even if the network is connected and fully operational.

Local search query functionality may also be useful for finding information that a network resource may not access. Information stored locally on the mobile communication facility such as cached content data files configuration data programs deleted item private items and the like may be searchable from a local search query facility.

Local searching may be useful to find mobile content if the mobile content or a reference to it can be found locally. Therefore providing a searchable store of mobile content may be beneficial to the effectiveness of local mobile content searching. Local storage may include any an all storage capability and facilities herein disclosed for the mobile communication facility including removable storage devices that may connect to one or more external ports of the and data facility .

Information stored locally that may facilitate a local search may originate from the user or an external source. The external source may be a network as herein described. The information from the network may include mobile content that has been provided to the mobile communication facility as a response to a search query as sponsored content associated with a web page as an RSS feed or other reasons. The information stored locally may be the content provided to the mobile communication facility or it may be header data metadata or search query results such a list of websites.

Maintaining the information in the local storage resources to facilitate useful and relevant responses to a search query may be performed by a cache facility as herein described. Such a cache facility may provide storage and maintenance of information retrieved from the network such as mobile content such that the cached information is updated from time to time to maintain its relevance and value. When the mobile communication facility is not connected to a network the local search facility may present local results to the user. However it may record the query as entered so that when the mobile communication facility is on line again the query can be provided to the network resources such that the information stored locally can be updated. This may facilitate maintaining the local information such that it has a relevance because it satisfies a recent user search query to the user.

A local search facility may also provide a more timely response to a search query than a network resource since there is no need for network communication to provide a reply to the search query. This may allow a user to review and interact with search query results while a network search is proceeding. Given that search results may change quickly at least in part due to the dynamic nature of mobile content search results from local storage may be identified as such to the user. The local results may also be identified in other ways to facilitate a user s understanding of the results. For example a local result that was last updated more than a minimum amount of time such as 2 days may be identified by highlighting the item on the mobile communication facility display with a contrasting color such as yellow. If the results are older than a maximum time such as a week they may be highlighted with red. In this way the user can review the query results identify the local results and identify the age of the local results. The user interface of the mobile communication facility may offer an update results selection for local results when the facility is connected to a network.

When connected to a network and a user selects a local result the mobile communication facility may automatically use a corresponding link downloaded from the search results of the network resources. This may facilitate a user accessing the latest mobile content associated with a local search result. As an example a user may search for nearby movie theaters to see what is playing tonight. The local search result may present a name of a movie theatre and a link to access the theatre movie listing. The link may direct the user to the current movie listing on the website instead of an older listing associated with the link stored in cache on the mobile communication facility .

The foregoing describes some options for integrating local information with network search results using a local search facility. An alternative to the foregoing may include the network search facility performing the search on the network resources as well as the locally stored information and mobile content on the mobile communication facility . By the network search facilities searching all available content including the content on the mobile communication facility the search results presented to the user will integrate local and network in a unified updated presentation.

Mobile search results as herein described may include one or more lists to content that are associated with the search query. A user may interact with the search results such as selecting a result and receiving further information through a user interface of the mobile communication facility . An aspect of the present invention may facilitate a user with other actions associated with a search result such as making a purchase previewing content saving a result and the like. Methods and systems for facilitating these and other actions that may be associated with a search result are described below.

Action commands presented to a user of a mobile communication facility may be associated with a search result based on an aspect of the search result. The action commands may be presented to the user through the user interface of the mobile communication facility and the user may access the action command through a feature of the user interface. An action command may present additional search results or action commands to the mobile communication facility .

A mobile search platform may respond to a search query from a mobile communication facility by using a search facility as herein described. The search results generated by the search facility may include aspects such as keywords HTML links metadata and the like that may be used in associating an action command with the search result. The search facility may examine one or more of these aspects to determine what action command would provide the user with the best result of interacting with the search result. By example the search facility may associate a bid action command with a search result that includes a link to bid on an item in an on line auction. In another example a search result that contains keywords that provide an address may have a map action command associated with it.

Since search results may closely match a search query aspects of the search query may also affect the action command associated with a search result. A search query may be broad such that a search facility may return general results with general action commands. For example a search of guitars may return a wide variety of results including types of guitars concert information guitar songs guitar technology on line guitar auctions musical instrument stores and the like. A result to such a broad search query may have an associated action command that provides more detail about the result thereby facilitating a user finding relevant results. Alternatively a search query may be specific or the search facility may provide specific relevant results to a search query. The search facility may associate aspects of the search query with other information such as mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules or user search history and preferences to identify relevant results that may have a specific associated action command. A result of such a specific query may have a specific associated action command. In an example a result associated with a specific guitar offered for sale from a local music store may have an associated purchase action command.

Another aspect of the search result that an action command may be based on is the source of the search result. This may include the website from which the search results was generated the wireless service provider that generated the search result a provider of search services the mobile communication facility and the like. Each of the plurality of sources of the search result may associate an action command with a search result based on preferences business arrangements or other criteria that may at least be partially different for each source. The action command presented may result in the same end action by the user such as ordering the guitar in the example above . However the action command may direct an aspect associated with the action differently for each source. Continuing the example above of a purchase action command being presented to the mobile communication facility a result provided by a website may include an action command to purchase the guitar directly from the manufacturer of the guitar. A result provided by a provider of search services may include an action command to purchase the guitar from an affiliate or distributor of the guitar manufacturer.

A website may include action commands to be associated with search results that match aspects of the website content. The action commands may be included in the website content metadata header information HTML links and the like. The mobile search platform may identify one of the action commands included with a website to be associated with a search result based on aspects of the search query. Websites may include HTML links that result in actions such as purchases registration login contact service repair and the like. The search facility of the mobile search platform may associate an action command related to an HTML link on a website with a search result. In an example a search query for on site guitar repair may generate a search result for a guitar repair provider website that may include a link to scheduling an on site repair. An action command to facilitate scheduling an on site repair may be associated with the search result.

Alternatively a website may include action commands for use with a mobile communication facility . The search facility may include a search result with an associated action command taken from website with a mobile action commands.

The action command may be presented to the user through any aspect of the user interface of the mobile communication facility herein described such as a visual display an audio output a vibration an external port and the like. Similarly the user may interact with the action command through any aspect of the user interface of the mobile communication facility herein described such as a keypad a touch screen microphone external port and the like.

An action command may be associated with each search result presented such that as each search result is selected such as through highlighting or scrolling a displayed result the action command associated with the selected search result is available to the user. The user may interact with the user interface of the mobile communication facility in a variety of ways as herein described. In this way the action command may be accessed by the user through a plurality of inputs such as sequential inputs. In an example the user may provide a first input such as selecting a search result. This first input may make an action command associated with the selected search result available to the user such that a second user input may access the action command. The second user input may be pressing a send button on the user interface of the mobile communication facility and the action may make a call. A variety of first and second user inputs as may be envisioned by one of average skill in the art are herein incorporated.

The action command may be associated with a search result through a sponsorship facility . The sponsorship facility may associate a search result with an action command based on sponsors bidding to have an action command associated with a search result. Sponsors may bid to have an action command associated with a search result based on one or more aspects of the search such as an aspect of the search query an aspect of the search result an aspect of the mobile communication facility an aspect of the user of the mobile communication facility and the like. The sponsorship facility may select a sponsored action command from high bidder based on a relevance of the aspects specified by the sponsor with the search result. In an example a plurality of sponsors may bid to have an action command to purchase tickets to an event associated with a search result associated with the event. When a search query generates a search result associated with the event the action command from the highest bidding sponsor may be associated with the search result and presented to the mobile communication facility .

Alternatively one sponsor may be offering tickets to the event while another may be offering items associated with the event. The mobile search platform may select an action command from a sponsor based on a relevance to the search result over a bid amount. If the search query was directed at items associated with the event the mobile search platform may associate the action command from the item sponsor instead of the ticket sponsor with the search result.

An action command may include presenting additional information to the mobile communication facility . In the example above the action command associated with the search result generated from a search query for the event may be to present a plurality of action commands to the user. At least one of the plurality of action commands may be a sponsored action command as herein described. The plurality of action commands may be presented to the mobile communication facility such that the sponsored action command from the highest bidding sponsor is presented first. In a list of action commands the sponsored action command from the highest bidding sponsor may be at the top of the list. In a sequential presentation of action commands the sponsored action command from the highest bidding sponsor may be the first action command presented. Other orderings of presenting the sponsored action commands are possible such as based on relevance to the search result based on location and many other aspects associated with the mobile search platform . All such orderings are herein included.

Associating an action command to a search result may be performed through an action command provider that is separately associated with the mobile search platform . The mobile search platform may provide a search result to an action command provider and receive back an action command for association with the search result. The mobile search platform may provide additional information such as user demographics mobile communication facility type mobile communication facility location and other information as may be beneficial in receiving a relevant action command.

Action commands may include making a purchase previewing content finding content related to the search result placing a phone call associated with the search result mapping a location forwarding the search result and saving the search result. The forwarded search result may be sent to an email address. Examples of some of these action commands are now presented.

An action command associated with a search result may facilitate a user previewing content associated with the search result. In an example a search result may be associated with a photo sharing webpage. An action command associated with the search result may be to display a thumbnail or a plurality of thumbnails of photos thereby providing a preview of the content available on the webpage. In another example a search result may be associated with an investment research website. The action command associated with the search result may be to download a demonstration of the website thereby allowing a user to preview the content of the website in an annotated demonstration. In another example a search result may be associated with an independent film producer. An action command associated with the search result may be to present a portion of one or more of the film producer s films to the mobile communication facility . In this way the user can preview the content films of the website. Similarly audio a book a new clothing line and the like may be previewed through an action command.

An action command associated with a search result may facilitate a user forwarding the search result. The search result may be forwarded through email test message instant message voice mail video mail message broadcast and any other for of communicating with the mobile communication facility as herein described. In an example an action command associated with any search result may be to forward the search result to another mobile communication facility by email. By accessing the action command through the user interface of the mobile communication facility the user may be prompted to input or select the destination name from a list of email names.

An action command associated with a search result may facilitate bidding on an item associated with the search result. In an example a user may search for a used bicycle on an on line auction website. The result may include one or more auction listing for a used bicycle. The action command associated with this search result may facilitate a user entering a bid for the item. The command may allow a user to enter a bid amount and password and the mobile communication facility may provide any additional identifying information about the user to the on line auction site to accept the bid

An action command associated with a search result may facilitate rating the search result. In an example the action command may accept numeric input from the mobile communication facility such as a cell phone number keypad to rate the search result relevance to the search query. User rating of search results may facilitate providing search results that have greater relevance to the user. The action command may also delete a search result from the search results if the user rates it below a predetermined value such as below 3 out of 10.

An action command associated with a search result may facilitate storing the search result. In an example the action command may facilitate a user saving a search result such as in a favorite storage or a follow up list or other storage that may be associated with the mobile communication facility or the mobile search facility .

In embodiments the search box may be presented upon activating the phone and the search box may be adapted to relate to a specific search methodology. For example the search box may be adapted to provide localized or personalized e.g. searching in relation to mobile subscriber characteristics and the like as described herein . The search box may also be adapted to target results based on time of day. For example the search user interface may be adapted to produce localized results and the keywords filters algorithms or other search parameters identifying the relevant local results may change as a result of the time of day. So if the user opens his flip phone and is presented with the search box he may perform a search and the results may be localized and they may be tailored to the time of day. At 6 00 pm the search results may pertain at least in part to dinner options while a search run at 8 00 pm may relate to entertainment. In embodiments the default search methodology preferences are settable by the user. The user may be able to set the type of search that he would like to perform as a default when presented with the search facility upon activation of the phone. The user may also be presented with options e.g. menu options through which he can select a new search temporary search methodology.

The algorithm facility may receive a user s input in the form of a problem and evaluate that problem by applying the set of all potential solutions available within the search space. At its most basic the algorithm facility may apply na ve uninformed search algorithms consisting of the most intuitive solution s available within the search space. Alternatively the algorithm facility may also employ informed search algorithms based on heuristics that utilize intelligence about the elements of the search space in order to minimize search time and resource allocation of the algorithm facility . The algorithm may serve to promote or demote content for display to the user based upon the frequency of queries the frequency of clicks or clickthroughs the velocity of queries the site of the search launch storefront visit or mobile website community tagging mobile user scoring or it may be based upon domain restrictions e.g. only espn.com .

An algorithm may be designed to create an index for information specific to the mobile communication facility . For example the algorithm may look only for mobile tags e.g. WML xHTML MP MIME types such as text WAP and or WML or mobile specific headers . An algorithm may also determine the aesthetic compatibility between the content and the capabilities of the display of the mobile communication facility including factors such as page width page weight e.g. the number of images and byte size screen resolution and color capabilities font types and sizes client side rendering capabilities page complexity e.g. features incompatible or specific to a mobile communication facility and the like. This compatibility information may also be blended with other information such as popularity data e.g. WAP gateway editorial scoring and or traffic market data .

The algorithm facility may contain a collaborative filtering protocol category filtering a recommendation system and or other process facilities for analyzing refining or filtering user input and or search results. A collaborative filter may employ a two step process. During the first step other users are identified who have similar rating patterns as those of the active user. Secondly the ratings obtained from these similar users provide the empiric basis for predicting information of relevance to the active user. The collaborative filter can be both an inclusive and an exclusive process gathering relevant information for the active user or removing incongruent information from the predictive information set.

A collaborative filtering protocol generally involves the collection of preference data from a large group of users. This preference data may be analyzed statistically to identify subgroups or characteristics of subgroup members with similar preference profiles. Various weighted average fuzzy logic or other techniques may be used to summarize or model a preference subgroup and a preference function may be created using the model summary. This function may then be used to match new users to an appropriate preference subgroup. In embodiments such information may be collected from many individual mobile subscriber characteristic data sets and data may be collected from many mobile communication facility users. For example a wireless provider may collect preference data from a large group of its customers. In embodiments the data may be collected from non mobile users and may relate to preference information collected from other on line or off line activities.

User preferences may be derived from user behavior or other implicit characteristics or explicitly defined by a mobile communication facility user or some combination of these. If users were to explicitly state their preferences e.g. for types of restaurants books e commerce music news video formats audio etc. the explicit preference information may be stored in the mobile subscriber characteristic data bases associated with their phones. Users may implicitly register a preference through activity such as purchasing a product online visiting a site on line making a phone call from a mobile communication facility making a phone call from another facility viewing content or engaging or not engaging in other activities. For example if the user looks at a product and decides not to purchase the product one can draw an inference that the user is not interested in the product and this inference may be used as part of a collaborative filtering algorithm. In addition inferences may be drawn from the types of establishments the user has been calling recently on the mobile communication facility. If he or she has been calling auto dealerships repeatedly over the past two weeks an inference can be drawn that the user is presently looking for auto goods and or services. Implicit preferences of users may also be collected by recording all pages that are visited by users and the frequency and or duration of each visit. Using a binary coding scheme in which visited pages are coded 1 and unvisited pages 0 one may create user based preference vectors and analyze statistically for both intra user and inter user cluster preferences or similarities. Other coding techniques may group certain sites along dimensions of commonality with navigation behavior analyzed using any number of Euclidean or other distance and or matching techniques. In embodiments user preference data may be collected from within the mobile subscriber characteristics database. In embodiments user preference data may be collected from outside of the mobile subscriber characteristics database. In embodiments off line behavior may also be used to characterize the preferences of the user.

An implicit mobile search query may be automatically generated from a mobile communication facility based at least on one parameter in order to deliver relevant mobile content to a mobile communication facility wherein the relevance may be based in part on information relating to a mobile communication facility .

The automatic generation of the search query may be an implicit search. This implicit search may not require user manipulation of a mobile communication facility command. For example a user may not need to select a menu item depress a button select a touch screen icon issue a voice command or explicitly employ other commands associated with a mobile communication facility .

In embodiments a parameter may be used to determine in part the relevancy of a mobile content. A parameter may be information relating to a mobile communication facility . This information may relate to a user characteristic. User characteristics may include a user s age sex race religion area code zip code home address work address billing address credit information family information income information birth date birthplace employer job title length of employment and other information associated with user characteristics. For example the user characteristic employer may be used to determine in part the relevancy of news headlines within a search result derived from an automatically generated search query of news headlines. If the user s employer was an automotive manufacturer news headlines relating to autoworker layoffs may be determined to be more relevant than headlines relating to currency fluctuations in China and thus prioritized for delivery to the user s mobile communication facility . Similarly the parameter of the user s employer might also result in the generation of a search query relating to the employer s current stock price and result in delivery of that information to the user s mobile communication facility .

In embodiments a parameter may also relate to a user history a user transaction a geographic location geographic proximity a user device a time and or other user characteristics. For example parameters relating to a user may include age 27 sex male previous user transactions purchase of a jazz recording and geographic location New York City . The automatically generated search may return search results that are ranked ordering indexed and or prioritized by their relevance to a user characteristic or plurality of user characteristics. In this example the fact that the user is a young male located in New York City with a history of purchasing jazz recordings may result in the prioritization of relevant content for delivery to the user s mobile communication facility such as retail establishments selling jazz recordings retail establishments selling jazz recordings within New York City retail establishments selling jazz recordings within walking distance of the user and so forth.

In embodiments a parameter may also include a mobile communication facility characteristic which may be selected from the group consisting of display capability display size display resolution processing speed audio capability video capability cache size storage capability memory capacity and other mobile communication facility characteristics. The information relating to a mobile communication facility may be provided by a wireless operator a wireless service provider a telecommunications service provider or other providers associated with a mobile communication facility . To further the previous example of the user who is a jazz aficionado if a new video is available of a jazz artist in concert the automatically generated query may determine whether the user s mobile communication facility has appropriate video capability and if so offer the user the opportunity to download the video.

In embodiments relevant mobile content may be locally cached on a mobile communication facility . The locally cached information may be loaded prior to new content associated with a new search query. The locally cached information may be associated with an expiration which may be a date a time a previous usage of the locally cached information or other characteristics governing expiration of the locally cached information. For example using the parameters of geographic location and time the automatically generated search query may return results containing the current day s weather conditions for that location. These results might be locally cached on a mobile communication facility with an expiration of 11 59 pm on that same day. In embodiments the prior viewing of a cached content such as a video may be used to determine a permitted future use of the content. For example a cached concert video from a jazz artist may be allowed to play five times on a mobile communication facility after which time it expires and requires the user to purchase the video in order to view it again.

In embodiments relevance may be based at least in part on a statistical association. The relevance may be a score. The statistical association may relate to an association between the mobile content and the information relating to a mobile communication facility . The information relating to a mobile communication facility may include a user history a user transaction a geographic location geographic proximity a user device a time a user characteristic or a mobile communication facility characteristic. A user characteristic may be selected from the group consisting of age sex race religion area code zip code home address work address billing address credit information family information income information birth date birthplace employer job title length of employment and other user characteristics. A mobile communication facility characteristic may be selected from the group consisting of display capability display size display resolution processing speed audio capability video capability cache size storage capability memory capacity and other mobile communication facility characteristics. For example a mobile communication facility may be associated with the parameters of a geographic location San Francisco a user history previous calls to Chinese restaurants and a time 7 pm . The mobile communication facility may automatically generate a search query and prioritize the presentation of content based on the relevancy of the content to a restaurant or a Chinese restaurant or having the location of San Francisco or being open for business at 7 pm or some combination of these.

In embodiments the information relating to a mobile communication facility may be provided by a wireless operator a wireless service provider a telecommunications service provider or other providers associated with a mobile communication facility .

In embodiments a basic implementation of a collaborative filtering algorithm entails tracking the popularity of a product service business transaction or website by recording the total number of users in the set that rate it favorably which may include a degree of favorability or by recording the number of users that repeatedly visit the site. In essence this algorithm assumes that what previous users liked new users will like. In embodiments a weighted averaging process is implemented to carve out subgroups of users who all highly ranked a product that has an overall unpopular rating with the overall user dataset.

A more robust collaborate filtering procedure sometimes referred to as the K nearest neighbor algorithm uses a training data set that is based upon previous users behavior to predict a variable of interest to members of a target data set comprised of new users. In addition to user preference data the training data set may have additional predictor variables such as might be contained in a mobile subscriber characteristics database e.g. age income sex date or place of birth etc. . Variables of interest may include type of product purchased amount of purchase and so forth. For each row single user data in the target data set the algorithm locates the K closest members of the training data set. Closeness or distance as used by the algorithm is generally a Euclidean Distance measure. Next the algorithm finds the weighted sum of the variable of interest for the K nearest neighbors where the weights are the inverse of the calculated distances. This process is then repeated for all remaining rows in the target set. From this information models may be derived for future prediction. As the user population increases the training data set may be updated to include new rows and thus capture any changes in user preference for use in revising the prediction model.

Other methods that may also be used successfully for statistical clustering of user preference groups include the weighted majority Bayesian prediction Pearson product correlation and factor analysis.

In addition to the description of collaborative filtering summarized above the following text may be referenced for more information relating to collaborative filtering and is incorporated herein by reference Nakamura A. and Abe N. 199898 395 403. Morgan Kaufman Eds. see Appendix A .

In addition to or instead of collaborative filtering or other preferential treatment of various information as determined by other methods non preferential or objective type data may be employed to further target search results about the user of a mobile communication facility . For example a location of the user may be determined through a GPS system or other location based service and this location may be used to filter results with or without the use of a collaborative filter. In embodiments elements such as time of day type of device activities associated with time of day activities associated with location invoice activity and the like may be used to further refine a search. In an embodiment such information may be used in a category style filter i.e. a filter designed to include or exclude results based on the data . In embodiments such information may be used by a collaborative filter algorithm. In embodiments such information may be used to filter results without being considered in the collaborative filter algorithm.

In embodiments data used in the process of obtaining search results refining search queries making corrections making suggestions disambiguating search queries categorizing results performing explicit or implicit searches filtering collaboratively filtering or performing other processes defined herein may be stored in a database e.g. a relational database . In embodiments the data may be mined associating linked extracted or otherwise manipulated or used. For more information relating to the association and mining of such data refer to the following document incorporated herein by reference by Sunita Sarawagi Shiby Thomas Rakesh Agrawal published by the IBM Almaden Research Center see Appendix B .

A recommendation system may use information from a user s profile to make predictions regarding other information products that might interest the user. Data used in the recommendation system may be obtained through the use of explicit and implicit data collection. Explicit collection refers to data collected from users who for example are directly rating items ranking products stating preferences listing favorites or least favorites etc. Implicit collection refers to data collected as for example a byproduct of user behavior such as products viewed in an online store or products purchased. The recommendation system may compare the collected data to similar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended items for the active user.

Suggestions may be generated for display based upon each keystroke the user enters into the mobile communication facility . Suggestions may be cached locally on the mobile communication facility and blended with the performance of server updates in order to optimize the overall performance of the wireless platform . Updates may also be provided to the cache memory of the mobile communication facility without requiring a user keystroke. Additional suggestions may be supplied to users by ranking content based upon popularity the frequency of query activity frequency within content the acceleration of the frequency of content the frequency of purchases the sales conversion rate as well as any changes that occur to any of these metrics. Suggestion lists can also be derived by de duping with frequent terms such as Tyra Banks out of 1 2 3 and categorizing for instance by title artist or a yellow pages type taxonomy or other subject matter organization. The suggestions may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic result facilities carrier business rules and or search algorithm facilities . Suggestions may be dynamically displayed in a Java or BREW application. Suggestions may also be presented in a browser. For example if a user types BR SP as their query the responding WAP page may ask the user if they intended on entering Britney Spears or Bruce Springsteen. Then the user may click on the link of the intended query.

Recommendations may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic result facilities carrier business rules and or sponsorship facility . Providing a recommendation to the user about other relevant content may be done either during search result display or after a search item has been selected. The relationships between items may be based on transactions searches and query behaviors and may include cross selling products e.g. recording artists within the same genre or offering users additional products and services e.g. offering a taxi service following a user s purchase of movie tickets in an urban setting . Query classification may use a yellow pages type taxonomy e.g. restaurants or physicians or for inferring that a five digit number is a postal zip code and may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic delivery facility disambiguation facility and or parental controls . The wireless platform may also use keyword mapping to a query classification based upon a taxonomy. For example a user query of screwdriver may map onto the category hardware. This keyword mapping may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic delivery facility disambiguation facility and or parental controls.

The results facility may include general content and services specific content catalogs carrier premium content carrier portal content device based results or home computer desktop search results. The general content and services provided in the results facility could be podcasts websites general images available online general videos available online websites transcoded for MCF or websites designed for mobile browser facilities. Specific content catalogs may include travel driving directions results displayed on a map white and yellow page telephone directories movie show times and reviews comparison shopping and product reviews weather stock quotes general knowledge questions word definitions a thesaurus restaurant reviews and reservations WiFi hotspot locations horoscopes area codes zip codes sports scores flight times fantasy sports statistics drink recipes pick up lines jokes information within a physical store e.g. inventory a mobile wallet an encyclopedia adult content gambling content and FAQ s. The carrier premium content provided in the results facility may include ringtones monophonic polyphonic or real tones ringback music streaming MP3 video games screensavers images designed for cell phones mobile books or other mobile applications. Carrier portal content includes news such as the current top stories entertainment business technology and finance and sports weather stock quotes and account information. Device based results provided in the results facility may include messaging such as SMS MMS and instant messaging email chat PIM address book and monetary services for a mobile wallet. Finally home computer desktop search results may include text documents Portable Document Format PDF documents maps in various formats including annotated maps or a similar facility spreadsheets presentations photos and images web pages email IM and chat.

Ordering and displaying search results may be based upon a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic delivery facility disambiguation facility parental controls search algorithm facilities carrier business rules and or a sponsorship facility . The ordering of content for display may also be based upon the amount of content available within a category. The display may be changed based upon the screen size of the mobile communication facility and sounds or other multimedia content may adapt to capabilities of the mobile communication facility . Ordering and display of content may be organized by the type of content the artist the date or concept e.g. Jaguar as a car or jaguar as an animal and other categories may derive from deduction within the mobile search host facilities . In addition to ordering content may be emphasized or deemphasized by weighting within the display . For example weighting may occur through the use of size motion lack of symmetry use of garish colors sounds multimedia or other means of accenting content. For sponsored links there may be opportunities for yield optimization e.g. clicks multiplied by the bid cost .

The parental controls function may be set up by the wireless provider at the time that the user account is created. A web based interface may be used for changing or modifying the parent controls and for entering changing the password protection. Alternatively the parental controls may also be managed via an interface contained within the mobile communication facility .

The privacy facility may include one or more facilities for protecting user privacy such as an encryption facility for encrypting sensitive user data. The privacy facility may also include a facility for protecting the user from undesired content such as unwanted commercial email spam spyware viruses or the like. A privacy facility may for example filter such content prior to revealing results or may in other embodiments suggest modified queries that are less likely to reveal a user s confidential information or that are less likely to return undesired content. A privacy facility may also function in a manner similar to a secure channel such as via VPN with a wireless provider . This secure channel may permit sensitive information to be shared securely.

The transactional security facility may contain additional privacy and parental control settings transactional security settings for the protection of wireless shopping and the management of digital rights. In embodiments such a facility may include password based security a public key private key facility or other suitable security protocol for ensuring the authenticity of the participants in a transaction that is executed using the mobile communications facility .

The carrier business rules of the wireless provider may be associated with or included in the mobile search host facilities . These rules may govern what content users may access e.g. walled garden vs. non walled garden where within the user interface sponsor logos and links are placed which sponsor facilities are included rules for the inventory of advertisements rules allowing categories of transactions by users e.g. based on access conditions employer controls parental controls or the like and managing auctions. In the instance of duplicate information occurring in a search result the preferred provider s content may be given priority over others.

In addition to voice recognition residing on the mobile communication facility it may be contained within the mobile search host facilities and use both software algorithms and hardware based solutions for accurate voice recognition.

The sponsorship facility stores premium content from sponsors that pay the wireless provider to display this content to relevant users. Sponsors information may link to a web site visited by the user i.e. pay per click or link to a call i.e. pay per call . Sponsor information may include information that is text only graphic information in the form of photographs graphic art designs or video as well as various combinations of these. Sponsor information may also take the form of an interactive software application i.e. a game or special ringtones e.g. jamtones . Sponsor information may be displayed to users based on the relation of the sponsor information and user search queries results lists items or categories and the websites visited by the user. Web pages may display content for syndicated ads or links for syndicated ads. Furthermore the wireless search platform illustrated in may contain the sorts of sponsor information described above in a separate database .

The implicit query facility provides for the display of relevant content to users based on user activities other than explicit search queries. For example in GPS data the locator facility may indicate that the cell phone user is in the vicinity of a sponsor s restaurant. In addition the clock contained in the mobile communication facility and or the wireless communication facility may indicate that it is mid evening. A predictive algorithm could merge this information and make the implicit query that the user is interested in restaurants in his immediate vicinity at which he could purchase dinner and then push content ads phone numbers menus reviews to his mobile communication facility for immediate display. Other implicit queries could similarly be based upon a user s parental controls the carrier business rules results facility and so forth either alone or in combination.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a server and database connected to the Internet. Databases connected to the wireless platform over the Internet may store information such as individual business websites with which the user transacts.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a database storing wireless carrier business rules . The carrier business rules may prioritize advertising content see walled garden content below based on the financial interests of the wireless provider or the importance of the sponsor . Additional carrier business rules may include those described herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a database storing walled garden content . Walled garden content may be content from which the wireless provider derives additional revenues based for example on user clickthroughs or content downloads e.g. ringtones wall paper ringbacks music videos . Because of this additional revenue the wireless provider through its carrier business rules may ensure that this advantageous content is given priority over search results that are equally relevant but do not have financial benefits for the wireless provider .

Once the initial explicit and or implicit query is made the query is processed and the initial results retrieved . Both the query and the initial retrieved results may undergo additional filtering and aggregation . Walled garden content and sponsored content may also attach to the query and present tailored results to the user. The results may also in turn trigger the posting of additional sponsor messages and advertisements. Information from pay per click PPC sponsors may link to the results making it possible for the user to quickly learn about sponsors services phone numbers addresses hours of operation sales and so forth. If the start of the query entry for example undergoes redirection it may either be routed back to the query stage or immediately present the user with the results based upon the query. Once results are retrieved but prior to display the content may be tested for compatibility with the user s mobile communication facility by using a spider to run mock compatibility trials during which it emulates the processing characteristics of a broad array of commercially available wireless communication facilities including the user s mobile communication facility type in order to determine the content within the result set that is compatible with the user s mobile communication facility .

The query results may be ordered prior to display based for example upon the sponsor mobile subscriber characteristics information relating to the mobile communication facility location carrier rules filter results and or walled garden priorities. Once the results are displayed the user may initiate interactions transactions with the information e.g. placing a call click on a link or an online order that is then delivered wirelessly through the wireless platform described in .

Referring back to a wireless communication facility may be an equipment enclosure antenna antenna support structure and any associated facility used for the reception or transmittal of a radio frequency microwave or other signal for communications. An antenna may include a system of poles panels rods reflecting discs or similar devices used for the transmission or reception of radio frequency signals. An antenna may be an omni directional antenna such as a whip antenna that transmits and receives radio frequency signals in a 360 degree radial pattern a directional antenna such as a panel antenna that transmits and receives radio frequency signals in a specific directional pattern of less than 360 degrees or a parabolic antenna such as a dish antenna a bowl shaped device for the reception and or transmission of radio frequency communication signals in a specific directional pattern. Other antennae that may be included in a wireless communication facility are accessory antenna devices such as test mobile antennas and global positioning antennas which are less than 12 inches in height or width excluding the support structure.

Other examples of devices that may comprise a wireless communication facility include a lattice tower a wireless communication support structure which consists of metal crossed strips or bars to support antennas and related equipment a monopole which is a wireless communication facility consisting of a support structure and related equipment including all equipment ancillary to the transmission and reception of voice and data. Such equipment may include but is not limited to cable conduit and connectors stanchions monopoles lattice towers wood poles or guyed towers.

A wireless provider may include any for profit non profit or governmental entity offering wireless communication services. A wireless provider may include services utilizing a broad array of wireless technologies and or spectra including but not limited to Cellular Advanced Wireless Services AWS Spectrum Broadband PCS Narrowband PCS Paging Wireless Communications WCS Wireless Medical Telemetry WMTS Specialized Mobile Private Land Mobile Maritime Mobile Low Power Radio Service LPRS Dedicated Short Range Communications DSRC 218 219 MHz 220 MHz 700 MHz Guard Bands Air Ground Amateur Aviation Basic Exchange Telephone Broadband Radio Service BRS Citizens Band CB Commercial Operators License Program Educational Broadband Service EBS Family Radio Service FRS General Mobile Radio Industrial Business Radio Pool Intelligent Transportation Systems ITS Instructional Television Fixed ITFS See Educational Broadband Service Lower 700 MHz Medical Implant Communications MICS Microwave Millimeter Wave 70 80 90 GHz Multipoint Distribution MDS MMDS Multi Use Radio Service MURS Offshore Personal Locator Beacons PLB Personal Radio Public Safety Radio Control Radio Service R C and Rural services.

A locator facility may work with the mobile communication facility in identifying the current geographic or other location of the mobile communication facility. A locator facility may for example be used to locate the geographic location of a wireless device through the use of geographically tagged personally identifiable data or personally identifiable data. Geographically tagged personally identifiable data describes personally identifiable data that is linked to a particular location through use of location based services. Personally identifiable data is information that can be used to identify a person uniquely and reliably including but not limited to name address telephone number e mail address and account or other personal identification number as well as any accompanying data linked to the identity of that person e.g. the account data stored by the wireless provider . In addition to or as an alternative to geographic location a locator facility may identify other locations such as proximity to other users proximity to a network location or position relative to other users e.g. in a line .

As described above mobile subscriber information may be stored in an accessible form in a mobile subscriber characteristics database . The information may be accessible directly from a mobile communication facility from the wireless provider or from another user and or handler of the information. In addition the mobile subscriber database may be loaded with information relating to a mobile communication facility a user of the mobile communication facility e.g. a customer of the wireless service provider and a wireless service provider or other source of useful information. The mobile subscriber information may be used in conjunction with a search for information on a mobile communication facility . For example the mobile subscriber information may be used to help better assess the desired search targets of a user using a mobile communication facility. In embodiments the user may perform a search based on key words or disambiguated corrected suggested or other terms as described herein and some or all of the mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in addition to the key words as a way of refining or customizing the search to the particular user. For example the user s age location time of day past mobile communication facility transactions e.g. phone calls clicks or click throughs may be used to predict what the user is more interested in. In embodiments the information that is predicted as valuable may be listed at the top of the search results they may be the only results produced or they may be highlighted in some way. The mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in connection with an algorithm facility for example. The mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in connection with a category filter or other filter used to refine search results according to such information.

By way of another example the mobile subscriber information stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database may be used in an implicit search as described in further detail herein. The wireless provider may gain information pertaining to the user s location time of day likes and dislikes e.g. through interpretation of other transactions e.g. phone activity or web activity related to the mobile communication facility and the wireless provider may facilitate the downloading of apparently relevant information to the mobile communication facility in anticipation of the user s desire for such information. For example a location facility may locate the mobile communication facility. The location may be associated with the time of day at which the location was obtained. The location information may be associated with the other mobile subscriber characteristic information through a phone number associated with the mobile communication facility. The location may be Harvard Square in Cambridge Mass. The time may be 6 30 p.m. and the user may have called Chinese restaurants ten times over the past two months at about this same time. This may be determined based on previous queries or by history of phone calls that may then be reverse searched to check for relevance to future queries.

With this information the system may make an inference that the user is interested in dinner at a Chinese restaurant and download information pertaining to such in the area of Harvard Square. In addition information pertaining to dinner categories or other results may be presented. In embodiments this collection of user relevant information may be used in connection with sponsor information stored in the sponsor database and some or all of the results presented to the user may be sponsored information. The sponsor information may be the result of a search result auction based on the user relevant information or the sponsor information may be related to local restaurants wherein the sponsored link is a pay per call sponsored link for example.

There are many ways in which the mobile subscriber characteristic information can be used in a mobile communication facility search for information whether it is an explicit implicit or other form of search and several such embodiments are presented in more detail below.

As described above the sponsor database may store sponsor information in an accessible form in the sponsor database to be used in the searching for information presentation of information accessing of information or other activity associated with the mobile communication facility . In embodiments the sponsor information may be used to present syndicated sponsor links advertising content or other information on the mobile communication facility .

A sponsored result may be presented to the user of a mobile communication facility as a result of an auction for advertising space on the mobile communication facility . The auction may be keyword based term based phrase based algorithm based or some other system of associating information a site content and the like with a search query or inquiry. For example the user of a mobile communication facility may conduct a network search by entering a search query and the query or some related form of the query e.g. a disambiguation of the query correction of the query suggestion related to the query may be processed through an auction in which the highest bidder for the auction receives an elevated right to advertise its content. The content may be presented as a sponsored link on a display associated with the mobile communication facility. The sponsored link may be highlighted prioritized or otherwise presented. In embodiments the sponsored information may be presented on a site visited by the mobile communication facility user. For example the user may click on a link other than the sponsored link. Once the website content is displayed on the mobile communication facility information relating to the sponsored link may also be displayed offering another chance for the user to click on the sponsored link.

In embodiments a user of the mobile communication facility may perform a search for information or a search for relevant information may be performed in anticipation of the user desiring such information e.g. an implicit search and included in the results presented may be a sponsored link content or other information. The sponsored content may be the result of an auction e.g. a keyword based auction algorithm based auction location based auction mobile subscriber characteristics based auction or combination auction wherein information such as from the search query is combined with other information such as location or mobile subscriber characteristics and it may be presented and displayed on a display associated with the mobile communication facility in a prioritized manner highlighted manner exclusive manner or presented in some other manner.

In embodiments sponsor information may be presented to a mobile communication facility as the result of an auction. In embodiments sponsor information may be presented as a pay per call link or content. In a pay per call embodiment there may not have been an auction for the right to post the information on the mobile communication facility . The information may have been presented because it appeared relevant or for some other reason. In such situations the user of the mobile communication facility may be presented with a special phone number associated with the sponsor. When the special number is called the receiver of the call e.g. a vendor of goods or services is presented with an option to receive the call and pay a commission to the poster of the information e.g. the wireless service provider or decline the call. In another somewhat similar scenario the vendor may be allowed to accept the first call for free or pay for billed for the call later but have to accept such charges in the future if referrals are desired. The user of the mobile communication facility may store the sponsored or referred phone number in an address book of the mobile communication facility and every time the number is called the wireless service provider may be paid for the referral. In embodiments the referral sponsor fee may go down with use go up with use or remain stable with use. In embodiments the referral sponsor fee may change with time or other parameters. In embodiments a pay per call number is the result of an auction process. Advertising syndication may be segmented by mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristics delivery facilities and or parental controls .

An aspect of the present invention relates to a syndication program where mobile content may be added to a website when the website is presented to a mobile communication facility e.g. a cell phone . Such syndication may be decided by the wireless operator wireless service provider telecommunications provider or may be at the decision of the website owner through an opt in process. The opt in process may involve signing up with a wireless provider mobile search provider or other related entity. The opt in process may also involve the insertion of a tag on the website. Mobile content may automatically be added to website pages for a specified URL or plurality of URLs. The addition of mobile content may be done without an indication on the page of where mobile content should be placed. A tag or other coded information may be included in the website to indicate where on the site the mobile content should be placed when delivered to a mobile communication facility. The syndication process may be context based relevancy behavioral based relevancy or it may be based on a combination of the two techniques to associate relevant mobile content with the site. A server application e.g. a WAP server application WAP Gateway Mobile Application Gateway and the like may automatically add mobile content to a website when delivering it to a mobile communication facility whether or not the website is tagged. The mobile content may involve a web content placement auction or other process for determining which content will be associated with keywords topics websites and the like during the presentation.

Automatic syndication of mobile content to a website may be based at least in part on using contextual information associated with the website in order to determine the relevancy of mobile content that is available for syndication. Contextual information that may be associated with a website may include keywords terms or phases located on the website the inbound links to the website the outbound links from the website click patterns and clickthroughs associated with the website including click patterns and clickthroughs associated with sponsored content appearing on the website metadata website usage patterns including time duration depth and frequency of website usage the website host search verticals relating to the website and other indicia of website context.

The contextual information relating to a website may be associated with mobile content that is available for syndication and presentation to the website based at least in part on relevance. Mobile content available for syndication may derive from a pool of mobile content sponsors participating in a contextual syndication program provided by a wireless operator wireless service provider telecommunications provider mobile search provider and the like. Alternatively mobile content available for syndication may derive from outside of a contextual syndication program and be used for generating a mobile sponsor campaign for presentation to a potential participant in a contextual syndication program.

The relevancy of the contextual information associated with a website and the mobile context available for syndication may be indicated through the use of a relevancy score. The relevancy score may be a numerical summary of the statistical association between contextual website data parameters and mobile content parameters. The relevancy score may be a proprietary score assigned to a mobile content by a wireless operator wireless service provider mobile search provider or telecommunications service provider. The contextual data parameters associated with websites may be standardized in a list. Mobile content may receive a relevancy score for each element in the contextual data parameters list. For example a mobile content such as a ringtone download advertisement may receive a relevancy score for each of a plurality of websites. Entertainment websites may receive a higher relevancy score than the Weather websites. Similarly the contextual information of an inbound link relating to Music may receive a higher relevancy score than an inbound link relating to Pets. A mobile content relating to a ringtone derived from a popular Chinese language song may receive a higher relevancy score for the contextual information of Server Host China than for Server Host Argentina. Contextual information parameters Keyword Ringtone or Keyword Music Download could also be scored as highly relevant to syndicated mobile content relating to ringtones and so forth. The relevancy scores of a syndicated mobile content may be stored in a mobile content relevance dictionary.

A program of automatically syndicating mobile content to a website may be based upon the relevance of the mobile content to the contextual information associated with the website. The automation of syndicating mobile content may be based at least in part on associating electronic information associated with a website e.g. metadata . Contained within the metadata may be information regarding the relevance of the website s contextual data parameters with mobile content data parameters. Examples of only a few of the many examples of how a metadata may contain relevance information include metadata indicating relevance to the website e.g. Ringtones metadata indicating the minimum relevancy score associated with a contextual data parameter that is required for syndicating a mobile content to the website and the like. The metadata may communicate with the mobile content relevance dictionary in order to identify receive and present relevant mobile content to a website.

In embodiments an entity associated with a website may be able to opt into an automated syndication program. The opt in may be done in association with a wireless operator wireless service provider mobile search provider or telecommunications provider. The opt in may be done through a self service website through an entity conducting the automated syndication program through a ground mailed solicitation phone call solicitation through a website tag and the like. Once an entity associated with a website has opted into the program the automated syndication program may associate an electronic tag within the entity s website in order to commence the automated syndication. The automated syndication program may operate in conjunction with a WAP server WAP Gateway Mobile Application Gateway remote server a server that is serving pages to a mobile communication facility e.g. phone and the like. In embodiments the opt in process involves tagging the target website with a syndication indication tag. For example a website operator may tag the website and each of its associated pages with a syndication indication tag indicating that it is to be syndicated when presented to a mobile communication facility e.g. phone . The tag may also indicate the position of the mobile content on the page. Opt in websites may choose not to insert a tag and allow the mobile content to appear automatically on the page. A server application designed for downloading the website to the mobile communication facility e.g. a WAP server WAP gateway Mobile Application Gateway and the like may read websites looking for the syndication indication tag or may associate the website location with a database of URLs that have requested to participate opt in . Once the server confirms the site is to include syndicated mobile content the server may automatically add mobile content to the website. The process of tagging the site may involve going to a wireless provider site or mobile search provider site to obtain the proper tag. In embodiments the tag may be provided by any number of different entities or sources. For example the tag may be provided by a third party tagging website. In embodiments the format of the tag may be known and a site administrator may insert the tag.

The automated syndication program may be a flat fee revenue sharing or no fee service program offered to an entity of a website. The automated syndication program may involve a split fee service program offered to an entity of a website in which the entity shares revenues with the wireless operator wireless service provider telecommunications provider mobile search provider conducting the automated syndication program server service provider and or other entities involved in the transaction. Fees may be derived from sponsors of mobile content participating in the automated syndication program. The fees derived from the sponsors of mobile content competitive bidding process auction flat fee service or the like. The fee structure and bidding may be based on the relevancy score associated with a data parameter.

In embodiments a website may be tagged for syndication and there may be no fee a flat fee a revenue sharing arrangement or other arrangement made when a server application syndicates the webpage. The content used to syndicate the website may have been provided through the an auction or other such arrangement and the fees received for the syndication application may be shared with a number of entities including the site owner the wireless provider delivering the site to the mobile communication facility the server operator and or other entities involved in the transaction.

Alternatively mobile content syndicated to a website may include a search box that may allow for searching the website alone or a set of content broader than the website alone.

As described above for an automatic syndication program based upon contextual information associated with a website so too may an automatic syndication program be based upon behavioral information relating to a user of a mobile communication facility. Within an automated syndication program based upon behavioral information the relevancy scores of mobile content may be based on a user s behavioral data parameters including but not limited to at least one of a user history transaction history geographic location user device time mobile subscriber characteristic mobile communication facility characteristic and or other such user information as described herein. A mobile communication facility may be a phone a mobile phone a cellular phone and a GSM phone.

While many of the embodiments herein have been described in connection with a syndicated website it should be understood that the techniques apply to other forms of network content as well. For example the techniques may be used for the syndication of a webpage portion of a webpage an image video movie skin graphical user interface program interface web content downloadable content and other such content.

In embodiments the carrier rules database includes information relating to search techniques search methodologies locations for searchable content walled garden rules out of garden rules out of network searching rules in network searching rules search result presentation rules sponsor presentation rules sponsor search rules sponsor rules content presentation rules and other information and rules pertaining to the search display ordering and or presentation of information on the mobile communication facility .

Carrier business rules may provide guidance on how for example a search term is to be disambiguated or corrected what search terms should be suggested as a result of an entered or submitted query how results and in what order results should be presented or how sponsors should be selected and or presented. The carrier business rules may provide guidance about when to search in network databases e.g. walled garden content and when to search out of network databases e.g. database through server . For example a wireless provider may want to cause users of mobile communication facilities to order music videos ringtones wallpaper screensavers and the like from an in network database of walled garden content while the wireless provider may want current news to come from an out of network source. The wireless provider may then set these rules and store them in a carrier business rules database . These rules can then be accessed by the wireless provider or optionally from the mobile communication facility or other related facility during the search presentation or ordering or other parameter according to the present invention.

A walled garden database may be associated with a wireless provider and a mobile communication facility according to an aspect of the present invention. The walled garden refers to subset of carrier business rules that determine the type of access to wireless content that a user is permitted. The walled garden may limit the scope of permitted content to a pre defined content set that is determined by the wireless provider . For example a wireless provider may license content from third parties and offer the provider s subscribers a bundled package of the licensed content while restricting access to other content. The wireless provider may direct the content layout authentication royalty tracking and reporting billing quality of service etc. through the provider s carrier business rules or this function may be outsourced to a third party. The walled garden permits a wireless provider to offer its subscribers a suite of content as part of the subscriber s wireless basic account thereby eliminating the need for the subscriber to individually pay for discrete licensed products within the licensed content package. The walled garden restricts the choice of content that is available to subscribers. Typically the wireless provider is compensated for content distribution in a form of revenue split between itself and the licensed content providers.

Related to the walled garden model of content distribution is the gated garden model. In the gated garden the wireless provider may create a virtual toll gate through which third parties may offer their proprietary content to the wireless provider s subscribers. In exchange the wireless provider shares in the revenues derived from its subscribers accessing the third party content. Unlike the walled garden in the gated garden model the wireless provider typically does not assume responsibility for the content or customer service related to problems accessing the content.

The algorithm facility may perform algorithms of all types including algorithms for combining information relating to a search ordering results from a search or displaying results sponsoring results and the like. For example an algorithm facility may include an algorithm to define how to incorporate the mobile subscriber characteristics into a search query entered on the mobile communication facility . The algorithm may for example determine what information to use in combination with a search query what information to use in an implicit search what weight to provide to the various parts of the search e.g. location receives a high weight in an implicit search what sponsors are acceptable how results should be ordered how results should be displayed e.g. highlighted and or determine other parameters related to the search. An algorithm facility may also include sponsorship algorithms algorithms related to auctions algorithms related to pay per click algorithms related to pay per call or other algorithms related to the development of a search as described herein.

The algorithm facility may be a software tool used for evaluating a number of possible solutions based upon a user query. The set of all possible solutions may be called the search space. In general uninformed searching may employ brute force searching or na ve search algorithms for relatively simple direct traversal of the search space. By contrast informed search algorithms may use heuristics to apply knowledge about the structure of the search space during a search. Potential algorithms that may be used in the algorithm facility include but are not limited to the uninformed search informed search tree search list search adversarial search constraint satisfaction genetic search probabilistic search simulated annealing string search taboo search and or federated search.

A parental control facility may be a software based means of restricting access to certain types of user defined objectionable content. The parent control facility may include multi level and or dynamic web filtering technology to filter and block out inappropriate content. The parental control facility may link to other features of the wireless search platform or mobile communication facility . For example the parental control facility may upon blocking objectionable content send an email notification or cell phone alert about inappropriate web browsing instant messaging and chat sessions etc. Comprehensive log reports can summarize a child s activities. The parental control facility may also include the means to control the total time that a user is permitted to use a mobile communication facility or the Internet filter web based email accounts block objectionable pop up ads etc.

A voice recognition facility may be a software component enabling a machine or device e.g. a cellular phone to understand human spoken language and to carry out spoken commands. Typically a human voice is received by the device and converted to analog audio. The analog audio may in turn be converted into a digital format using for example an analog to digital converter which digital data may be interpreted using voice recognition techniques. Generally this is done through the use of a digital database storing a vocabulary of words or syllables coupled with a means of comparing this stored data with the digital voice signals received by the device. The speech patterns of a unique user may be stored on a hard drive locally or remotely or other memory device and may be loaded into memory in whole or in part when the program is run. A comparator may use for example correlation or other discrete Fourier transform or statistical techniques to compare the stored patterns against the output of the analog digital converter.

The capacity of a voice recognition facility such as vocabulary speed and length of digital samples that can be analyzed may be constrained by hardware capabilities of the voice recognition facility such as memory capacity sampling rates and processing speed as well as the complexity of algorithms used for comparisons.

An implicit query facility may automatically generate context sensitive queries based on a user s current activities characteristics and or the user s device characteristics. For example the implicit query facility may retrieve Internet links music files e mails and other materials that relate to an active user s query but which the user did not specifically query. Other data linked to the user s mobile communication facility for example geographic location obtained from the locator facility may be used to initiate an implicit query for stores in the user s general facility that based on the user s previous Internet usage are of likely interest to the user. An implicit query facility may gather and download content onto the mobile communication facility in anticipation of a mobile communication facility user s desire for such information. This technique of providing results in advance of the search query may be used to increase speed of content delivery for example.

A client application interface may be associated with a mobile communication facility . The client application interface may be a software program operating through a processor and operating system on the mobile communication facility and the program may facilitate processes used in the mobile communication facility and or generate information through the display . The client application interface may perform a number of functions associated with the processes and devices as described herein. For example the client application interface may produce the search query entry facility operate in association with a voice activation facility operate in association with transmission and reception circuitry on the mobile communication facility operate in association with mobile host facilities produce a graphical user interface on the mobile communication facility or perform other functions related to the mobile communication facility and or systems and processes as disclosed herein. The client application interface may perform several functions such as producing a graphical user interface on the mobile communication facility. Another function may be expanding a line item e.g. a category a download configuration or option etc. when a cursor or other interface is hovering on the item or otherwise interacting with the item. Another function may be to represent a hierarchy by a visual cue e.g. with an arrow multifaceted arrow plus sign or the like with the sub items appearing below when the visual cue is selected. Another function may be representing a hierarchy as line items with selection scrolling in another screen with the sub items. Another function may be to provide instrumentation to allow for tracking of user clicks just as web pages would be tracked for click patterns. Another function may be using a camera associated with the mobile communication facility to track phone movement as a method for navigating on the screen e.g. scrolling up down left right on a picture map or text to facilitate selection of an item or the like . Another function may be to provide smooth visual transitions e.g. hierarchy screen movements and expanding line item which may provide further visual indication thereby increasing usage and sales. Another function may be to provide tool tips for icons. The tool tips may be presented after a predetermined hover time is achieved or there may be a visual cue near an action icon for example. Another function may be to download suggestions in the background while cached suggestions are already displayed. Another function may be to download suggestions to display next to cached suggestions. Another function may be to cache results e.g. operate similarly to suggestions . Another function may be to operate with preinstalled cached suggestions. Another function may be to perform software update notification wherein the user may have the option to update. Another function may be to present notifications. Such notifications may be phased in to prevent millions of handsets from trying to update at the same time for example. The client application interface may be designed to handle multiple mobile communication facility variations without requiring different versions of the software. The client application interface may generate a gradient shading and or dithering to give color depth without putting a bitmap in the application. This may be provided to reduce the application size to facilitate downloads e.g. increase speed of downloads . Another function may be to provide multi lingual support. Another function may be to allow a user to send to a friend results or an item result e.g. this may apply to any of the delivery facilities presented herein . Another function may be to provide pagination for results to increase page load speed and minimize network costs. Another function may be to search history stored locally to allow quick access from every list screen. The client application interface may be designed to incorporate carrier branding and the carrier branding may be in color and a logo may be presented. Another function may be to provide different data transfer modes to allow for different mobile communication facilities carrier network speeds user data plans or other situations. Another function may be to provide a thin visual cue for background network activity without taking significant screen real estate and allowing for continued interactivity of application. Another function may be to provide a skinnable search application whose arrangement and or appearance may be customized or the client application interface may be locally skinnable. Another function may be to provide a dynamic font selection and display based on information relating to the mobile communication facility . Another function may be to provide a dynamic screen reformatting based on information relating to the mobile communication facility . Another function may be to provide for entry of a general topic with categories and associated results displayed to allow for selection of the rest of the query without having to type in the entire query on a limited Query Entry Facility . Another function may be to provide or associate with a dynamic cache size based on information relating to the mobile communication facility capabilities. Another function may be to pre download information through search experience e.g. downloading results in background before selecting content type . Another function may be to provide high speed and low speed network communication based on changing data usage pattern or on other factors e.g. processing more transactions in the background when the mobile communication facility is associated with a slow network . Another function may be to provide query composition using a combination of suggestions. The client application interface may perform other functions as needed on the mobile communication facility in connection with the functions and facilities outlined herein as well as other conventional functions of the mobile communication facility . Another function may be to use dynamic memory management specifically using more or less memory for previous screens pre fetched information or cached data based on the capabilities of the device and based on the other memory demands of the device such as other applications or content on the phone. Another function may be to automatically update the application with the user s permission. This particular function may be deployed in a phased manner that does not force all devices do not require updating at the same time.

In a wireless search platform a mobile communication facility may include a cache such as a cache memory or a portion of a memory organized as a cache. The memory may be a hard drive a static memory or a non volatile memory. The memory may be permanently installed in the mobile communication facility or may be removable such as a memory card.

The cache may contain suggestions such as mobile content which may be accessed and presented on a display of the mobile communication facility as a result of an action by a user of the mobile communication facility . The cached information may also be accessed and presented as a result of an action by a provider of services to the mobile communication facility or by an automated application running on the mobile communication facility . Suggestions may be cached locally on the mobile communication facility and blended with the performance of network updates to facilitate optimizing the overall performance of the wireless platform .

Data stored in the cache may be input directly by the user e.g. a user name address search query . Alternatively the data stored in the cache may be transferred from the mobile network from a server wireless provider or a mobile search host facility . The cached data may be compressed prior to transmission to the mobile communication facility and may be decompressed after receipt on the mobile communication facility . The data may be decompressed upon receipt or may be decompressed as the data is accessed to be presented.

The cached data may be mobile content such as sponsored content a sponsored link a sponsored call downloadable content an audio stream a video a graphic element an index such as a yellow pages or a white pages. Caching mobile content facilitates fast access and display of the content when needed to reply to a user query or input.

A client application interface of the mobile communication facility may download suggestions in the background while cached suggestions are displayed. Another client application interface function may be to download and display network suggestions next to cached suggestions. The client application interface may cache search results e.g. operate similarly to caching suggestions or it may operate with preinstalled cached suggestions.

Suggestions information and mobile content to be downloaded to the mobile communication facility may be generated by a server or mobile search host facility by ranking content based upon popularity the frequency of query activity frequency within content the acceleration of the frequency of content the frequency of purchases the sales conversion rate as well as any changes that occur to any of these metrics.

Suggestions may be retrieved from the cache in response to a query input by the user. If the cache cannot provide a full list of suggestions a request may be sent to a server or a mobile search host facility . However a request for suggestions may be sent by the mobile communication facility independent of the amount of relevant suggestions in the cache. This facilitates keeping the cached suggestions updated. These updated suggestions may be displayed along with the cached suggestions and then the updated suggestions may be cached to speed up future suggestions. The updated suggestions may supplement or replace the previously cached suggestions. The previously cached suggestions may be replaced if the new suggestions are ranked higher.

Suggestions content and other information cached on the mobile communication facility may be identified with a date stamp or time stamp of caching. A function of the client application interface may be to request updates to cached information based on the age of the cached information. As an example such a function may ensure that cached suggestions are updated every 48 hours or sooner.

To effectively use the cache memory resources of the mobile communication facility a server may reply to a request for an update of cached suggestions with information that indicates the cached suggestions no longer rank high enough relative to other suggestions or user characteristics to continue to be stored on the mobile communication facility . In such an example the client application interface may delete the appropriate cached information such that it will not appear in response to future searches or queries freeing up the memory for other uses. Upon detecting a query to which the server indicates cached information is obsolete the server may also download new suggestions information content or the like to the mobile communication facility for caching.

Suggestions mobile content or information may be downloaded to the cache of a mobile communication facility through an explicit search or through an implicit search. An example of an explicit search includes a user entering a search query in the user interface of a mobile communication facility and requesting a search. An implicit search includes search activity performed either as a result of a query by the client application interface of the mobile communication facility without a user query entry or by one or more applications running on the server or the mobile search host facility . Implicit searches may be triggered based on a schedule based on a change in location of a mobile communication facility and based on the age of the cached information in the mobile communication facility cache memory. As an example a user s location may change such as when a user travels to a different city. This change in location may trigger an implicit search of local restaurants meeting a criteria established based on prior user behavior perhaps including other users behavior upon entering this location.

The presentation of information such as cached suggestions may be the result of user search query. If there is a matching relationship between the search query and the previously downloaded results in the mobile communication facility cache the previously downloaded results may be presented. The user may perceive this as a very fast search or a high bandwidth connection because the search results are presented from a memory of the mobile communication facility .

Cached suggestions may also be presented to a user even if the user cannot connect to the wireless network enabling the user to gain access to important network information which has been cached on the user s mobile communication facility .

The cached information may be presented in categorized groups in thumbnail format or in a preview format such as an audible ring tone preview a text excerpt a video excerpt or an audio file excerpt.

A client application interface may process or cause processes to occur in the background. For example in embodiments results may be presented to the mobile communication facility as they are retrieved without waiting for the entire result set to be retrieved. In embodiments certain results may be presented and displayed while other results are in the process of being presented or displayed. This background processing of results may increase the speed at which some results can be presented to a mobile communication facility . In embodiments certain categories of results may be presented to the mobile communication facility before other categories. For example images may take longer to download process and or collect as compared to ringtones so the category of ringtones or individual ringtones may be presented to the mobile communication facility before or while the image results or image category is presented.

For example a user may provide a query entry Coltrain that is sent through a wireless communication facility so that the query assistance facility may begin. Because the query assistance facility is linked to other data sources as part of the correction process information from the filter algorithm facility may be linked to the query entry to provide more information to be used in the process of producing a more useful search query. In this example the user s filter algorithm facility may use information such as a history of online purchases product names numbers purchase amounts and purchase dates and times. Within the databases associated with the filter algorithm facility there may be a history of many recent purchases of compact discs recorded by the saxophonist John Coltrane. Because the original user query entry Coltrain is not a known word the query assistance facility may predict a correction taking into account user specific data contained in the purchase history of the filter algorithm facility such as that the user seeks information pertaining to Coltrane as opposed to Coal Train or Soul Train etc. In various embodiments or particular user searches within one embodiment the query assistance facility may involve one of these additional data facilities a plurality of the data facilities or none of the data facilities.

It is possible that a user s query entry returns a null result set or an improbable result set. In this case the search facility in conjunction with the mobile communication facility could automatically trigger correction and iteratively cycle through alternative query entries until a non null or higher probability result set is delivered.

In embodiments additional recommendations may be made following a user s query entry based upon the information related to the mobile communication facility. For example mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules or sponsor information in conjunction with the query entry may suggest relevant recommendations for the user. The recommendations may be paired with the query entry search results or presented prior to or following the display of the search results.

A user s prior search activities and search results may also be used to create recommendations for the user. Prior search activities may include transactions search queries visits to websites and other acts initiated by the user on the mobile communication facility. The geographic location of the mobile communication facility may foster recommendations including but not limited to sponsor information e.g. products and services in the user s current geographic vicinity. The current time may be used independently or in conjunction with other information to create user recommendations. For example the independent fact that it is noon may create recommendations for restaurants serving lunch. This information may be further filtered by the location of the mobile communication facility to recommend only those restaurants that are in the user s immediate vicinity and further filtered by the subscriber s characteristics to recommend only that subset of restaurants serving lunch in the user s current vicinity that have received high ratings by restaurant patrons with a demographic profile similar to the user s. As with the above restaurant example similar processes for generating meaningful recommendations may be applied to other services and products including transportation food theater sports entertainment movies corporations work banks post offices mail facilities location of and directions to gas stations taxis buses trains cars airports baby sitters and other service and goods providers such as drug stores drive through restaurants bars clubs times of movies and entertainment news and local information.

Various aspects of the assisted query formulation may be activated or de activated under user or provider control. For example a user with a particular search such as a phone number for a particular individual may wish to suppress corrections or suggestions that might be generated with assisted query formulation which might otherwise try to replace a correct but unusual name spelling with more conventional or popular subject matter. Thus in one aspect a user interface for an assisted query formation system may include controls for selectively activating various ones of the tools available to the system. The tools may include for example the recommendations predictions disambiguations categorizations and the like discussed above. In another aspect a service provider such as the wireless provider or mobile communication facility described above may offer selected ones of the tools as value added services that may be provided to select customers such as full service or premium customers or offered on an a la carte basis individually or in packages. In such embodiments query assistance may be requested by a customer using e.g. a web site cellular phone data access or telephone voice access and may be requested on a subscription basis such as recurring monthly or on a daily or per search basis.

In embodiments the methods and systems disclosed herein can be adapted to provide an optimized search based on mobile subscriber characteristics including any of the characteristics described herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. Thus these methods and systems may include providing a search function adapted for a mobile device and adapting the search function based on characteristics of the subscriber of the mobile device wherein the subscriber characteristics are derived at least in part from a mobile subscriber data facility that is maintained by a carrier of mobile device services.

In embodiments the adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action related to initiation processing or completion of a search or presentation of search results.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on age. The age adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example a mobile communication facility may have an implicit query running so that upon viewing a user interface of the mobile communication facility the user sees results of a query that is automatically pre formulated for the user. The implicit query may be based on the age of the user such as running the query most frequently run by persons of similar age on the same day. For example a teenager might have an implicit query that relates to a music group or movie an adult might have an implicit query that relates to major new headlines and a retired person might have an implicit query that relates to information relevant to financial markets. An age adapted search function may also operate in connection with an active query for example a given query may return results that are age appropriate age filtered age ranked or age disambiguated. For example entering Pink might return results for Pink Floyd if the user is over age 30 while it might return results for the female artist Pink if the user is under 30. A user might be prompted to resolve such an ambiguity or the ambiguity might be automatically resolved for the user. Thus an age adapted search function may be provided for a mobile communication facility. In embodiments the age of the user may be obtained from a mobile subscriber data facility that stores mobile subscriber characteristics .

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on gender. The gender adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Gender may be determined by reference to a database that stores mobile subscriber characteristics such as a database of a carrier of wireless services. A gender adapted search function may for example inform an implicit query such as presenting results of the searches that are most popular for that gender for that day. Similarly results may be disambiguated by a disambiguation process that is informed by gender. For example the search process might run a query on a database of female oriented sites if the user is female while running a query on male oriented sites if the user is male. Similarly a disambiguation process may filter results based on gender. For example a query such as uprights might return results for vacuum cleaners for a female user while returning results for football kickers for a male user.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on ethnicity. The ethnicity adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example an implicit query may generate results that are most popular among members of an ethnic group. A search or query formation process may search for results that relate to a targeted ethnic group. A disambiguation process either upon query formation or upon result retrieval or presentation may disambiguate based on ethnicity. For example a query related to paris might return results for Paris France for a French person while returning results for Paris Hilton for an American. Ethnicity information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics or it might be entered by the user in the user interface.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on religion or cultural affinity. The religion adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The information may be obtained from a mobile subscriber characteristics database either obtained by a carrier based on application or transactions or inferred based on past behavior or searches of the user. The religion adapted search function may for example run implicit queries that are most popular among members of the same religious affiliation. A religion adapted disambiguation facility may disambiguate queries based on religious affiliation. For example a query for Muhammed might return information about the prophet for members of Islamic religions while it might return information about the boxer for those who don t have religious affiliations.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on area code. The area code adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example a user with a given area code could receive implicit query results based on other searches by members of the same area code. Also queries may be disambiguated or results filtered sorted or presented based on area code or other location information . For example a user entering Paris in the 270 area code might receive results for Paris Tenn. a user entering Paris in the 310 area code might receive results for Paris Hilton and a user entering the same word in the 617 area code might receive results for Paris France.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on home address. The address adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. As with the area code adapted search function example above the implicit query disambiguation or results can be varied based on the location of the user s home address information that can be obtained from for example a carrier s database of mobile subscriber characteristics .

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on work address. The work address adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example a user may see results of an implicit query that is the same as other queries from the user s employer such as press releases that mention the employer. A disambiguation facility may resolve ambiguity including with help of the user based on work address. For example a user with a work address at a location of General Electric might receive search results on that company when entering the term light in a search engine while a user with a different work address might receive results relating to lighting products. Again the work address information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as maintained by a carrier of wireless services.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on billing address. The billing address adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The billing address information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as may be maintained by a carrier of wireless services. The billing address adapted search function may for example present implicit query results similar to those of other users with the same billing address such as queries relevant to the business enterprise that exists at that billing address . Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results filtered sorted presented or routed based on billing address. For example a user with a billing address at a location of a large company may be presented with results that relate to that company while a user with a residential address as the billing address may receive results that are tailored to users in the general area of that location.

In embodiments information about the user s home address area code billing address or other location information may be combined with information about a user s current location as determined by a location facility such as to determine whether a user is in proximity to the user s home or workplace. If so a user may receive query results suitable for one of those environments such as receiving work related information while at work and consumer information while at home . If the user is far from home and work then the user may receive by implicit query or as a result of a search results that are pertinent to travel in the location where the user is located such as hotel car rental and restaurant information. Similarly an away from home user may have an implicit query formed or a partial query disambiguated based on the user s status as a traveler. For example a partial entry for hot might return shopping bargains for a user close to home while it might return hotels for a user who is traveling.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on credit card information. The credit card information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The credit card information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics or from a credit card provider. The information may include information relating to current balances credit limits or the like. For example an implicit query may present results based on the available credit balance for a user such as presenting searches or results for expensive goods for a user who has a low balance and high credit limit while presenting searches or results for financial counselors for users who have high balances and low credit limits.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on passwords. The password adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Thus a mobile search facility may include a password protected search capability such as allowing searches for certain types of content only if the user enters the correct password. For example walled garden content like ringtones or video clips might be available only if the user enters a password that is stored in the database of mobile subscriber characteristics .

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on family information e.g. mother s maiden name number of siblings marital status or the like . The family information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example an implicit search may be running that presents searches or results that are similar to those recently run by family members or friends of the user. A disambiguation process may operate based on family information such as resolving ambiguity in queries based on searches conducted by family members or based on the status of the family. Similarly results may be filtered sorted presented or routed based on family information. For example a search for the term custody might lead to results on child custody for a divorced user while it might reveal information on trust and custody accounts for a married user.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on birthplace. The birthplace adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Thus an implicit search based on birthplace may include searches or results that are similar to those of other users with the same birthplace or users currently located in proximity to the birthplace. Similarly results may be filtered or queries disambiguated based on birthplace. For example entering derby may retrieve results relating to horse racing for users born in Kentucky while it may retrieve results relating to hats for users born elsewhere.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on driver s license information. The license information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. License information may include age and address information which may be used as contemplated by the various age and location based search function examples provided herein. License information may also include height weight hair color eye color vision status and the like. For example a user may be presented results that are similar to those of persons of similar appearance.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on employment data. The position adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The employment data may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a carrier of wireless services. The employment data may for example indicate a user s status as an officer of a company as an employee of a certain type e.g. sales and marketing supply chain management finance human resources or the like or level e.g. associate manager vice president etc. length of employment or other status. For example an implicit query may present results similar to those for searches run by users holding similar positions in other companies. Similarly a query may be disambiguated or a result retrieved sorted filtered presented or routed based on the user s position. For example a sales manager entering incentive might receive information on promotions related to his employer s products while a human resources manager might receive information relating to employee incentive stock options.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on employer. The employer adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. An employer adapted implicit query may show results similar to those for other searches run by employees of the same employer on the same day or in recent days. An employer adapted disambiguation facility may resolve ambiguities as to the query or results based on the status of the employer and an employer adapted search function may retrieve sort present or route results based on employer characteristics such as obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics . For example a user whose employer is the United States Patent Office might receive information on processing patents in response to a query on application while a Microsoft employee might receive information on software applications in response to the same query.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on annual income. The annual income adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search.

For example a heavy on line user entering blog may be sent to the day s most popular blogs while a light user might be presented with more general results describing the blogging phenomenon.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on duration of on line interactions. The duration adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example in an implicit query a user with a history of long interactions may be presented with a more complex or extensive result set while a user with a history of short interactions may be presented only with basic information. Similarly a disambiguation facility or a search function that retrieves sorts presents or routes results may do so based on duration of on line interactions. For example a user whose interactions are long may be presented with long articles scientific research or the like while a user with shorter duration interactions may be presented only with news headlines or the like. Similarly for example a short duration user entering football may receive a list of the day s scores while a long duration user may receive articles on football.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on number of on line interactions. The interaction adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example in an implicit query a user with a history of many interactions may be presented with more results while a user with few interactions may be presented only with the most pertinent results. Similarly a disambiguation facility or a search function that retrieves sorts presents or routes results may do so based on number or frequency of on line interactions such as indicated by a database of a wireless provider . For example a user whose interactions are many may be presented with long result sets while a user with fewer interactions may be presented only with the most relevant results. Similarly for example a frequent user entering Peter may receive only information relating to uses of that name in the day s news while a less frequent visitor might receive more general results ranging from Peter the Great to Pete Townsend to Peter Rabbit.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on family status and family information. The family information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example an implicit search may present results about dating or relationships to a single user while a married user may receive results relating to child rearing. Similarly a disambiguation process or a search function that retrieves sorts presents or routes results may use family status and family information. For example a single user entering love may receive results relating to dating and relationships while a married user might receive information relating to anniversaries.

A click stream adapted search function may run implicit queries based on past behavior such as running queries for new cars if the user has recently viewed cars with the mobile communications facility . Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results returned sorted presented or routed based on click stream information. For example a user entering a partial URL into a query facility may be directed to a recently visited web site while another user would be directed to a process for resolving ambiguity. Click stream information may be used to infer a wide range of behaviors and characteristics. Thus the other embodiments described herein may take place in combination with deriving one or more mobile subscriber characteristics from click stream information. For example if click stream information shows that a user has visited twenty female oriented sites then the information can be used to infer the gender of the user after which various embodiments of gender adapted search function described herein are enabled.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on device type. The device type adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example implicit queries may be run to retrieve results that are suitable for the type of device and filter out other results. For example if a mobile communications facility does not have a video rendering capability then video related results can be filtered out of the process. Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results retrieved sorted presented or routed based on device type. For example a user may be presented with results of walled garden content that is consistent with a device. Upon entering a query a user may receive results that are filtered to include content items that are viewable downloadable for the device and to exclude other content. Device type which may be obtained from the database of mobile subscriber characteristics may also be used to infer other items. For example a particular device may be most popular with a particular age or gender of users in which case the results can be adapted in a manner similar to that described in connection with the age adapted search function described herein.

For example implicit queries may be run to retrieve results that are suitable for the particular characteristics of a version of a device and filter out other results. For example if a mobile communications facility does not have a photo imaging capability then photo related results can be filtered out of the process. Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results retrieved sorted presented or routed based on device characteristics. For example a user may be presented with results of walled garden content that is consistent with the correct characteristics of a device. Upon entering a query a user may receive results that are filtered to include content items that are viewable and or downloadable for the characteristics of the device and to exclude other content. For example a user with a device that plays .mp3 files may receive music files upon entering a query for bruce while a user without music capabilities may receive web search results related to Bruce Springsteen. Device characteristics which may be obtained from the database of mobile subscriber characteristics may also be used to infer other items. For example particular device characteristics may be most popular with a particular age of user or gender in which case the results can be adapted in a manner similar to that described in connection with the age adapted search function described herein.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on usage patterns including those based on location time of day or other variables . The usage pattern adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example if a user frequently searches for restaurants on weekends then an implicit query may run restaurant searches on weekends. Similarly the same query e.g. rest may return restaurant related results on weekends while revealing results related to restructured text during work hours particularly if the usage pattern indicates that the user is a software engineer . Thus a disambiguation process or a search function to retrieve sort present or route results may use usage patterns to accomplish those functions. Usage patterns may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a wireless provider . A wide range of usage patterns may be used to assist with formation of queries implicit and explicit and with retrieval and organization of results. The algorithm facility may include one or more modules or engines suitable for analyzing usage patterns to assist with such functions. For example an algorithm facility may analyze usage patterns based on time of day day of week day of month day of year work day patterns holiday patterns time of hour patterns surrounding transactions patterns surrounding incoming and outgoing phone calls patterns of clicks and clickthroughs patterns of communications e.g. Internet email and chat and any other patterns that can be discerned from data that is collected by a wireless provider or Internet service provider. Usage patterns may be analyzed using various predictive algorithms such as regression techniques least squares and the like neural net algorithms learning engines random walks Monte Carlo simulations and others. For example a usage pattern may indicate that a user has made many work related phone calls during a holiday such as by determining that the user was located at work and making calls all day . Such a user may be presented preferably with content that is related to a vacation such as showing hotels rental cars or flight promotions in an implicit query or preferentially presenting such items in response to explicit queries including disambiguating partial queries or ambiguous queries . For example such a user might receive hotel information in response to entering the partial query hot while another user receives weather information. In one such embodiment the search function is adapted based on phone usage. The phone usage adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on device and or subscriber unique identifiers. The identifier adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Here as with usage pattern adapted search functions the identifier may be used to identify the user in the search facility allowing targeted queries disambiguation and results.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on content viewing history. The viewing history adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Viewing history may be obtained by a local facility on the mobile communication facility such as a database or cache on a cellular phone or it may be obtained at a central facility such as an Internet server or a central office for phone services. Such data may be retrieved for example from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics . Viewing history may be analyzed in embodiments by an algorithm facility such as to infer behavior based on content viewing patterns. In embodiments viewing history may include content viewed using a mobile communication facility . In other embodiments viewing history may include history with respect to other content provided by the same entity that is the wireless provider . For example such a provider may provide television content via DSL or cable Internet content to a home or other content. Viewing histories for all such content may be analyzed to assist with improving search function including assisting with development of implicit queries resolving ambiguities with explicit queries and retrieving sorting filtering presenting and routing search results. For example if a database of mobile subscriber characteristics shows that a particular viewer watched the first six episodes of 24 but missed the seventh episode then a search for the element 24 may retrieve online sources for the seventh episode while another user entering a similar query might receive general information about the show or information about 24 hour fitness centers. Viewing history should be understood to encompass all types of interactions with content such as downloading listening clicking through sampling or the like including all types of content such as text data music audio sound files video broadcast content and the like.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on content presented for viewed by not viewed by user. The declined content adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Information about declined content may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a wireless provider which may also be a provider of various other content sources that have been presented and declined such as by explicitly declining an option to view content or by implicitly declining ignoring the content such as upon repeated opportunities to view it . Wireless providers frequently have access to such viewing histories because the same carriers also provide television Internet and other content sources. Declined content can be analyzed with an algorithm facility to assist with forming implicit queries resolving explicit queries and with retrieving sorting filtering presenting and routing results. For example if a user has consistently declined or failed to view music oriented programming content whether on a cellular phone TV or Internet then a query for the term U2 might return information on Soviet era spy planes notwithstanding that for other users such a query would return content related to the rock group U2. As in analysis of usage patterns a wide range of algorithms including learning algorithms regression analyses neural nets and the like may be used to understand patterns in declined content that assist with handling queries and results.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on content and programs downloaded. The download history adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Downloaded content and programs may be determined from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as based on cellular phone usage television viewing Internet usage email usage or the like. Such content and programs may be analyzed and used in the manner described above for usage pattern adapted search functions . In one such embodiment the search function is adapted based on videos music and audio listened to and or downloaded. Again the content action adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. In another such embodiment the search function is adapted based on television watched. The television viewing adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. In another such embodiment the search function is adapted based on television subscriptions. The subscription adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. In one such embodiment the search function is adapted based on timing and duration of viewing downloading. The view download timing and duration adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search.

In embodiments the search facility may be a high volume scalable redundant search engine specifically tuned for mobile content. The engine may be implemented in Java and deployed in a two tier architecture in which the presentation logic runs on web servers which format the results returned by passing the actual search requests off to search servers. Search servers may use proprietary algorithms that blend results from full text metadata indices with results from 3rd party partner APIs. The search engine may be accessed via a query API. A query is a set of words possibly restricted to specific fields coupled with restrictions on content type category and format.

In embodiments the search facility may use a ranking algorithm which incorporates a number of features including one or more of full text relevance using e.g. term frequency inverse document frequency or TFIDF or variants and enhancements thereto word order and proximity scores number of words matching scores with thresholds popularity overall and within demographic editorial boosts and field by field boosts. The wireless provider may control the editorial boosts.

In an aspect of the invention mobile content may be reviewed to generate a relevance that can be used to determine if the content should be presented to a mobile communication facility . The relevance may alternatively be used to determine if at least some portion of content presented to the mobile communication facility should be presented to the user of a mobile communication facility . Mobile content may relate to one or more of blogs sports gambling social networking travel news community education product service government and the like. In an example mobile content that relates to gambling may be prevented from being presented to a mobile communication facility that is being used by a government employee.

The review of mobile content may be an algorithmic review. The algorithmic review may include a review of inbound links to the mobile content outbound links from the mobile content text of the mobile content keywords of the mobile content a link structure of the mobile content metadata associated with the mobile content and other aspects of mobile content that may be herein described.

Outbound links in the mobile content may be reviewed to determine a relevance as part of an algorithmic review. Outbound links may link to mobile content that has been blacklisted whitelisted or not yet reviewed. An outbound link to blacklisted content may be edited such that the link presented to the mobile communication facility is disabled. Alternatively the link may not be presented to the mobile communication facility . If an outbound link is to whitelisted mobile content it may be included in content presented to the mobile communication facility . A review of mobile content with outbound links to blacklisted content may result in the reviewed mobile content to be blacklisted.

If an outbound link of reviewed mobile content points to mobile content that has not yet been reviewed the outbound link may be followed such that the linked content may be reviewed. If the linked content is determined to be inappropriate or blacklisted then the mobile content containing the outbound link may be blacklisted.

Text in the mobile content may be reviewed to determine relevance as part of an algorithmic review. Text may be parsed and compared to a list of words and phrases to determine relevance. Text may also be processed using language processing techniques such as those employed by Microsoft Natural Language Processor to derive a context of the text. The derived context may be compared to known contexts to determine relevance. A variety of known search algorithms may be applied in an algorithmic review of mobile content text to determine relevance of the text. Techniques such as word stubbing word aliasing misspelling variants and the like may also be applied to an algorithmic review of mobile content text.

Mobile content keywords or metadata may be reviewed to determine relevance as part of an algorithmic review. Keywords and or metadata may represent critical aspects of the content because they may be visible to search engines and web crawlers. As an example a website that contains one or more keywords associated with radical political activism may be detected by an algorithmic review seeking these keywords. The website may be blacklisted whitelisted or assigned a relevance score based on these keyword matches.

A relevance as generated from a review of mobile content may be represented by a score such as a number within a range. The range of relevance scores may extend from whitelisted content to blacklisted content with the relevance score indicating the degree to which the mobile content contains aspects that prevent it from being whitelisted. Blacklisted mobile content may be prevented from being presented to the mobile communication facility . Whitelisted mobile content may be allowed to be fully presented to the mobile communication facility .

A relevance score may be a composite of a review of one or more aspects of the mobile content. For example each aspect may be reviewed and assigned a value such as 0 for a whitelisted aspect and 1 for a blacklisted aspect. In an example with 10 aspects of a website reviewed a first mobile content with a relevance score of 2 may indicate mobile content with few aspects that may not be whitelisted while a second mobile content with a relevance score of 8 may indicate mobile content that has a high percentage of blacklisted aspects. A user may identify a maximum relevance score associated with mobile content to be presented to the mobile communication facility . In this example if a user set a maximum relevance score for presentation of mobile content to 4 the first mobile content would be presented while the second mobile content would not be presented. Additionally the user may indicate a maximum relevance score associated with content to be whitelisted for presentation to the mobile communication facility . If the user sets a maximum relevance score for whitelisting to 2 then the first mobile content would be whitelisted. However if the user set the maximum relevance score for whitelisting to 1 both the first and the second mobile content would not be whitelisted.

A user of a mobile communication facility may identify a policy or preference associated with determining which mobile content may be presented to a mobile communication facility . A wireless provider may apply this personal policy or preference when reviewing mobile content for presentation to the user s mobile communication facility . As an example a personal policy or preference may identify foreign language mobile content to be excluded from search results to be presented to the mobile communication facility .

A wireless provider may have a content policy that determines appropriateness for mobile content to be presented to mobile communication facilities . The content policy may allow a user of a mobile communication facility to select one or more aspects of appropriateness to be applied to mobile content presented to the user s mobile communication facility . As an example a user may select an aspect of appropriateness associated with adult matter. In the example mobile content with adult matter would be prevented from being presented to the mobile communication facility . Therefore content that is determined to be inappropriate may not be presented to the mobile communication facility through the wireless provider .

Editorial review of mobile content may be combined with algorithmic review. Editorial review may identify aspects of mobile content such as links images video audio and other aspects. Mobile content may be presented to a mobile communication facility based on a relevance that is determined by a combined algorithmic and editorial review. Editorial review of mobile content may be performed by the wireless provider or some other entity. Editorial review may also include substitutions that may improve the usefulness of a mobile communication facility . In an example links to websites with relevant content that is not appropriate for presentation to a particular mobile communication facility due to its display characteristics may be replaced by links to websites with relevant content that are appropriate for presentation to the mobile communication facility .

In embodiments the search facility may be optimized for mobile input methods by using for example partial word matching suggestions and mobile communication facility compatibility. Partial word matching coupled with popularity scoring may provide the best possible results for the user. Partial word matching may also work for multiple word phrases. Thus a search for ro st may suggest results matching Rolling Stones . A suggestion is a recommended search string. For example for the query string piz a suggestion could be pizza . Suggestions may permit users to enter the wanted search terms with the fewest number of characters. Suggestions may be provided by the engine and cached locally for performance enhancement.

In embodiments the mobile communication facility may customize the search engine results to the capabilities of the mobile communication facility . For example the search engine may not present search results that are inappropriate for the device e.g. a ringtone that is incompatible . When compatibility information cannot be determined results that require particular hardware or software may receive lower rankings or scores. The recommendation engine may also or instead use the device type as one of the attributes when calculating recommendations.

In embodiments content may be segregated such that the search facility may take contextual queues based on where the user enters the search experience. For example users entering search from the ringtone area may receive ringtone restricted results. In addition the wireless provider may have multiple content partners and may wish to restrict the search to certain content partners in certain situations. For example the wireless provider may wish to provide a search box in an entertainment section which only searches content from a specific partner where a search box in the travel section would search different content. The search facility may limit results to a specific partner or set of partners.

The mobile content may from the perspective of the wireless search platform originate from a webpage. In this disclosure the term webpage should be interpreted as broadly as possible to include all instances formats types and variants of data. Thus a webpage may for example and without limitation comprise an HTML or DHTML file a result provided to a computing device by a Web service such as via SOAP or RPC XML information received via an RSS feed data received via an e mail protocol such as IMAP POP3 or SMTP content received via a peer to peer information sharing facility an SMS message a table in a relational database or an entry therein any information that may be received by produced by presented by and or adapted to be presented by the mobile communications facility and so forth. A webpage identifier may identify the webpage. For example and without limitation this identifier may be a name a URL a URI a DOI a permalink a message identifier a unique identifier a globally unique identifier a temporary identifier a persistent identifier and the like.

The first step in the method for indexing mobile content may comprise finding a webpage that contains the content. The finding process may be performed once periodically from time to time in response to a manual input automatically and so forth. In embodiments an instance of the additional or remote server may provide the finding process and or the webpage. Generally any computing facility associated with the wireless search platform may provide the finding process and or the webpage. In cases where the finding process involves a manual input the provider of the finding process may both have a human user and provide a user interface to the user wherein this user provides the manual input via this user interface. A concrete and tangible end result of finding the webpage may be receiving one or more webpage identifiers at the provider of the finding process.

In embodiments the finding process may comprise spidering. An autonomous agent or software agent may provide the spidering. This agent may be a web crawler a web spider an ant and the like. For example spidering may begin with the agent retrieving a webpage at a known URL. That webpage may contain hyperlinks or reference to other webpages. Spidering may continue with the agent retrieving the other webpages which may also contain hyperlinks or references to other webpages. Spidering may continue with the agent retrieving those webpages may likewise be processed by the agent. Many other examples and embodiments of spidering will be appreciated from this disclosure and such examples and embodiments are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.

In embodiments the finding process may include processing gateway data e.g. WAP gateway data mobile server gateway data server gateway data and or wireless provider gateway data . Gateway data may be associated with a WAP gateway or other such facility the wireless communication facility the additional or remote server or any other server or facility associated with the wireless search platform . The gateway data may include any message that is communicated between the mobile communication facility and a facility server or data source wherein during the communication the message is converted between a WAP data format and an HTTP data format for example. The gateway data may also include any data associated with a WAP gateway. Such data may without limitation be associated with a configuration an uptime a capability a network a protocol the wireless provider the wireless communication facility the mobile communication facility the mobile search host facility the additional or remote server and so forth. It should be appreciated that some or all of the information that is received or transmitted by the finding process may be the WAP gateway data. Thus finding the webpage that contains the content may be achieved by processing the WAP gateway data.

In embodiments the finding process may comprise self submission. A provider of the webpage may submit an identifier of the webpage to the provider of the finding process. This self submission may involve a manual input with the user of the webpage provider entering a webpage identifier for the webpage into the provider s user interface. Alternatively the self submission may be automatic with the webpage provider automatically submitting the webpage identifier to the provider of the finding process. Additionally or alternatively the provider of the webpage may submit a set of identifiers. For example the set may comprise a site map which may include identifiers of a plurality of webpages associated with a Web site. The provider of the webpage may provide any of these webpages. The set of identifiers may be represented in a flat arrangement a hierarchical arrangement a relational arrangement an object relational arrangement or any other arrangement.

In embodiments a user of the wireless search platform may enter a query into a mobile communication facility . As the user is entering this query a method of the wireless search platform processes the portion of the query that the mobile communication facility has received. This processing may take into account a context that is associated with the query. Based upon this processing the wireless search platform creates an ordered list of expected search queries that may be associated with a search vertical. The ordered list may be ordered based at least in part on a factor such as an information relating to a mobile communication facility a user characteristic a user history a user transaction a geographic location a user device a time and or a mobile communication facility characteristic. The ordering based on a factor may be performed based at least in part on a relevancy e.g. a relevancy score or some other value that may be used to express the association between a mobile content and a factor. The ordered list may be used as a suggestion dictionary in order to present suggested search queries to a user of a mobile communication facility.

For example a user located in Boston in the evening may wish to locate a French restaurant. The user may enter the search vertical Restaurants on a mobile communication facility and type French into the search box associated with this search vertical. The wireless search platform may use factors associated with the mobile communication facility in order to determine which of the possible suggestions that are located in the suggestion dictionary may be appropriate for this user s search query. These factors may include Time 8 pm Location Boston The suggestion dictionary may have relevancy scores assigned to mobile content within the search vertical Restaurants based at least in part on the relevance of each to Time and Boston. A restaurant located in Boston may be assigned a high relevance. A restaurant located in Missouri may be assigned a low relevance. Similarly a restaurant that is open for business at 8 pm may be assigned a high relevance whereas a restaurant not serving customers at 8 pm may be assigned a low relevance. Relevancy scores may also be combined in order to determine a cumulative relevance which takes into account a plurality of factors associated with the mobile communication facility and the pluralities association with a mobile content. Continuing the previous example the ordered list of content for presentation to the user that is derived from the suggestion dictionary may rank the following restaurants in descending cumulative relevance to the user i a restaurant in Boston that is open at 8 pm a restaurant in Boston not open at 8 pm. The platform may either omit entirely restaurants that are not in Boston and hence of minimal relevance to the user or present them very low in the hierarchy of presented search results. Many other examples and embodiments of the method and system of presenting an ordered list of suggested search queries will be appreciated from this disclosure and such examples and embodiments are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.

Information regarding the current location of a mobile communication facility may be used by a mobile search application for receiving search results that include mobile content relating to that location. As the mobile communication facility enters a second location the mobile search results may be updated based at least in part on the second location information and used to present search results relating to the second location. In embodiments a mobile search application may include tracking a mobile communication facility presenting search results based at least in part on a first location and presenting updated search results based at least in part on a second location.

Mobile content may be a sponsored content a sponsored link a sponsored call a downloadable content an audio stream a video or a graphic element. The search request may be initiated by a mobile communication facility including a phone mobile phone cellular phone and or a GSM phone.

In embodiments the location of the mobile communication facility may be determined according to a unique identifier associated with the mobile communication facility . A unique identifier may include but is not limited to a phone number an area code of a phone number a billing address and or a postal zip code of a billing address.

In embodiments the location of the mobile communication facility may be determined according to the location coordinates of a particular mobile communication facility . The location coordinates may be determined through GPS triangulation and or WiFi triangulation. The location may also be determined by a user entered location or a plurality of locations such as geographic regions including one or more states or one or more cities.

In embodiments the location of the mobile communication facility may be determined by a distance from a specified location.

For example a user of a mobile communication facility may initiate a text search query titled restaurant from a first location. The wireless provider wireless operator and or telecommunications provider may locate the mobile communication facility based upon information relating to the user s mobile communication facility . The user s home address may be on Hanover St. in Boston Mass. A GPS location triangulation and or WiFi triangulation may indicate that the user is currently in the vicinity of Hanover St. in Boston Mass. The user may be located a specific distance from cell towers located in Boston that are congruent with the user being in the vicinity of Hanover St. in Boston Mass. Alternatively the user may self enter his current location as being Hanover St. Using this location information the search results that pertain to restaurants that are on or near Hanover St. in Boston Mass. may be presented exclusively or in priority to other restaurants that are distant from Hanover St. Continuing this example later in the evening the user has now moved to a second location and would like to find a restaurant for dinner Again a text entry of restaurant is entered into the query entry facility of the mobile communication facility . Using one or all of the same means of determining the location of the mobile communication facility described above the search results may now display information regarding restaurants that are in the vicinity of the user s second location.

In embodiments a mobile search application disclosed herein may include receiving a location of a mobile communication facility and presenting search results to the mobile communication facility based on a predicted future location. The location of the mobile communication facility may be determined by a predicted future location that is based at least in part on a relationship of prior locations. The relationship of the locations may be used to predict a travel trajectory. The travel trajectory may be coupled with information regarding time. The timing of the residence in the future locations and their relationships may be used to predict a travel speed that is in turn used to predict a time of arrival at a predicted future location. The predicted time of arrival at a predicted future location may be used to pre load mobile content to a cache of the mobile communication facility for display upon arrival at the future predicted location or its vicinity.

In embodiments the location of the mobile communication facility may be determined based at least in part on as association with a route. A route may be a street highway railroad track subway track bus route flight path recreational course and the like. A route may be established by repetition and associated with a user of a mobile communication facility. Such a repeated route may include but is not limited to a commute to a workplace a commute form a workplace to a client s workplace a commute to a friend s residence a commute to a family member s residence a commute to a place of business e.g. a grocery store and the like.

For example a person traveling on an interstate highway may wish to find a restaurant at an upcoming exit. A wireless platform may be able to record the location of a mobile communication facility using any of the methods described above at time intervals to establish a travel line or trajectory that the user of the mobile communication facility is currently on. This trajectory may be compared to known routes such as those described above. Here the route of the user may match an interstate highway route. This information may be used to predict the future locations of the mobile communication facility. Because the location is taken at a time interval this information may be combined with the distance traveled between locations in order to predict a speed of travel. The predicted speed coupled with the predicted future location may enable the search results for restaurant entered by the interstate traveler to present exclusively or in priority those restaurants that are along the route on which the user is traveling. Because the direction of travel is also known those restaurants that may be close to the traveler in terms of distance but whose exit the traveler has already passed may be excluded or given a lower priority due to the greater difficultly involved in returning to them rather than simply visiting a restaurant located at an upcoming exit.

In embodiments the predicted time of arrival at a predicted future location may be used to pre load mobile content to a cache of the mobile communication facility for display upon arrival at the future predicted location or its vicinity.

The ordering of the generated search queries may be based at least in part on information relating to the mobile communication facility .

All such permutations and combinations are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

It will also be appreciated that means for performing the steps associated with the processes described above may include any of the hardware and or software described above. In another aspect each process including individual process steps described above and combinations thereof may be embodied in computer executable code that when executing on one or more computing devices performs the steps thereof.

In embodiments results may be presented to the mobile communication facility as they are retrieved without waiting for the entire result set to be retrieved. In embodiments certain results may be presented and displayed while other results are in the process of being presented or displayed This background processing of results may increase the speed at which some results can be presented to a mobile communication facility . In embodiments certain categories of results may be presented to the mobile communication facility before other categories. For example images may take longer to download process and or collect as compared to ringtones so the category of ringtones or individual ringtones may be presented to the mobile communication facility before or while the image results or image category is being locally loaded for presentation.

As described in connection with the mobile search host facility may include an algorithm facility personal filter e.g. a collaborative filter or personal filter . The personal filter may be used in conjunction with a search query entered and transmitted from the mobile communication facility along with information from one of the associated databases and or its location information. The personal filter may use an algorithm that predicts the desired results based on information collected from other searchers e.g. collaborative filtering as well information relating to the user e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information from database or location information .

An implicit search scenario associated with the illustration of could be as follows. The person is walking down the street at 7 00 p.m. The location of the mobile communication facility is assessed using a GPS system i.e. in association with the location facility . The location is then stored. An implicit search is initiated either because it is the time of day for the periodic implicit search because user habits indicate the user is going to be looking for results soon because there are advertisers interested in pushing an advertisement there is a local sale there is an activity nearby or there are other temporal activity based or other reasons to initiate the implicit search. Once the search is initiated the stored location information may be transmitted to a mobile search host facility. The mobile host search facility may also collect information from other associated sources e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor information database carrier rules . The mobile search host facility is now prepared to perform a search based on the personal filter in the mobile search host facility in conjunction with the user s location time of day and or other information relating to the several data sources available to the mobile search host facility e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor data base the content the carrier rules and the open web content . All of the information may indicate that this is the general time when the user eats dinner so the mobile search host facility may provide results to the mobile communication facility that pertain to dinner. In these results a sponsor may have participated in a search marketing auction in an attempt to get his information onto the user s mobile communication facility . For example a restaurant located in a building C may be the high bidder on a keyword auction related to dinners within five miles of another building C where the user is located so the information the restaurant wanted sponsored and displayed on the mobile communication facility will be displayed if the user interacts with the restaurant information presented. The information may not be presented until the user decides to look at search results which may not ever happen. If the user does not interact with the sponsored result that was downloaded to the mobile communication facility the sponsor may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider for the sponsored content. If the user does interact with the restaurant information that was downloaded on the mobile communication facility the restaurant may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider .

To continue with this implicit search scenario the user may enter into a results mode or search mode on the mobile communication facility . In a results mode results may appear without the need for a search. In this mode the user may simply be presented with information that he may be interested in given all of the prior information that is known about him e.g. location time of day and mobile subscriber information . In a search mode the user may enter a search query and if there is a relationship between the search query and the previously downloaded results the previously downloaded results may be presented. The user may perceive this as a very fast search or a high bandwidth connection because the search results are presented from local memory.

The previously downloaded results presented may include a sponsored link from the restaurant and the user may activate the sponsored link e.g. by clicking on it . Once activated or clicked or interacted with the user may be presented with information relating to the restaurant. The information may include contact information e.g. phone address email URL as well as a description of the restaurant. The user may be presented with a general section of the restaurant s website or a space tailored for the user . For example the restaurant may present users with a coupon or other sale if they arrive at the restaurant within a predetermined time. Knowing they are in the area and knowing the volume of restaurant traffic the restaurant may be able to offer a more targeted sale offer.

Likewise the bookstore in a building B may want to advertise to the user because he is in the area and has some history of searching amazon.com and the like. The restaurant may have signed up to participate in an auction for mobile communication facility advertising space relating to people in the area of the building B within the hours the store is open where the people have a history of activities related to the purchase of books e.g. searching amazon.com purchasing books on line or are frequent travelers .

While embodiments involving implicit searching have been described in connection with it will be appreciated that the same or similar techniques may be applied to explicit searches. For example the user may be in the area of an office building A and may be looking for the office building A. The user may enter a search query with the name of the office building B and the name of the office building may be combined with the user s location and time of day to better target search results for the user.

An explicit search scenario associated with the illustration of could be as follows. The person is walking down the street at 7 00 p.m. The location of the mobile communication facility is assessed using a GPS system i.e. in association with the location facility . The location is then stored. An explicit search is initiated by the user . Once the search is initiated the stored location information may be transmitted to a mobile search host facility. The mobile host search facility may also collect information from other associated sources e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor information database or carrier rules . The mobile search host facility is now prepared to perform a search based on the personal filter in the mobile search host facility in conjunction with the user s location time of day and other information relating to the several data sources available to the mobile search host facility e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor data base the content the carrier rules and the open web content . The search may be performed in conjunction with the personal filter and other relevant filtering information to obtain results. In these results a sponsor may have participated in a search marketing auction in an attempt to get his information onto the user s mobile communication facility . For example the restaurant located in a building C may be the high bidder on a keyword auction related to dinners within five miles of the building C so the information the restaurant wanted sponsored and displayed on the mobile communication facility will be displayed if the user interacts with the restaurant information presented. If the user does not interact with the sponsored result that was downloaded to the mobile communication facility the sponsor may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider for the right to post. If the user does interact with the restaurant information that was downloaded on the mobile communication facility the restaurant may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider .

The downloaded results presented may include a sponsored link from the restaurant and the user may activate the sponsored link e.g. by clicking on it . Once activated or clicked or interacted with the link may present the user with information relating to the restaurant. The information may include contact information e.g. phone address email URL as well as a description of the restaurant. In one embodiment the information may include a form or active control such as a button for making reservations. The user may be presented with a general section of the restaurant s website or a space tailored for the user . For example the restaurant may present the user with a coupon or other sale if he or she arrives at the restaurant within a predetermined time. Knowing they are in the area and knowing the volume of restaurant traffic the restaurant may be able to offer a more targeted sale offer.

Likewise the bookstore in a building B may want to advertise to the user because he is in the area and has some history of searching amazon.com and the like. The restaurant may have signed up to participate in an auction for mobile communication facility advertising space relating to people in the area of the building B within the hours the store is open where the people have a history of activities related to the purchase of books e.g. searching amazon.com purchasing books on line is a frequent traveler .

In embodiments search results are presented to the user on the mobile communication facility that are targeted to the user based on information relating to the user the mobile communication facility the location and or other information as described herein in conjunction with a personal filter. In embodiments the information is also used to better target advertising and sponsored advertisements may be provided to the mobile communication facility through a pay for auction advertisement scheme. Such a scheme could be similar to the desktop featured Google AdWords and AdSense by Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif.

By way of another example made in connection with the user may receive a search result that includes a pay per call link where the vendor associated with the call typically the company being called pays a fee when receiving a call through the pay per call number. For example the user may search for results related to flowers and receive back a phone number and possibly other contact information for the flower shop in building D. The link may have been provided as a result of processing a search through a process involving a personal filter in conjunction with information relating to the user the mobile communication facility and or the mobile subscriber characteristic information as indicated in the implicit search example and the explicit search example illustrated in connection with . Once the user activates the phone number for the flower shop the flower shop may be able to receive the call for a fee or reject the call.

A wireless search platform may use the keywords from a mobile communication facility search query and information stored in the wireless search platform to display user relevant sponsored mobile content on the mobile communication facility. Information stored in the wireless search platform may include personal user information user patterns of behavior with the mobile communications facility characteristics of the mobile communications facility and the like. Access to such user information in combination with the keyword content of the search query may increase the relevance of mobile content delivery to users and increase the probability of user interaction with the sponsored mobile content. The sponsored mobile content may be displayed on the mobile communication facility with a phone number to enable the user to place a call to the number in order to learn more about the displayed content make a purchase or carry out some other call based activity. User interaction may then be tracked and service providers may then charge the sponsors of the mobile content and or the users of the service as a source of revenue on a per interaction basis.

Sponsored mobile content may be an advertisement or some other form of sponsored content. Advertisements may relate to services provided by the sponsors of the wireless search platform such as new cell phone models additional services accessories and the like or consumer products such as electronics household items cars beauty aids and the like or for other purchases such as real estate college tuition time shares vacations and the like. Other forms of sponsored content may be political advertisements religious messages community programs and the like. Sponsored content may be associated with a bid process. The wireless search platform may use information gathered about the user along with keywords in the search query to determine what mobile content would be most relevant to the user.

Relevance to the user may be based at least in part on the keywords in the search query. Examples of relevance to keywords may be a search query for a car show resulting in an advertisement for a car or a search query for treatment of sun burn resulting in an advertisement for sun tan lotions or a search query for information for ski conditions resulting in an advertisement for time share condominiums in the mountains or a search query for election results resulting in a sponsored content for a political party and the like.

In embodiments relevance to the user may be based at least in part on the information relating to the mobile communication facility including user characteristics such as age sex race religion area code zip code home address work address billing address credit information family information income information birth date birthplace employer job title length of employment and alike user history such as past interactions with mobile content web sites visited phone usage types and alike user transactions for purchases and services geographic location time of day and time of usage mobile communication facility characteristics such as display capability video capability cache size storage capability memory capacity and alike or other such information. Examples of relevance to information relating to the mobile communication facility may include a search query for a car show resulting in an advertisement for a sports car because personal information about the user indicates that a sports car may be more relevant to the user because the user is young and male with an income that could afford a sports car or a search query for treatment of arthritis resulting in an advertisement for an electric convertible bed because information about the user indicates that the user is elderly and the user has been also recently searching for sleeping aids and has been placing calls from hospitals or a search query about interior design resulting in sponsored content for a university program for interior design because information about the user indicates that the user is young female living at home and has recently been searching and visiting universities furthermore the relevant advertisement that is selected may be presented on a mobile communication facility in a higher resolution format because the user s mobile communication facility characteristics indicate that the user s mobile phone is newer model that can accept the higher resolution format of the advertisement.

When the user is persuaded to call the phone number provided by the mobile content the user may click on a hyperlink to make the call manually dial the number enter the number into the mobile communication facility using a voice command or use some other method to call the number provided. A hyper link may involve clicking a hyper linked phone number on the displayed content or a hyper linked image on the displayed content. The user may choose to store the displayed phone number for subsequent use or dial the phone number manually. When the user places the call the wireless search platform may then store and track the interaction for subsequent billing to the sponsoring agent. The sponsored mobile content may require the user to pay a fee for placing the call. Examples of user fee calls may be stock information fan club updates sports tips and alike. In the case of user fee calls the wireless search platform may directly bill the user s account as a part of the service provided to the sponsoring service.

Another example of a mobile pay per call interaction may be a user whose information stored in the mobile search platform shows they are 42 years old male married with three young children and owns a house. The user s mobile communication facility information shows that the user s device is older and only capable of processing lower resolution mobile content. In addition recent user activity shows search queries for toys. The user then inputs a new search query for tent rentals. The mobile search platform s database indicates that it is also summertime. Given this information the mobile search platform shows a high relevance for supplies to support an outside birthday party for young children. The mobile search platform than delivers an advertisement to the user s mobile communication facility for an inflatable water slide from a local party rental store. The advertisement is displayed in a lower resolution format to coincide with the user s device capabilities. A phone number is provided in the advertisement that the user may now store for later use click on to call immediately dial manually and so on. When the user places the call the mobile search platform tracks the interaction and directs charges to the party rental store for the user interaction with the displayed phone number.

Another example of a mobile pay per call interaction may be a user whose information stored in the mobile search platform shows they are 18 years old female and living at home. The user s mobile communication facility information shows that the user s device is new and capable of displaying video content. In addition recent user activity shows search queries calling for information about members of various rock bands and downloads of rock videos. The user then inputs a new search query for information about members of the Dave Matthew s Band. Given this information the mobile search platform shows a high relevance for advertisements for new music and concerts for rock bands. The mobile search platform then delivers an advertisement to the user s mobile communication facility for tickets to a local Dave Matthew s concert. The mobile content is delivered as a short music video with audio and text that highlights the concert s date and time and that tickets are still available. The mobile content indicates a hyperlink with a phone number to get more information about the purchase of concert tickets. The user may now store the mobile content for later retrieval or connect immediately for more information. When the user places the call the mobile search platform may track the interaction and directs charges to the agency selling the concert tickets for the user interaction with the displayed phone number. The mobile search platform may also direct charges to the user s mobile account as a service charge for purchasing the tickets using the mobile pay per call functionality.

In embodiments of the present invention methods and systems may include presenting a link in a user interface of a mobile communication device where the link is configured to link to a commercial item that is available via a computer network thus enabling a party to sponsor the link. The link may be to an item of goods or services for sale to a promotion to a content item to an advertisement or to other material of a commercial provider such as a vendor of goods or services. The link may for example be to an item on an electronic commerce site to an auction site to a reverse auction site to a news site to an information site or to other content on a computer network such as web content content located on other networks or the like. The link may include or be associated with various e commerce features such as those enabling single click purchasing bidding targeted advertising instant purchasing e.g. buy it now tracking of clicks or transactions tracking of referrals affiliate program features or the like. In embodiments the link is a sponsored link that is presented to a user on the user interface of a mobile communication facility such as a cell phone. The sponsored link may be presented in association with an implicit query and may be related to such a query . The sponsored link may be presented in response to entering an explicit query or partial entry of such a query . The sponsored link may be presented upon making of a telephone call or other action of a user of the mobile communication facility . The sponsored link may be presented upon retrieval of results sorting of results filtering of results presentation of results or routing of results such as in response to a search function that is executed in response to a query.

In embodiments the right to sponsor a link is obtained via a bidding process among a plurality of candidate sponsors. The bidding process may be automated whereby a bid or a reserve bid reserve price or the like is automatically compared to other bids made by other candidate sponsors for a link in an auction format. In other embodiments bids need only meet a required price in order to be accepted. An algorithm facility may determine what link or links relate to winning bids for sponsoring particular links. Bids can be for presenting links at a particular position in the user interface at a particular point in a navigation sequence such as on a home page on a search screen after a call has been made after a transaction has been executed after navigation to a particular screen upon presentation of an implicit query upon entry of an explicit query upon retrieval of results upon routing of results and or upon consummation of a transaction or the like . Bids can be made for associating a link with particular content such as particular forms of queries particular results or particular content items. For example a sponsor who sells golf equipment might bid to sponsor links whenever an implicit or explicit query uses the terms golf tee or par while a sponsor who sells video content might seek to sponsor links when a query uses the terms movie film cinema or show. In embodiments a bidding process may occur in close proximity in time to the presentation of the link.

In embodiments an advertisement may be presented to a mobile communication facility based at least in part on receiving a webpage request from the query facility of a mobile communication facility receiving information associated with the mobile communication facility and associating at least one advertisement with a webpage at least in part based on the information relating to the mobile communication facility. For example a user of a mobile communication facility may initiate a search query for Sonny Rollins. The potential search results that may be presented to the user s mobile communication facility may include advertisements and websites for CD s of Sonny Rollin s music videos of his performances etc. Information about the mobile communication facility e.g. its video streaming capabilities may be used in order to determine which of the advertisement webpage results may be presented successfully to the user s mobile communication facility. This information may in turn be used to pair webpages and advertisements that are each capable of presenting in the display of the user s mobile communication facility.

In certain embodiments the right to sponsor the link is obtained via an auction which may be an online auction.

In embodiments a link may be associated with a disambiguated version of a query so that a link appears only after the relevancy of a query has been assessed.

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with a result that is retrieved via a search that is executed using the mobile communication device . For example a link for a camera vendor may appear only when one of the highest ranked search results uses the words digital camera. 

In embodiments the sponsored link may be associated with the sorting of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example a link may be sponsored including after a bidding process only if associated results are ranked sufficiently high after they are sorted such as being sorted as a result of a ranking or disambiguation process .

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with the filtering of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example the sponsored link may only appear after certain types of results have been filtered out. For example a sponsor of travel to Paris France might bid to sponsor a link only in situations where results relating to Paris Hilton have been filtered out before results are presented to the user.

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with the presentation of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example if certain results are modified or filtered such as based on the capability of a particular device to present certain content a sponsored link may be sponsored only for situations where relevant results can be presented on the mobile communications facility. For example a sponsor may bid to sponsor links to instructional videos for yoga but only for presentation on devices that are capable of rendering sample video.

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with the routing of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example if an algorithm facility includes rules for routing certain types of results a sponsored link may be associated with the execution of such rules. For example rules related to parental controls may route content or messages to parents if children appear to be attempting to access inappropriate content. A sponsored link may allow a provider of parental control software or services to present a link that is associated with the routed results.

In embodiments a link may be provided to a commercial item of a party who has not yet sponsored the link. The party may then be offered the opportunity to sponsor the continued presentation of the link. In embodiments the offer to continue to sponsor the link may be presented to a commercial entity contemporaneously with or upon a user s execution of the link. In embodiments such an offer may include an invitation for the commercial entity to participate in an auction or bidding process for continued sponsorship of the link or for sponsorship of at least one additional link.

In embodiments the link to a commercial entity may include a phone number for a provider of the commercial item. In embodiments the phone number may be a dedicated phone number which when called by a user conveys an intermediate message to the commercial entity that includes an offer to continue the link in exchange for an agreement by the commercial entity to pay some consideration which may be a sponsored link basis an auction basis a pay per call basis or the like.

In embodiments a generalized process may be used for disambiguating a user query entry by pairing the query information with at least one element from the mobile subscriber characteristics database . Once the user submits a query entry via the mobile communication facility the query is wirelessly routed to the wireless communication facility and then to the wireless provider . The wireless provider may then abstract data stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database that is relevant to the user query entry . Relevance may be based upon semantic similarities temporal factors and geographic and or demographic congruence between the substance of the query entry and that found in the mobile subscriber characteristics database . Once this information is linked the disambiguation facility may carry out operations to elucidate the probable best meaning of the user s query entry and route the result s back through the wireless provider and wireless communication facility to the mobile communication facility for display to the user.

Representative elements that may be stored within the mobile subscriber characteristics database include location personal information relating to a user web interactions email interactions messaging interactions billing history payment history typical bill amount time of day duration of on line interactions number of on line interactions family status occupation transactions previous search queries entered history of locations phone number device identifier type of content previously downloaded content previously viewed and sites visited.

Similarly the query entry may be disambiguated based upon characteristics of the user s mobile communication facility e.g. unique phone number device identifier or other unique identifier information stored within the mobile communication facility e.g. information stored in the memory of the device or information stored on a database associated with a server.

In embodiments mobile search host facilities may be used for providing mobile communications facility users additional relevant result set s based upon a query entry . For example the mobile communication facility may have a cache of memory wherein salient information is stored such as aspects of the mobile communication facility the user s profile and a user behavioral history e.g. phone calls websites visited search queries frequency of queries frequency of downloading content rate changes in the frequency of events and frequency of purchases .

This information may be automatically refreshed and transferred at set temporal intervals from the mobile communication facility to the wireless communication facility and then on to either the user s wireless provider or directly to the mobile search host facilities . Within the mobile search host facilities the query content may be filtered by an algorithm facility that scrutinizes the query content for the purpose of providing the user additional suggestions in the result set s . For example the frequency of terms used by the user in the query entry may be used by the algorithm facility to suggest related results based upon similar frequency indexing of key words or upon the popularity of query terms and results. As the user amends his query entry the cache may implicitly transfer the content to the mobile search host facilities for real time processing within the disambiguation facility search facility or other facility within the mobile host search facilities .

Additional facilities within the mobile search host facilities may be used to add meaningfulness to the query entry . For example the disambiguation facility may categorize the query entry based upon key words word frequency and or word combinations thereby enabling the resulting categories such as title artist and yellow page type categories. Carrier business rules parental controls and a sponsorship facility may also be used to generate suggestions for these and related search query and or result set s .

An interactive process between the mobile communication facility and the disambiguation step may be used for unambiguous query formation . Once a user submits a query entry to the mobile communication facility a process of correction may be necessary or helpful for unambiguous query formation that is sufficient to yield intelligible and useful result set s . As part of the correction process information specific to the type of mobile communication facility may be used for example if the device has unique delivery capabilities the query may need correction in order to derive a result set compatible with these capabilities. Information stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database or parental controls facility may also be integral to the correction process. In embodiments the search engine may automatically suggest corrections for common misspellings including those which are unique to the mobile experience e.g. 2nite 

A user s query entry may return a null result set or an improbable results set. In this case the search facility in conjunction with the mobile communication facility could automatically trigger correction and iteratively cycle through alternative query entries until a non null or higher probability result set is delivered.

In embodiments items which have been more recently added or updated may receive a ranking priority indicative of their freshness.

In embodiments additional recommendations may be made following a user s query entry based upon the information related to the mobile communication facility . For example mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules or sponsor information in conjunction with the query entry may suggest relevant recommendations for the user. The recommendations may be paired with the query entry search results or presented prior to or following the display of the search results.

A user s prior search activities and search results may also be used to create recommendations for the user. Prior search activities may include transactions search queries visits to websites phone calls and or other acts initiated by the user on the mobile communication facility . The geographic location of the mobile communication facility may foster recommendations including but not limited to sponsor information e.g. products and services in the user s current geographic vicinity. The current time may be used independently or in conjunction with other information to create user recommendations. For example the independent fact that it is noon may create recommendations for restaurants serving lunch. This information may be further filtered by the location of the mobile communication facility to recommend only those restaurants that are in the user s immediate vicinity and it may be further filtered by the subscriber s characteristics to recommend only that subset of restaurants serving lunch in the user s current vicinity that have received high ratings by restaurant patrons with a demographic profile similar to the user s. As with the above restaurant example similar processes for generating meaningful recommendations may be applied to other services and products including transportation navigation taxis buses trains cars airports etc. food and drink groceries drive through restaurants bars etc. entertainment theater sports movies clubs etc. business corporations workplaces banks post offices and other mailing or shipping facilities. etc. consumer needs gas stations drug or clothing stores baby sitters parking etc. and information specific to the locale directions locations starting times news etc. 

In embodiments classifications of search categories may be presented that relate to the search query on a display associated with the mobile communication facility .

In embodiments a query entry may be mapped to a taxonomy of query categories and classification schema e.g. the yellow pages phone book taxonomy .

In embodiments results may be retrieved based on submitting a query entry in conjunction with information relating to the mobile communication facility . This information may include the mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules and sponsor information. The additional information stored in these databases may form search parameters that limit the search query and the display of result set s by omitting information prioritizing information e.g. presenting sponsor links prior to all others highlighting a subset of the search result set or ordering the display of information based upon a sponsor auction i.e. highest bidder presented first . In the case of the sponsor auction sponsors may bid on keywords that they would like to be associated with their products services and links thereto.

In embodiments results may be ordered in relation to the query entry based at least in part on information relating to the mobile communication facility . This information may include mobile subscriber characteristics a search algorithm facility parental controls carrier business rules and or sponsor information. Ordering results related to a query entry based on sponsor information may be done by associating sponsors with key words used in query entries and or associating query entries with sponsor content. When a query entry matches a sponsor s keyword s or content that sponsor s information may be prioritized in the search result display highlighted or otherwise given superiority over other content related to the query entry . Association of key words with sponsors may occur through an auction in which bidders compete for sole association with keywords or for a shared frequency of keyword association e.g. every other occurrence of a keyword . Furthermore the auction process could include bidding to determine the size of the resulting sponsor content display e.g. expressed as a percentage of the user s total display space on the mobile communication facility and the addition of multimedia content to the results display such as adding graphics audio or a video stream.

Query results may also be ordered at least in part based on the capabilities of the mobile communication facility wherein the capability is an audio visual processing or screen capability.

In embodiments a query entry may be made by producing predictive text based at least in part on information relating to the mobile communication facility such as mobile subscriber characteristics a search algorithm facility a personal filter parental controls carrier business rules or sponsorship information. Additionally predictive text may be based on the mobile communication facility s SMS conversion and or keypad sequence conversion. Additionally T9 errors may be corrected. For example if a user seeks Britney and dials 2748639. T9 may interpret that as Argumenw instead.

In embodiments a voice based query entry may be associated with information relating to the mobile communication facility such as voice interpretation based at least in part on SMS conversion.

In embodiments an auction may be associated with a query entry . Performing the auction may involve using information relating to the mobile communication facility for example mobile subscriber characteristics a search algorithm facility a personal filter parental controls or carrier business rules . The result set s display may prioritize or highlight sponsor results.

In embodiments a search query may be entered on a mobile communication facility and results presented on a screen associated with the mobile communication facility and a transaction may be performed in association with a sponsored link where the transaction may occur by the user clicking on a sponsored link or engaging in a commercial transaction such as purchasing downloadable content.

In embodiments aggregated content may be presented to the mobile communication facility . Content may be aggregated through a spider including for example ringtone content music content or video content. The spider may determine the compatibility of the content with the capabilities of the mobile communication facility . Compatibility may be determined by running a series of mock mobile communication facility trials and using the results to extract results from sites on a preferred basis. The preferred basis may provide for the extraction from a WAP compatible content site first or extraction from content type sites first where the content was aggregated in relation to information relating to the mobile communication facility .

In embodiments spiders may be used to determine the compatibility between content and the capabilities of mobile communication facilities. For example a spider may present to a content provider as a particular type of mobile communication facility in order to detect the level of compatibility between that type of mobile communication facility and the content offered by the content provider. Furthermore a content provider such as a mobile storefront may provide different content for each type or class of mobile communication facility. The spider may be able to present to the content provider and determine the associations between a given provider s content classes and types or classes of mobile communication facilities.

In embodiments spiders may be able to determine the compatibility of content with mobile communication facility types by detecting webpage content qualities that are specific to a type or class of mobile communication facility e.g. HTML tags color depth number of images size of images etc . Once the compatibility data is compiled by a spider the data may be stored in a database and used in conjunction with a search engine to optimize content presentation by sending only compatible content or the most compatible content available to the mobile communication facility from which the search query is sent.

Mobile content may require certain capabilities to be enabled on a mobile communication facility for proper presentation of the mobile content to the user. However at least some of the certain capabilities may not be available on all mobile communication facilities . Without proper presentation to the user mobile content may lack value or interest to the user. It may alternatively cause an inconvenience for the user such as a presentation error or may cause malfunction of the mobile communication facility . The malfunction may include improper actions in response to a user interacting with the mobile content through the mobile communication facility user interface. Such a malfunction may result in a variety of downstream issues for the user as the improper response may include changes in the mobile communication facility configuration interface or other aspects.

Aspects of mobile content may be analyzed with respect to compatibility with a mobile communication facility . Each aspect may also be ranked based on one or more measures of compatibility. As an example an aspect of mobile content may involve a rudimentary function of wireless communication. Such an aspect may be ranked based only on meeting a minimum degree of compatibility. In another example an aspect of mobile content that enables advanced capabilities if they are present in a mobile communication facility may be ranked only for mobile communication facilities that have the capabilities. Other aspects of the mobile content may be ranked for all mobile communication facilities .

Measures of mobile content compatibility may vary based on criteria such as mobile communication facility manufacturer or product line. For example an aspect of mobile content that is directed toward a specific manufacturer or product line or even model number such as a BIOS upgrade may be unranked for use on mobile communication facilities from other manufacturers.

A mobile content rank may include any and all rankings of aspects of the mobile content. The rankings of aspects of the content may be combined in a variety of ways including adding the rankings to generate a mobile content rank total. Each aspect may be weighted such that all aspects may not contribute equally to the total rank. A mobile content rank total may represent a single aspect rank.

Mobile content ranking may also provide an indication of the extent of compatibility based on a ranking range such as 1 to 10 . Alternatively ranking may provide a binary yes or no measure of compatibility. The ranking may be associated with a specific mobile communication facility model number such that a mobile content may have a plurality of rankings. In an example a model A of a mobile communication facility may support a subset of features present in a first mobile content while model B supports all of the features present. In comparison with other mobile content the first mobile content may be ranked higher than other mobile for model B while other mobile content may be ranked higher than the first mobile content for model A.

A wireless provider may use mobile content rankings for selecting mobile content to be provided to a mobile communication facility . Compatible mobile content may allow a user to interact with the content and thereby increase the chance of the user responding positively to the sponsored content. If the mobile content is not compatible or has poor compatibility the user may not be able to interact with the content at all. Therefore mobile content that has greater compatibility with a mobile communication facility may have greater value to the wireless provider because a content sponsor may pay a higher commission for delivering such content than for delivering content that has little or poor compatibility.

Mobile content may include features such as video and audio in a basic format that may be properly displayed on a wide variety of mobile communication facilities . However these features may also be adapted in mobile content such that mobile communication facilities with capabilities that support the adapted video may offer the user more satisfaction reduce time and frustration or simply enable viewing the video.

Analyzing mobile content may include examining the source of the mobile content such as the HTML source. Syntax and constructs of the source may reveal information about aspects of the mobile content that may be compared to features or aspects of a mobile communication facility . Such a comparison may yield an assessment of the compatibility of the mobile content with the mobile communication facility . For example links within the source of the mobile content that link to certain types of data files such as video audio and the like may indicate the need for certain capabilities in the mobile communication facility to properly present the mobile content. Syntax of the mobile content source may represent specific functions or commands to resources of a mobile communication facility . These commands and or the arguments included with the commands may be compared to a list of commands and or arguments supported by a mobile communication facility resulting in analysis of compatibility.

Links and other references to mobile content may also provide information regarding compatibility. While the music file format MP3 is a standard and an iPod supports MP3 formatted files music files provided on line by the vendor for the iPod are not fully compatible with the MP3 standard. This results in these files being incompatible with other vendor s mobile communication facilities that support MP3 files. By examining the links to determine a potential owner of the mobile content compatibility may be determined.

Links in mobile content may reference other portions of the mobile content and as such the link may not include a file type or owner. Therefore analyzing other aspects of the mobile content may provide a measure of compatibility. One such aspect is the size of the mobile content. A portion of the memory facility on a mobile communication facility may provide storage for mobile content. However the amount of mobile content that can be stored in a mobile communication facility may be limited. Therefore a measure of compatibility between mobile content and a mobile communication facility may be the size of the mobile content. Mobile content that supports streaming to the mobile communication facility for presentation to the user may overcome content storage limitations in mobile communication facilities with small content storage capacity.

Mobile content may include metadata that may describe or include properties of the mobile content. The metadata may include information such as size type of content audio video and the like specific features supported such as streaming and the like. Analysis of mobile content may be based at least in part on an examination of the metadata. The metadata may include rankings of compatibility with a variety of mobile communication facilities . The rankings may be generated by the owner of the content or by a third party such as a wireless provider .

Rankings of mobile content may be stored in one or more of the memory facilities of the mobile search platform . To ensure the rankings are up to date the mobile content may be analyzed from time to time and the rankings may be updated. This analysis may be automated by processing the content with a computer program adapted to analyze mobile content. The computer program may execute on a server as herein disclosed.

A mobile communication facility may receive a ranking for mobile content along with the mobile content such that the mobile communication facility may use the ranking to determine if the mobile content should be presented. The determination may be based at least in part on user preferences regarding presentation of ranked mobile content. The determination may also be based at least in part on a preference of the mobile content owner as it may be provided in the mobile content or the mobile content metadata. While a user may choose to allow the presentation of mobile content that has poor compatibility with an mobile communication facility the content owner may prefer that the content not be presented to the user rather than the content being poorly presented to the user. The mobile content presentation resources display resource audio resource and the like of the mobile communication facility as herein disclosed may evaluate any or all of the mobile content the rankings the metadata user preferences owner preferences and the like to make a determination of presentation.

In embodiments of the method and system the determination if a mobile communication facility is authorized to receive a type of mobile content may be based at least in part on information relating to a user of a mobile communication facility. For example a user of a mobile communication facility may enter the text query entry of gambling. Information relating to the mobile communication facility that may be stored in a mobile subscriber database may indicate that the user has an age of 30 years. Because this age exceeds that age of maturity the adult content related to gambling may be authorized to present to the user s mobile communication facility . Alternatively a user characteristic such as age may be used to set an authority information in advance of a user s request for adult content. For example in the previous example the user had an age in excess of the age of maturity. This information may permit a general authorization for this user to access adult content on the mobile communication facility that is associated with the user regardless of whether a search request for mobile content has been received. This authorization may be made by a wireless operator wireless provider telecommunications provider an individual e.g. a parent or any other party interested in determining the content that is authorized to present to a mobile communication facility.

In embodiments an authorization to view adult content may be used by an individual to set an authorization using a logged administrator s request. For example a parent may want to ensure that their child is not able presented adult content on a mobile communication facility . The parent may be able to serve as an administrator of the child s phone and log onto an authorization facility that may be maintained by a wireless operator wireless provider and or a telecommunications provider and the like. Once logged onto the authorization facility the parent may be presented with a menu of content types and set a unique authorization level for each content type. For example such a menu may include a taxonomy. Such a taxonomy may include but is not limited to a set of search verticals such as sports weather blogs gambling news pornography health food and so forth. Within such as taxonomy a parent may be able to select to authorize or not authorize the presentation of content from that search vertical or category to the child s mobile communication facility .

In embodiments an authorization facility may have key words that an administrator can accept or block from a search query entered into the query entry facility of the child s mobile communication facility . For example an administrator may block a query entry facility from accepting query entries that include keywords that are commonly associated with adult content such as gambling terms of art like team parlay or betting line explicit references common to pornography terms associated with lotteries such as power ball pick 3 and the like.

In embodiments an authorization facility may combine elements of a taxonomy based authorization with a keyword base authorization.

In embodiments pay per click and pay per call program integration onto mobile communication facilities may enable a wireless provider to deliver targeted keyword based ads and content to mobile users searching for specific goods and services at the precise moment a user expresses a need. Pay per click advertising often referred to as search engine marketing or keyword advertising operates on the principle of pay for performance through this channel advertisers may pay only for the clicks or web site visits they receive through their text based advertisement. Businesses may place their ads for specific search phrases or keywords that best describe their company or products. Advertisers generally use several different keywords for their ads trying to maximize the number of searches for which they will appear e.g. Sony may try to advertise for the search phrases DVD player Television Mobile phone etc. . Search engine marketing operates through a real time auction based pricing model in which advertisers bid to appear for their relevant keywords. The advertiser s position or rank in the paid listings is determined by the bid price with the top position going to the highest bidder. Given the wide range of popularity for keywords competition varies drastically for keywords bid prices for the most popular keywords are driven up as they attract more advertisers. Keyword competition may be driven by several factors including a product s average sale price customer acquisition cost and number of competitors. Advertisers may create their own ads through a self service or sales assisted web interface. Examples of web based pay per click products include Google AdWords Yahoo Search Marketing MIVA and Lycos InSite AdBuyer. When creating an ad the advertiser may supply information such as an ad title URL description and or website URL. Pay Per Call advertising combines search functionality with live on the phone interaction resulting in a powerful marketing opportunity for local businesses.

Pay per call advertising operates on the same principle as pay per click in that advertisers bid to appear in specific search results or directory categories and are charged only when a consumer who sees their ad places a call to the advertiser s listed phone number a system generated toll free number that redirects the user to the company s true number . An advertiser s position in the list of paid results is determined by the bid amount with the highest bid yielding the top position. Unlike traditional search advertising however Pay per call advertising may be able to tap into the uniquely high level of user intent by connecting qualified mobile consumers directly with businesses at the exact moment they are searching for specific goods and services. Pay per call listings may be presented above traditional directory or yellow pages results.

In embodiments third party pay per call inventory may be supplied to in the form of XML feeds each of which returns specific results data on a per query basis about the keyword match the advertiser and ad information bid price and geographic filter settings. This information may then be parsed and packaged in a result set stacked on top of natural yellow page listings. A yield optimization algorithm may be used to ensure that each query is answered with a relevant and monetizable set of paid content. The yield optimization algorithm considers several variables to determine placement and rank simultaneously including relevancy geography click through call through rate and bid price. Relevancy may be in part determined by the query string including keyword location and ultimately demographic behavioral factors that may be matched to information supplied in the advertisement and or the assigned business categories. For geography it may be possible to present only those businesses serving the respective geographical areas zip code city state as specified by the advertiser. The algorithm for the click through call through rate may also consider the frequency with which users actually place the call to the advertiser in determining best query match. Bid price refers to the placement and rank of a given advertisement as determined in part by the amount paid by the advertiser.

In embodiments advertisers may create and manage their mobile search pay per click advertising campaigns through a user interface that permits ad creation selection of keywords to associate with the ad s and or service area s in which to make the ad accessible and place a bid for the service. For example the advertiser may begin by entering the ad creative content including the ad title a Landing page URL address page to which user will be brought not displayed the Display URL address address to be displayed in ad and an ad description 1 2 lines for display in ad . The advertiser may then enter keywords search phrases for which the ad should appear. There may be several ways of entering the keywords including manual entry the advertiser may type copy the keywords manually use of a keyword suggestion tool thesaurus advertisers can view synonyms or related keywords along with estimated monthly search volume and top bids and or bulk upload advertisers may upload keywords in bulk when dealing with a high volume of keywords . Finally the advertiser may wish that the ad s target only a subset of users such as only users residing in a particular geographic region meeting a set of demographic user characteristics and or users with a particular mobile communication facility .

Once an advertiser has selected one or more of the above criteria the advertiser may then set a specific or maximum price that they are willing to pay for a click through to their web site. Bids may be for each keyword associated with a given ad or any other criterion or combination of criteria used by the advertiser to target the placement of their ad s . Bids may be placed individually by keyword or an advertiser can apply one bid price across all new keywords for the new ad. Advertisers will also be able to view the top bids for each keyword directly through the user interface in order to gauge keyword competition and to ensure their ad appears in the desired position. The bidding process may also include Auto Bid functionality that allows the platform to manage an advertiser s bids directly. For instance by specifying the desired position for the ad and a maximum amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for each click the advertiser may allow the system to monitor the competitive landscape and adjust the advertiser s bids to pay only the minimum that is required to secure the desired spot up to but not exceeding the specified maximum .

In embodiments advertisers may create and manage their mobile search pay per call advertising campaigns through a user interface that permits ad creation selection of details to associate with the ad s and or service area s in which to make the ad accessible and place a bid for the service. The advertiser may begin by entering the general contact information for the business including the business name mailing contact address phone number number where advertiser wishes to receive call ad may display system generated toll free number and or the ad description. The advertiser may also enter additional pieces of information and functionality pertaining to each ad including setting the daily callable hours schedule the advertiser may specify a time of day when it wants an ad to appear upload company logo to appear with ad enter coupon information e.g. the advertiser may set campaign specific discounts for users who reach a specific ad. The advertiser may then enter keywords search phrases in response to which the ad should appear. There may be several ways of entering the keywords including manual entry the advertiser may type copy the keywords manually use of a keyword suggestion tool thesaurus advertisers can view synonyms or related keywords along with estimated monthly search volume and top bids and or bulk upload advertisers may upload keywords in bulk when dealing with a high volume of keywords . The advertiser may choose that the ad s target only a subset of users such as users residing in a particular geographic region meeting a set of demographic user characteristics and or having particular types of a mobile communication facility . Advertisers may set the specific price they will be charged whenever they receive a call through the pay per call system. They may have the ability to view in real time competitors prices per category in order to ensure their ad appears in the desired position and to optimize their performance.

In embodiments keyword sales sponsored listings both pay per click and pay per call may go through an administrative and editorial review to ensure an ad pertains to the business and the categories selected by the advertiser and that the ad will be deemed appropriately relevant by a yield optimization algorithm.

In embodiments pay per click and pay per call advertisements may be priced as pay for performance in that the advertiser is charged only for those calls successfully placed through the mobile communication facility interface. It may be possible to configure the platform such that advertisers are not charged for repeat calls short calls e.g. a wrong number or other unintentional call and or hang ups or disconnections. In addition to flat per call charges some specific calls e.g. calls exceeding a given time threshold may be subject to overage fees.

A mobile content website may contain web pages including text. The text may be unrelated to navigation or activation links on the web page yet may provide valuable insight into the value and purpose of the website.

Sponsors of mobile content websites may be desirous of promoting their websites to mobile communication users. Mobile communication users may be desirous of learning about the mobile content website so they may use a mobile search service to help them identify websites in which they may be interested. A technique used by search services particularly those associated with websites is to match keywords input by a user to relevant terms associated with websites. Therefore a sponsor may prefer to have a method or system to analyze their mobile content website to identify relevant terms and perhaps rank the terms to identify the most popular or useful terms. A sponsor may further use the analysis system or method to improve website text such that relevant terms more closely match popular or useful keywords.

In embodiments a method or system may be used to analyze a mobile content website to identify keywords that represent relevant terms used on the mobile content website. As an example an automated system may process each page of the mobile content website counting terms in the text resulting in counts of each term on the website. Further processing through one or more filters for filtering out common terms such as prepositions may result in a count of unique relevant terms in the text. Further processing the words into groups such as those terms related to action links internal links external links and the like may result in an analysis of relevant terms of a mobile content website. The result may be summarized as a report and may be presented to the sponsor.

In embodiments a mobile content website may be periodically analyzed for changes in content for purposes of assessing the relevance of keywords previously generated. For example a sponsor may update a website to such an extent that the website content that was previously associated with keywords is no longer reliable i.e. the updated content and existing keywords no longer have high relevancy . When this occurs the system may send an alert to the sponsor indicating that the relevance of the keywords is reduced and may recommend revising the keywords being financed in the marketing program.

In embodiments a search query may be suggested by correcting the suggested search query based in part on information relating to a client device. Once a user receives a suggested query entry a process of correction may be necessary for unambiguous query formation that is sufficient to yield intelligible and useful result set s . As part of the correction process information specific to the type of mobile communication facility may be used for example if the device has unique delivery capabilities the suggested query may need correction in order to derive a result set compatible with these capabilities. Information stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database or parental controls facility may also be integral to the correction process.

It is possible that a suggested query returns a null result set or improbable results set. In this case the search facility in conjunction with the mobile communication facility could automatically trigger correction and iteratively cycle through alternative suggested queries until a non null or higher probability result set is delivered.

In embodiments additional recommendations may be made following a suggested query entry based upon the information related to the mobile communication facility .

In embodiments data feed files may be pushed by the wireless provider to a provided FTP location. This may trigger the feed processing. Data feed files may be pulled from a wireless provider supplied FTP location. This may be done on a predefined schedule.

In embodiments deck content may be used for indexing via spidering. Spidering is the process of traversing web pages WAP pages or other online content in an automated fashion and extracting relevant content. A spider may start at one or more root nodes and traverse the links from those pages following a set of rules. Spidering may occur on a predefined schedule and may be invoked manually when requested by the wireless provider . The wireless provider may also request a manual spidering run if an immediate update is necessary or if specific links or locations are identified for additional searching. A spider may traverse a WAP deck and retrieve the necessary metadata from which a search index is built. If the WAP page for a content item enumerates comprehensive mobile communication facility compatibility information the information may be retrieved and indexed. If the WAP pages are restricted to only handsets which are compatible the spider may emulate each known mobile communication facility type to derive compatibility information.

For a WAP deck search the wireless provider may provide one or more entry points to the spider. This may be a list of one or more URLs representing content roots. The wireless provider may provide the necessary access privileges to the WAP pages. This may entail providing information about private headers e.g. X Request that may be supplied with the HTTP requests for authentication purposes or configuring the mobile application gateway such that a spider may pass through.

In embodiments data received from the wireless provider via a data feed or spidering may be maintained on equipment which is not accessible to unauthorized personnel. Thus this data may not be directly accessible to end users. Metadata may be extracted and indexes prepared from this data which may in turn be deployed in a production environment for use with services.

In embodiments quality assurance of the platform may be attained through unit tests integration tests automated regression tests for resolved issues and or manual testing of mobile communication facilities . Testing of the platform servers may be accomplished though automated testing or manual testing. Continuous testing may be used during the development stage of a project. Release qualification testing may be used when a release has entered code freeze. A process of continuous testing may ensure that behavioral changes are intentional and that quality does not degrade over time. This may be accomplished through a combination of development policies and automated testing. Each class in the server may have unit test coverage written and maintained by developers. A specific unit test may not need to be written for each and every method since some are too small to require it and some may be difficult to test in isolation. Some or all of the individual components may be tested in isolation. Unit tests may include several groups such as smoke tests a limited set of tests intended to test the most important features and run in a small amount of time exhaustive tests a larger set of tests intended to test all areas of the product fully and performance tests a set of tests that take longer to run due to the nature of the tests being performed .

In embodiments to assist identification of quality issues a continuous build process may be used. Before each submission of code change to source control developers may run the set of smoke tests and fix any unit tests that have been broken if those changes are expected and desired . An automated build machine process may watch for changes in the source control system and initiate a smoke test build anytime it notices changes that have not been tested. This process may act as a consistency check for the checked in source code. Failures in this build may be considered emergencies and may be fixed immediately by the developer who introduced the failure. Another automated build process may build the server and run the exhaustive and regression unit test suites on scheduled intervals. Failures in this automated build are may be sent to the developers who have made changes since the previous run so that issues are known about as quickly as possible. Additional automated builds include code coverage compute and calculate coded coverage metrics code analysis check for questionable code constructs and style and performance unit test suite run the long running performance unit tests .

In embodiments the platform may render to all versions of WAP and CHTML or iMODE through the use of the WALL WURFL toolkit which detects the phone version from the user and then renders appropriately. The WAP site may take advantage of capabilities of newer WAP versions and therefore render differently on different WAP versions. Testing may be used to verify that the WAP appears and functions appropriately on different phone versions. Minimal acceptance testing may be used on previously untested phones to evaluate the phone and to locate bugs. Minimal acceptance testing may also be used on phones that have previously passed full acceptance testing after small WAP site changes. Full acceptance testing may be run on mobile communication facilities that have not previously passed full acceptance testing or after major WAP changes. Testing may include but is not limited to the following steps verify basic page layout verify that the numbering is correct that the table or list is laid out properly and that the link traversal is correct check that the content item names are indented correctly verify that the Artist Name is in the correct location verify that search term matches are highlighted check that the colors of links are correct follow every link and validate that page Full Test Only and verify the numeric access keys work.

An aspect of the present invention relates to providing useful responses to information entered into an address bar of a mobile communication facility when the information does not properly correspond with an existing URL or other website reference. In embodiments a user of a mobile communication facility may enter information into an address bar on the mobile communication facility and the information may be a misspelled URL an unknown URL or the like. In other situations the user may have been entering search terms rather than a URL thinking the address bar was the search query entry facility. There are many reasons that mis information may be entered into an address bar on a mobile communication facility and embodiments of the present invention serve to provide a user with useful information even after entering such misinformation.

In embodiments misinformation entered into the address bar of a mobile communication facility may be a wrong URL a mis typed URL may not correspond with a presently active webpage may be a broken link missing page or other information that cannot be matched with a website URL or other site indication.

The prediction associated with step may be based on a disambiguation facility e.g. as described herein in connection with a correction facility e.g. as described herein in connection with or other facility designed to predict what site the user intended to visit. For example the text entered into the address bar may have been correctly associated with a URL except for the fact that the .com was not included it was mistyped misspelled or the true extension was .net or it otherwise included erroneous extension information. A prediction facility associated with step may go through a process of including or replacing extensions to find associated web sites. As another example of misinformation included in the address bar the text may have included mistyping and the like associated with the prefix e.g. typing wwe. instead of www. or entering a comma instead of a period before the URL . A prediction facility associated with step may go through a process of including or replacing the prefix information to find associated websites. As yet another example of misinformation included in the address bar the user may have misspelled the URL entered an abbreviated URL entered search terms instead of a URL or the like. A prediction facility associated with step may go through a process of spell checking and correcting the text with what is perceived as the intended target site. In the course of predicting and correcting the text to associate the mis directed text entry the prediction facility may use other techniques for aiding the user e.g. those described in connection with correcting disambiguating and otherwise aiding the user in better targeting search query as described herein e.g. as described herein in connection with .

Once a site is predicted through step the predicted site may be entered and presented on the mobile communication facility . The process of predicting the desired site may also involve predicting and then searching for the predicted site . If the predicted site does not exist or respond a prediction facility associated with the prediction step may refine the prediction and search again. This process may be undertaken several times until a predicted site is located or until the process times out due to some preset timeout period for example.

In embodiments a process for predicting the desired site from misinformation entered into an address bar of a mobile communication facility may involve the steps of predicting the desired site after receiving an indication that no site exists or responds to the misinformation. The prediction may involve correction disambiguation or other such techniques as described herein. For example the prediction may involve using information related to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information to assist the disambiguation or correction of the misinformation. Once a prediction is made the prediction may be tested e.g. a search for a related URL may be conducted the prediction may be presented to the user as a suggestion or the site associated with the prediction may be entered and presented for example.

Once an error or other indication the desired site is unavailable is produced the text entered into the address bar may be used as a search query e.g. in a similar fashion as if the text were entered into a search query facility as described in connection with . For example the text may be disambiguated if it is ambiguous it may be corrected e.g. the spelling may be checked and corrected or suggestions related to the query disambiguated query or corrected query may be produced for the user. Once the search query corrected search query or disambiguated search query is determined it may then be used to perform a search for results . The search may produce results and or produce suggestions or other related information . For example as disclosed in connection with other embodiments herein e.g. in connection with the search results or suggestions may be produced in coordination with information relating to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information . In embodiments an algorithm facility e.g. as illustrated in connection with may be used in connection with information relating to the mobile communication facility to better predict what the user is looking for.

In embodiments a process for searching for information relating to misinformation entered into an address bar of a mobile communication facility may involve the steps of producing a search query from the text entered in the address bar after receiving an indication that no site exists or responds to the misinformation. The search query may involve correction disambiguation or other such techniques as described herein. For example the development of the search query may involve using information related to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information to assist the disambiguation or correction of the misinformation. Once a search query is made search results and or suggestions and or recommendations or other information relating to the text entered in the address bar may be presented to the user on the mobile communication facility.

The text entered from the address bar may be processed through a disambiguation facility correction facility or other facility adapted to modify the text into a form more appropriate for a search on the mobile communication facility. The processed query may then be used as a search query and a search may be performed. Results suggestions and or other information pertaining to the processed query may be produced and displayed on a display associated with the mobile communication facility .

Following the error or other indication that the site is unavailable a redirected site may be chosen . The redirection may be based on a table algorithm or information relating to the originally unavailable site indicating the correct site. For example the unavailable site may produce information indicating there is a related site. A referenced URL may be provided for example. Given this redirection information the mobile communication facility may be redirected to the new site.

In embodiments information relating to the mobile communication facility may be used to redirect the user to a redirected site. For example a user may misspell a URL and information relating to the mobile communication facility may indicate what the user intended to enter. For example mobile characteristic information may contain information showing that the user has recently viewed a site with a very similar URL to the mistyped URL entered and the previously visited site may be presented to the user. In embodiments an indication that the URL as entered was unavailable may also be presented to the user indicating a process of suggesting alternatives was used.

In embodiments the redirection search text processing results presentation suggestions or other methods of managing information entered into the address bar of a mobile communication facility may be aided through an algorithm facility . The algorithm facility may use information relating to the mobile communication facility in the process of determining what information the user is most interested in. The algorithm facility may be a collaborative filter or personal for example and the filter may use information from the mobile characteristics database in the process of delivering user targeted results.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to processing errors related to search queries and address queries entered on a mobile communication facility. In embodiments the error processing may be accomplished through software on the mobile communication facility. In embodiments the error processing may be accomplished through software remote from the mobile communication facility e.g. on a server associated with a wireless provider or associated with the wireless communication facility . In embodiments the error processing may be done using software processing in part on the mobile communication facility and in part on a platform remote from the mobile communication facility.

Once an error or the like is produced the software platform on the mobile communication facility may respond to the error in a variety of ways e.g. the error processing associated with . For example as indicated in connection with the software on the mobile communication facility may predict a desired site use the text as a search query further process the text entered redirect the mobile communication facility to another website or otherwise perform a process in response to the error . Following the error processing the mobile communication facility may generate and communicate an additional request for information . This may be similar to the requests for information described in connection with . For example a request to enter a newly predicted website e.g. as described in connection with may be made. Following the request to enter the newly predicted website an error or the like may be produced and the process may be re executed . Ultimately the mobile communication facility may receive an indication of the predicted site or the predicted site may be presented. As another example the new request may be formed as a search query or a processed query e.g. disambiguated intended to be fed into a search engine as described in connection with . As yet another example the new request may be a redirected request as described in connection with . It should be noted that a user may intend to place a search query into the location box intentionally.

Once an error or the like is produced the software platform on the server associated with the wireless provider may respond to the error in a variety of ways e.g. the error processing associated with . For example as indicated in connection with the software on the server may predict a desired site use the text as a search query further process the text entered redirect the mobile communication facility to another website or otherwise perform a process in response to the error . Following the error processing the server may generate and communicate an additional request for information . This may be similar to the requests for information described in connection with . For example a request to enter a newly predicted website e.g. as described in connection with may be made. Following the request to enter the newly predicted website an error or the like may be produced and the process may be re executed . Ultimately the mobile communication facility may receive an indication of the predicted site or the predicted site may be presented. As another example the new request may be formed as a search query or a processed query e.g. disambiguated intended to be fed into a search engine as described in connection with . As yet another example the new request may be a redirected request as described in connection with .

An aspect of the present invention relates to providing sponsored links. In embodiments a sponsor may be provided with an interface to allow it to enter sponsor information such as bidding information content to be presented in the event a bid is won contact information device compatible information profiles the sponsor is targeting locations the sponsor is targeting and the like. For example a sponsorship facility e.g. as described in connection with may be adapted with a sponsorship entry facility. The sponsorship facility may perform other functions in connection with providing sponsored links on a mobile communication facility as well. For example the sponsorship facility may facilitate a bidding process and or present the sponsored content to the mobile communication facility. In embodiments information relating to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in the sponsored link process.

In embodiments the sponsor may enter a bidding process to provide certain sponsored content to a mobile communication facility through a sponsor entry facility . The sponsor may provide bid information such as max bids for certain keyword matches content information compatibility information and the like. Once the sponsor has entered the sponsor process through the sponsor entry facility it may be in a position to display the sponsored content on a mobile communication facility in exchange for a bid amount. A user may enter a search query on the mobile communication facility the query may be transmitted to a bidding facility where a bidding process may take place to determine which sponsor s content is going to be provided to the mobile communication facility . The bidding process may result in the award of certain sponsored content as identified in the awardees information it originally indicated during the entry process. For example the sponsor may have indicated that upon an award a link or other content should be presented to the mobile communication facility.

A sponsor may present the mobile communication facility with purchasable content and a user may purchase the content through the mobile communication facility and make payment for the content through the wireless provider . For example the content may be a downloadable ringtone music file video file wall paper or the like. The sponsor may elect to provide billing for such content through the wireless provider billing facility . This may provide a convenient secure and or trusted user transaction. The user may be comfortable in purchasing the content through his wireless provider as it may provide more of an appearance that it is provided from a known source. This may generate more of a walled garden feel from the user s perspective while allowing the user to search for and or receive such content on the open web. When the sponsor allows for payment of the content through the wireless provider payment facility the wireless provider may receive a portion of the user s payment or some other compensation in return for the billing service.

In embodiments the sponsor payment facility may be used to pay for sponsored links that were awarded and or presented to a mobile communication facility . For example once sponsored content is awarded and or presented to the mobile communication facility the bidding facility may request payment for the bid amount from the sponsor payment facility . The sponsor payment facility may then process payment to the wireless provider payment facility for example.

The user interface may also include a bid entry facility . The bid entry facility may provide a sponsor with the ability to enter bid amounts and corresponding bid criteria. For example a maximum bid amount may be associated with criteria such as keyword relevancy match. In embodiments the maximum bid may be associated with simple matching criteria e.g. such as matching a keyword or it may be associated with a more complicated sting or weighted string of terms events or characteristics. For example while a sponsor may provide a maximum bid of 0.10 for a keyword match it may provide a bid of 0.15 for a combination of keyword and location or 0.20 for a combination of keyword location and phone type. As another example the sponsor may bid 0.15 for a bid associated with a location and time of day if the search is an implicit search. While certain illustrations of bid criteria associated with bid amounts have been provided it should be understood that the criteria matching may be any type of matching including without limitation weighted function matching algorithm based matching or any other type of rule based algorithmic heuristic or other matching.

For example when the sponsor enters a wireless provider s bidding system it may enter into an agreement with the wireless provider such that any presented sponsored content is paid for. The payment may come directly from the sponsor to the wireless provider for example. In embodiments a user of the mobile communication facility may interact with sponsored content e.g. click on a sponsored line and make a transaction within the sponsored content e.g. the user may purchase a music download ringtone wall paper or the like . In such embodiments the purchase price of the purchased content may appear on the user s wireless provider bill as opposed to being billed from the sponsor.

In embodiments mobile communication facility users may be classified on a combination of mobile subscriber characteristics device type location behavioral history transaction history or other parameters and the resulting classes presented in a menu format to sponsors for bidding. For example it may be possible to statistically model the user characteristics within a population of a wireless provider s customer base that are most likely to purchase tickets for a Caribbean cruise. Once this model is known all customers with approximately the profile described by the model could be grouped in a Caribbean Cruisers category. This category may then be included in a menu system along with other categories and presented to sponsors for bidding. Swimwear companies sunglass companies etc. may have an increased interest in bidding for access to the Caribbean Cruisers category because of the increased probability that users in this category have a need for their products. Summary of the many characteristics variables used in the model into a single category may make the bidding process less time consuming to sponsors and may constitute a proprietary product. Furthermore the statistical model may be continually updated to accommodate changing user preferences.

In embodiments a sponsor s website may be evaluated to determine the frequency of the appearance of key words and or key phrases. Once the keyword and or key phrase frequency is known a site relevancy score may be derived indicating the relevance of keywords to the content of a sponsor s website. This relevancy score may then be used to assist sponsors in their bidding making it easier for sponsors to focus their finances on keywords and or key phrases with the greatest relevancy to their content.

In embodiments the behaviors of mobile communication facility users may be automatically collected and the bid values in the bidding system adjusted to reflect user behaviors. For example user calls clicks clickthroughs purchases and yield optimization may be automated and used to change the value of minimum or maximum bid values associated with a keyword.

In embodiments an editorial review process may be used to evaluate the appropriateness of sponsors selections of criteria with which to associate their content. For example it may be inappropriate to have a sponsor associate adult content with keywords commonly associated with the interests of children. The editorial process may assist in locating and remedying such incongruities.

In embodiments an automated spidering tool may be used to periodically monitor changes in sponsors content and determine the reliability of the sponsor links. For example a sponsor may update a website to such an extent that the sponsor s content that was previously associated with keywords through a bidding process is no longer reliable i.e. the content is no longer located where the links direct a user . When this occurs the system may send an alert to the sponsor indicating that the reliability of the sponsor content links is insufficient. They may serve to improve the overall reliability of the system.

As illustrated in an advertisement may be presented to a mobile communication facility based at least in part on receiving a webpage request from the query facility of a mobile communication facility receiving information associated with the mobile communication facility and associating at least one advertisement with a webpage at least in part based on the information relating to the mobile communication facility . For example a user of a mobile communication facility may initiate a search query consisting of an explicit text query spelling a musician s name. The potential search results that may be presented to the user s mobile communication facility may include advertisements and websites for the musician s CD s videos of his performances etc. Alternatively a mobile communication facility user may enter an address request e.g. an internet URL requesting a specific website devoted to a musician. This address request may in turn be associated with advertisements and other websites related to the musician s CD s videos of his performances etc. Information about the mobile communication facility e.g. its video streaming capabilities may be used in order to determine which of the advertisement webpage results may be presented successfully to the user s mobile communication facility . This information may in turn be used to pair webpages and advertisements that are each capable of presenting in the display of the user s mobile communication facility .

In embodiments an implicit query may be received from a user of a mobile communication facility and used at least in part to derive associations with advertisements . For example mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules or mobile communication facility information in conjunction with time location or similar situation may suggest relevant advertisement webpage pairing recommendations for the user. The recommended advertisements may be paired with webpages presented prior to during or following the display of the advertisement results. A content request may be made by an implicit query request based at least in part on a mobile subscriber characteristic . For example a user s mobile subscriber characteristics may include the user s date of birth. Thus an implicit query may be generated on the user s birthday in order to cull advertisements related to celebration of a birthday discounts for customers on their birthdays etc. A content request may be made an implicit query request based at least in part on a characteristic of a user s mobile communication facility . For example if a mobile communication facility type is associated with a demographic e.g. age an implicit query may be initiated to cull advertisements of probable relevance to the user of that mobile communication facility type.

In embodiments a user s prior search activities and search results may also be used to create implicit query requests for the user. Prior search activities may include transactions search queries visits to websites and other acts initiated by the user on the mobile communication facility . The geographic location of the mobile communication facility may foster implicit queries including but not limited to products and services in the user s current geographic vicinity. The current time may be used independently or in conjunction with other information to create implicit queries. For example the independent fact that it is noon may initiate an implicit query for restaurants serving lunch. As with the above restaurant example similar processes for generating meaningful recommendations may be applied to other services and products including transportation food theater sports entertainment movies corporations work bank post office mail facility gas directions locations location navigation taxi bus train car airport baby sitter service provider goods provider drug store drive through bar club movie times entertainment times news and local information.

In embodiments an advertisement may be presented to a mobile communication facility based at least in part on information relating to mobile subscriber characteristics . This information may include a user s individual demographic variables contained in the mobile subscriber characteristics database such be age sex race religion an area code zip code a home address a work address a billing address credit information family information income range birth date range birthplace employer job title length of employment an affiliation or other such information as described herein. The mobile subscriber characteristic may be associated with a personal filter. The mobile subscriber characteristic may be used in conjunction with a collaborative filter. The mobile subscriber characteristic may include an aggregate of user characteristics or include a range of values. The range of values of a user characteristic may be a range of a user demographic. The range of values of a user characteristic may be a range of behaviors or a range of age.

In embodiments mobile subscriber characteristics may form parameters that limit the advertisement search results to those relevant to a mobile subscriber characteristic or profile of multiple characteristics. The display of advertisement result set s may thus omit information prioritize information e.g. presenting sponsor links prior to all others highlight a subset of the search result set or order the display of information based upon the presence or absence of mobile subscriber characteristics . Examples of representative elements that may be stored within the mobile subscriber characteristics database include location personal information relating to a user web interactions email interactions messaging interactions billing history payment history typical bill amount time of day duration of on line interactions number of on line interactions family status occupation transactions previous search queries entered history of locations phone number device identifier type of content previously downloaded content previously viewed and sites visited.

In embodiments at least one advertisement may be associated with at least one webpage at least in part based on the information relating to a mobile subscriber characteristic and mobile communication facility characteristic combination. This information may provide an indication as to what the user may be looking for at a given time and location. For example a user may be looking for transportation food a theater sports entertainment movies corporations work a bank post office mail facility gas directions locations location navigation taxi bus train car airport baby sitter service provider goods provider drug store drive through bar club movie times entertainment times news and local information.

In embodiments an advertisement may be presented to a mobile communication facility based at least in part on information relating to a mobile communication facility . This information may form parameters that limit the advertisement search results to those compatible with relevant to or preferred for presentation on a given type of mobile communication facility . The display of advertisement result set s may thus omit information prioritize information e.g. presenting sponsor links prior to all others highlight a subset of the search result set or order the display of information based upon the presence or absence of a mobile communication facility or a feature of a mobile communication facility . Examples of representative elements that may be stored within the mobile subscriber characteristics database include search history a parental control or a carrier business rule display resolution processing speed audio capability visual capability and other technical characteristics. For example an advertisement may be associated with only the subset of mobile communication facility models that are best suited for presentation of the advertisement s content due to technological requirements for the content to optimally present. For example an advertisement may have content that requires a Java enabled device. Therefore it may be desirable for the advertisement to present its content only on those mobile communication facilities that are Java enabled.

In embodiments advertising and webpage content compatibility with a type of mobile communication facility may be determined at least in part by tracking a plurality of mobile communication facility interactions with such content. Information may be stored pertaining to the advertising and web interactions in a database where a portion of the information comprises identification of at least one mobile communication facility from the plurality of mobile communication facilities and predicting the compatibility of the mobile communication facility with the content based in part on how many content interactions there were. The prediction of compatibility of the mobile communication facility with content may be based in part on how many interactions there were in the user s past. Content may be a download program file executable file zipped file compressed file audio and video. An advertising or web interaction may be a click on a hyperlink an indication of downloaded content and or an indication of a downloaded program.

In embodiments advertising content may be associated with webpage content and the at least one mobile subscriber characteristic and or the at least one mobile communication facility characteristic.

In embodiments an advertisement may be associated with at least one webpage based at least in part on information relating to a mobile communication provider. The information relating to a mobile communication provider may include but is not limited to a graphical trademark audible signal a recording of a person reading the slogan trademark of a mobile communication provider a distinctive audio tone or combinations of tones associated with a mobile communication provider or a video stream such as an audio visual commercial.

In embodiments the past performance or other information relating to a mobile communication facility may be stored aggregated and analyzed on a remote server and database wireless provider data facility the mobile communication facility or other similar facilities. Past performance may include but is not limited to past content interaction content download audio content streaming video content streaming content contained in java cookies content contained in temporary internet files stored on the mobile communication facility past transaction information and the like.

In embodiments an algorithm facility may perform algorithms including algorithms for associating information relating to the past performance of a mobile communication facility or other information relating to the mobile communication facility. For example an algorithm facility may include an algorithm to determine the cumulative frequency of a given past performance e.g. downloading an MP3 file within a single mobile communication facility or group of mobile communication facilities. Content may be categorized into a yellow pages like taxonomy and this taxonomy mapped onto the past performance of a mobile communication facility or group of mobile communication facilities. The taxonomies may then be ordered according a descending order of the cumulative rank associated with the mobile communication facility or group of mobile communication facilities. For example applying such an algorithm to a user s mobile communication facility past performance may result in a content taxonomy cumulative frequency rank similar to the following e.g. where each number represents the cumulative discrete content interactions MP3 92 Ringtones 43 Online Musical Instrument Sites 16 Newspaper websites 2 Business Week Magazine Website 1. Based on this array of data the relevancy of content may be inferred and as a result content related to music listening to and playing given a higher priority rank than content related to news.

In embodiments an algorithm may also correlate past performances within a single mobile communication facility or group of mobile communication facilities. For example an algorithm may compute a correlation coefficient to describe the association between the past performance of downloading an MP3 file and purchasing a concert ticket online using a mobile communication facility . This coefficient may in turn form the basis for ordering content for presentation to a mobile communication facility . For example it may be found that within a single mobile communication facility past performances or a group of such facilities the download of MP3 files is positively correlated with online concert ticket purchases with a coefficient of 0.23 whereas download of MP3 files is positively correlated with the download of real estate listings with only a coefficient of 0.04. This information may be used to rank the relevancy of content such that a person with a past performance of an MP3 download is presented content related to concert ticket purchases more frequently than with preference to with prioritized placement within the mobile communication facility display over to the exclusion of and so on any content related to real estate listings. This information may also be used to infer the appropriateness and likelihood of content interaction. For example a mobile communication facility with many past performances of MP3 downloads but no online concert ticket purchases may be a prime candidate to receive ticket purchase content and or receive ticket purchase content with priority over news content and so forth.

In embodiments the algorithm types described above may also be used to assess the relevancy priority positioning placement and so forth of content based upon information associated with the mobile communication facility a capability of the mobile communication facility a user associated with the mobile communication facility an owner of the mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic s carrier information or other information that may be used as a predictor of the likelihood of an interaction with the sponsored content. The capability of a mobile communication facility may include but is not limited to audio capabilities video capabilities visual capabilities processing capability screen capability and the like. User characteristics may include but are not limited to user history information demographic information transaction history location information user billing information personal filters and the like. A mobile subscriber characteristic may include but is not limited to user transaction history user location personal information relating to a user user web interactions email interactions messaging interactions billing history payment history typical bill amount time of day duration of on line interactions number of on line interactions family status occupation previous search queries history of locations phone number device identifier type of content previously downloaded previous content viewed websites visited and the like. Mobile subscriber characteristics may also include demographic information. Demographic information may include but is not limited to age sex race religion an area code zip code a home address a work address a billing address credit information family information income range birth date range birthplace employer job title length of employment or an affiliation and the like. A mobile service provider characteristic may include but is not limited to a carrier business rule the geographic region in which the mobile service provider s service is available to consumers walled garden content and the like.

An aspect of the present invention involves a method for receiving a website request from a mobile carrier gateway receiving contextual information relating to the requested website associating the received contextual information with a mobile content and displaying the mobile content with the website on a mobile communication facility .

A mobile communication facility used to make a website request may be one or more of a phone a mobile phone a cellular phone a GSM phone a GPRS phone a WAP enabled phone a satellite phone a WiFi phone a wireless device a pager a personal digital assistant or the like. The website request may be sent through a mobile carrier gateway which then initiates a context review request of the requested website . The requested website may be one or more of the following a webpage a document an image video audio or some other website. A server may respond to the context review request by accessing the website and performing a context review of the website . The result of the context review may be the identification of contextual information associated with the website . The identified contextual information may then be sent back to the server . The contextual information may include one or more of the following a link a link structure an inbound link to the website an outbound link from the website a reciprocal link text a keyword metadata website usage patterns website usage statistics or the like. For example a user of a mobile communication facility may execute a website request for a website containing the Amtrak schedule for trains from Boston Mass. to New York City N.Y. Contextual information associated with the Amtrak schedule website may include for example keywords such as travel train vacation Boston and New York outbound links to local weather in Boston and New York City or an inbound link from a travel agency website. Once identified one or more pieces of contextual information related to the Amtrak schedule website may be sent back to a server .

The server may receive contextual information and then associate it with a mobile content . Optionally the server may store contextual information associated with a particular website to facilitate subsequent context review requests originating from either the same or a different mobile subscriber. The mobile content may relate to one or more of the following an advertisement sponsored content a sponsored call an image a video text a search box a pay per click link a pay per call link or some other mobile content . For instance if the contextual information is the keyword vacation the associated mobile content may be a search box for an airfare metasearch engine an advertisement for an all inclusive resort in Cancun or a review of an exotic destination. When the mobile content is a search box the search box may relate to a local site search box an advertisement search box a carrier portal search box or some other such search box. For example the local site search box may only query the requested website while the carrier portal search box may provide for queries of a greater collection of websites.

The mobile content may also be optionally branded using a wireless carrier brand. For example the mobile content may be a search box that employs the technology of a third party search engine but bears a name a logo a trademark a slogan a graphic audio video an image or some other representation of the wireless carrier brand.

In order to deliver pertinent mobile content with the requested website to the mobile communication facility the association between the received contextual information and mobile content may be based at least in part on a relevance. For example the relevance may be related to a mobile subscriber characteristic. For instance if a subscriber who is a senior citizen requests a website for which derived contextual information includes the term vacation relevant associated mobile content may be an advertisement for a seniors cruise and not one for spring break in Cancun.

Relevance may also be based at least in part on the relationship between the contextual information and the mobile content . For example the relationship may be a similarity or dissimilarity of the contextual information and the mobile content . Mobile content that exhibits greater similarity to the contextual information than other mobile content may be considered more relevant and therefore more likely to be displayed along with the website on the mobile communication facility . In contrast mobile content that is dissimilar to the contextual information may not be deemed relevant and may be lowered in priority for display. For example the contextual information may be an outbound link to a bookstore s website e.g. Barnes Noble Border s . A link to a bookstore may be considered similar to mobile content that includes an Amazon.com search box or an advertisement for a popular author s latest release. A link to a bookstore may be considered dissimilar to mobile content that includes an advertisement for a flat screen television.

Relevance may also be based at least in part on the relationship between stored contextual information and or mobile content originating from a previous website request by the mobile subscriber and the current pool of mobile content . Mobile content to be delivered to the mobile communication facility may be identified as relevant by association to contextual information from a previously viewed website . For example even though the current website request is for an international news website based on previous derived contextual information which included shopping and home furnishings the delivered mobile content may be a search box for Target.com.

Once a mobile content has been associated with the received contextual information the mobile content may be displayed with the website on the mobile communication facility . The mobile content may be displayed interstitially or concomitantly with the website . Optionally the mobile content displayed may be stored on a server .

In some embodiments of the method an opt in function may be provided to an entity associated with the website wherein the opt in function registers the website for automatic contextual syndication. The contextual information may be provided by a server involved in sending the mobile communication facility the website . The server may be one or more of the following a WAP server a mobile application gateway a WAP gateway a proxy server a web server or the like.

While the invention has been disclosed in connection with the preferred embodiments shown and described in detail various modifications and improvements thereon will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly the spirit and scope of the present invention is not to be limited by the foregoing examples but is to be understood in the broadest sense allowable by law.

A user generally may perceive relevant mobile content as more beneficial than random mobile content. Therefore mobile content that is relevant to a user may have a greater value to the content provider because the user may be more likely to interact with the content in a way that is favorable to the objectives of the provider such as making a purchase or opting in for an offer. Consequently delivering relevant mobile content to a user of a mobile communication facility may provide benefits for the user mobile service provider and content provider.

Delivering relevant mobile content to a user may be associated with the delivery of a website or webpage content to a mobile communication facility . By associating the delivery of relevant content with deliver of a webpage a user of a mobile communication facility may already be anticipating new information being displayed on the mobile communication facility . Also the relevant mobile content may be relevant to the delivered webpage thereby reinforcing the relevance of the mobile content with the user.

A website or webpage and associated mobile content may be delivered to and displayed or played such as for video or audio on a mobile communication facility based on a variety of actions or conditions. One such action is the user explicitly requesting the website or from the wireless provider . As a result of the request the wireless provider may select mobile content from a variety sources of mobile content such that the selected mobile content may have a relevance to the user and or the website.

The variety of sources of mobile content may include without limitation the internet a data facility of the wireless provider a content walled garden an advertiser data a sponsor a server a search facility and a sponsorship facility . As herein described the sponsorship facility may provide some relevance matching of mobile subscriber characteristics e.g. user behavioral information to sponsored mobile content. To facilitate relevance matching in the sponsorship facility the wireless communication facility may provide criteria such as mobile subscriber characteristics or user behavioral information or location information and requested URL to the sponsorship facility .

The mobile content may interact with the mobile communication facility such that certain user interface elements of the mobile communication facility may allow a user to directly respond to the source of the mobile content. Such interaction may allow the mobile communication facility to directly interact with the source of the mobile content even while the mobile communication facility is performing other functions such as web browsing audio calling and the like.

In an example a mobile communication facility may have a variable function key included with the user interface. When mobile content is received by the mobile communication facility the variable function key may become an opt in key for an offer of the mobile content. The user may automatically opt in to an offer of the mobile content by activating the variable function key. Appropriate user information may be provided to the website or provider of the mobile content to activate the user s subscription or agreement to opt in to the offer.

A webpage may be delivered to a mobile communication facility based on actions or conditions other than a user request. A webpage may be delivered based on actions such as a call being received or initiated by the mobile communication facility a location change of the mobile communication facility a power on of the mobile communication facility and many other actions or conditions described herein that may be associated with a mobile communication facility in a wireless search platform . Mobile content may also be selected based at least in part on information related to the action or condition. In an example as a result of a user completing a phone call with an electronics retailer a webpage and associated mobile content inviting the user to view current special offers from a competitive electronics retailer may be displayed on the mobile communication facility . In another example the wireless provider may detect the location change of the mobile communication facility and deliver a webpage with associated mobile content containing a local weather forecast and local restaurants based on a relevance to a user characteristic.

A server may be used to select mobile content such that it has a relevance to the user for delivery. In an example a user s history may include some or substantially all transactions that the user has initiated from a mobile communication facility . In this user history the user may have demonstrated a preference or tendency to interact with mobile content that is associated with jazz music. The user may also have executed a plurality of queries related to jazz music. Therefore delivering mobile content that is associated with jazz music may have a relevance to the user. A server may select and store a variety of mobile content based on such types of relevance and make it available to a wireless provider to facilitate delivering relevant mobile content to a user.

The behavioral information to which the mobile content may be associated to establish relevance may be based on an individual user or a group of users. The group of users may be users with one or more characteristic in common. The characteristic may be related to the user user characteristic the mobile communication facility a location of the mobile communication facility a time or some other characteristic.

The relevant mobile content may be an advertisement or another type of mobile content such as sponsored content a sponsored call a search box and the like. The relevant mobile content format may be selected based at least in part on a relevance to the user behavioral information. A user may have indicated explicitly or through specific actions with the mobile communication facility a preference for mobile content that includes both audio and video. This user behavioral information may be used to select between similar mobile content to provide the most relevant mobile content to the user. Methods and systems for associating mobile content with behavioral information related to a user of a mobile communication facility as herein disclosed may also be applied to selecting the mobile content in association with a website.

In embodiments interaction information relating to a mobile communication facility may be used to weight content and the content may be ordered for presentation on a mobile communication facility based at least in part on the weighting. For example interaction information may be based on transaction events purchase history user history user characteristic user device geographic location time expertise occupation income bracket home address and the like. A user who has made several online book purchases during the past week related to baseball may as a result of this past behavior have sports content weighted favorably and prioritized for placement on his mobile communication facility . This interaction information may also be used to weight and prioritize content for other mobile communication facility users who share some attribute or plurality of attributes e.g. age income etc. with the user who purchased the baseball books. As interaction information is collected it may be stored and analyzed in the aggregate in order to derive weights for mobile content and prioritize the presentation of content based upon information relating to mobile subscriber characteristics mobile communication facility characteristics and other information relating to users.

In embodiments mobile content may include but is not limited to downloadable content sponsored links a URL an email address an FTP address a phone call and webpage address an advertisement a sponsored content an audio stream a video a graphic element and the like. In embodiments information that may be related to interaction information may be segmented e.g. an age range income range etc. .

In embodiments mobile content interaction information may be derived from mobile communication facilities such as a phone a cell phone a mobile phone a GSM phone a personal digital assistant a pocket personal computer and the like.

In embodiments the mobile content interaction information may be a plurality of mobile content interaction information. The weighting of mobile content may be based upon a plurality of mobile content interaction information.

Interaction information relating to mobile content e.g. a website downloadable content sponsored link sponsored call sponsored content advertisement search result etc. may be used to weight the content. In situations the weighting is similar in nature to a link analysis but here the number of separate interactions with the content may be used in a calculation to judge how popular or otherwise relevant the mobile content is. In embodiments not every interaction with the mobile content is weighted equally. An interaction from a user that has a greater authority may be deemed more relevant or it may be deemed more as an indication of the actual value of the mobile content and therefore the interactions from this particular user may be provided a greater weight. For example two users may interact with a particular piece of mobile content. The first user may have a little on line history because he is a relatively new user of the web service provided through his mobile communication facility. The first user may interact with the mobile content many times and this many interactions may be logged and used in a calculation to determine how popular the mobile content is. The second user may be a frequent user of web services through his mobile communication facility e.g. as determined through mobile subscriber characteristics as described herein elsewhere . This user may interact with the mobile content a limited number of times e.g. once or twice . The limited number of interactions may be used in conjunction with the first users many interactions to judge the popularity of the mobile content. The second users few interactions may however be given a higher weight because he may be considered to have more authority in the calculation because of his status as a frequent web services user as compared with the beginner status of the first user. The result may be to significantly discount the first user s interaction history with the mobile content and increase the reliance on the few interactions from the second user. This may effectively reduce the popularity ranking of the mobile content as compared to a calculation simply based on the number of interactions with the mobile content.

In embodiments it is the user s apparent authority in predicting the value of the interaction that provides a weighting to the user s actual interaction with mobile content. This user s authority can be used to decrease or increase the weighting of his interaction such that the popularity relevance or other such parameter of the mobile content is based more heavily on interactions from authoritative users as opposed to just any user that happens to interact with the content. A user s authority may be based on their user history transaction history online behavior web services usage type of mobile communication facility or other parameter which is tracked monitored evaluated measured recorded or otherwise stored in relation to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristics for example. The information relied on to evaluate the authority of the user may be stored in the mobile communication facility associated with the user or it may be stored remotely e.g. in a mobile subscriber characteristics database associated with the wireless provider . When stored with the wireless provider or other third party the wireless provider may be the entity providing the authority information or performing the authority calculation.

In embodiments each mobile communication facility user may be rated with a general and or specific authority ranking. For example a user may have a history of using web services through his mobile communication facility and be deemed to have a high general authority ranking. The same user may have a history that suggests he is a frequent user of local search systems so he may receive a specific high authority ranking for local mobile content interactions. In embodiments the general authority ranking may be based on the user s use of web services web content websites transactions purchases downloads views listens streaming viewing or other such general web interactions. In embodiments the specific authority ranking may be based on more specific categories of interactions such as local interactions implicit interactions interactions resulting from an implicit search pay per call interactions sponsored links interactions advertisement interactions search result interactions or other such specific category of interaction. In embodiments the specific authority ranking may be based on a specific interaction such as an interaction with a specific phone number specific piece of content e.g. such as the highest ranked content known such as the highest ranked advertisement .

A sponsor using mobile content to sell its products or services within a wireless platform may find it advantageous to have information regarding the expected value that it may derive from sponsoring a mobile content. By knowing an expected value associated with a mobile content a sponsor may be able to select those sponsorship opportunities from which it is most likely to derive revenue. The expected value may assist a sponsor in budgeting for an advertising program based on the total expected revenue to be derived from an advertising program. Behavioral metrics such as clickthrough volume and conversion volume may be used to predict future consumer interactions with mobile content. Financial metrics such as product price profit margin and the like may be used to indicate the financial results of associating a given product with the behavioral metrics related to a mobile content. Expected value calculations may be beneficial for sponsors such as advertisers wireless information providers wireless carriers wireless operators telecommunications providers and the like.

In embodiments an expected value calculation may indicate to a sponsor the expected revenue that it may be predicted to receive from a sponsorship such as an advertising program. Such an expected revenue calculation may be performed by multiplying a clickthrough parameter associated with a mobile content by the conversion associated with that content by the purchase price of the product that is the subject of the content. In this calculation the clickthrough parameter may represent the cumulative number of times the content is accessed i.e. clicked the click through rate or other parameter associated with the interactivity with the content. The conversion may represent the cumulative number of transactions such as a purchase associated with the content the transaction rate associated with the content or other parameter associated with the transactions associated with the content. The purchase price may be a manufacturer s suggested retail price a price explicitly set by the content provider a price unique to a specific user s conversion or a product price resulting from some other price setting protocol. The expected revenue may also be calculated as a bid weighted revenue in which the expected revenue is multiplied by a bid amount.

In embodiments an expected value calculation may indicate to a sponsor or wireless carrier the expected margin that it may be predicted to receive from a sponsorship such as an advertising program. Such an expected margin calculation may be performed by multiplying the clickthrough associated with a mobile content by the conversion associated with that content by the margin of the product that is the subject of the content. Margin may include but is not limited to an expected advertiser margin an expected wireless carrier s margin the profit margin associated with a product and the like. The expected margin may also be calculated as a bid weighted margin in which the expected margin is multiplied by a bid amount.

In embodiments an expected value calculation may indicate to a sponsor or wireless carrier the expected yield that it may be predicted to receive from a sponsorship such as an advertising program. Such an expected yield calculation may be performed by multiplying a bid associated with a mobile content by the clickthrough associated with that content. Similarly an expected conversion yield may be calculated by multiplying a yield associated with a mobile content by the conversion associated with that content.

In embodiments an expected value calculation may indicate to a sponsor wireless carrier wireless operator or telecommunications provider the average time spent on a target website and the average depth of use a target website by users visiting the website.

In embodiments an expected value calculation related to a mobile content may be segmented by a characteristic associated with a mobile communication facility. For example the expected value may be segmented by a characteristic including but not limited to a display capability display size display resolution processing speed audio capability video capability cache size storage capability memory capacity and the like. In embodiments the expected value may also be segmented by a mobile subscriber characteristic including but not limited to age sex race religion area code zip code home address work address billing address credit information family information income information birth date birthplace employer job title length of employment user history user transactions geographic location time and the like. The segmented expected value may provide information relating to the expected value within a given segmentation.

One example of many potential examples of how an expected value may be used by a sponsor is described below. Content sponsors may seek to sponsor content that they believe is most likely to be accessed by persons or entities interested enough in their products or services that a conversion e.g. purchase will result. One of the primary functions of market research is to gain insight into consumer profiles that are most associated with past conversions and to provide information on other consumer profiles that may represent the untapped market share of consumers currently unfamiliar with but likely to purchase the provider s products. For example in a traditional medium such as television a sponsor may purchase market research regarding the demographic profile number of viewers length of average viewing time etc. associated with a particular primetime situation comedy. Based on prior market research a sponsor may have regarding the profiles of its past consumers the sponsor may make an educated guess as to the appropriateness of sponsoring content e.g. advertising during the sitcom based on the level of concurrence between the sitcom viewers and the sponsor s past consumers. The higher the level of concurrence the greater the probability that purchases will result from the advertising and the greater the expected value that the company may presume it will receive on its advertising expenditures. Furthermore the greater specificity with which a consumer profile may be described e.g. not California but rather Area Code 90210 the more accurately a sponsor may potentially target its intended consumers and increase its expected value.

In response to a mobile content search initiated by a user of a mobile communication facility a mobile content provider may deliver sponsored content advertisements sponsored call numbers or other sponsored content to the mobile communication facility based at least in part on a relevance to the search query. In addition to selecting among a variety of sponsored advertisements a mobile content provider may also select a sponsored content such as an advertisement from a variety of sources or mobile content inventories. Different sources of sponsored content may have unique arrangements relating to cost derived revenues wall garden restrictions blacklisted content whitelisted content and the like. Therefore it may be advantageous for a mobile content provider to select mobile content from the available mobile content inventories based at least in part on optimizing the benefits for the mobile content provider.

In one embodiment a cross inventory yield optimization method may include determining which mobile content inventory provides the greatest clickthrough value. As an example a first mobile content inventory may pass through a higher percentage of an advertisement impression bid than a second inventory. Therefore by selecting the mobile content from the first inventory greater revenues may be generated when the content is presented to a mobile communication facility.

Cross inventory yield optimization of mobile content may assist in generating greater revenue for a presenter of the content than non optimized content. Methods and systems of optimizing the yield of presenting mobile content on a mobile communication facility may include a variety of factors. One or more of the factors may be evaluated in the context of an objective of the optimization. For example one objective of optimizing yield may be to generate the greatest likelihood of receiving clickthrough revenue associated with the presentation of mobile content. As such content may be preferentially selected based at least in part on factors that advance this objective such as the clickthrough rate associated with a mobile content or the revenue derived per click of the mobile content cost per thousand revenue cost per acquisition and so forth. In another example an objective of the cross inventory yield optimization may be to preferentially select mobile content that is the most compatible with a mobile communication facility based upon criteria such as screen resolution memory capacity video capability and the like.

A method for determining which among a plurality of content inventories provides the greatest value may include comparing the impression bid offering from each inventory provider and selecting the highest bid offering. Alternatively an advertisement with a lower impression revenue may be selected if it pays a higher clickthrough revenue and the clickthrough rate results in greater revenue. In these examples one can appreciate how the objective of optimization may impact which factors associated with an advertisement are preferred.

There may be available a choice of mobile content such as advertisements for different products or services each of which may have a relevance to a mobile search. Determining which of the advertisements may generate the greatest revenue may include factors related to the advertisement. Factors may include without limitation popularity of the advertisement clickthrough rate and freshness of the content advertisement or call number and so forth. As an example a very popular advertisement that is relevant to the search may provide a more optimal revenue opportunity than a less popular yet relevant advertisement due to the increased odds that the popular advertisement will be viewed interacted with will produce a clickthrough and the like. In another example an advertisement with a higher clickthrough rate may present a more optimal revenue opportunity than an advertisement with a lower clickthrough rate since the advertiser pays the clickthrough bid for a higher percentage of impressions. An advertisement sponsored call number or other sponsored content that is freshest i.e. has been more recently updated or verified may also provide a greater revenue opportunity. In an example advertisements may present an event that has recently had a change in venue. An advertisement that has been updated since the venue change may be more likely to provide clickthrough revenue than one that presents the obsolete venue. Therefore a method for optimizing cross inventory yield may include assessing advertisement popularity clickthrough rate or freshness of content.

Optimizing cross inventory yield may include factors associated with a user of a mobile communication facility such as a user characteristic as herein described. A user history utilized in optimizing cross inventory yield is described in the following example. A user history may include metrics associated with a user s actions when presented with advertisements sponsored content and or sponsored call numbers. The history may indicate that a user more often follows through with a sponsored call number than with a sponsored advertisement. Therefore presenting a sponsored call number to this user may optimize the revenue generated. Consequently a cross inventory yield optimization method may preferentially select a sponsored call number to present to this user instead of a non call number based mobile content item.

The mode in which a mobile communication facility user enters a search query may also be factored into optimizing cross inventory yield. Since a mobile communication facility may have multiple independent modes of entry e.g. voice keypad touchscreen camera and the like the selection of a mobile content advertisement sponsored content or sponsored call number may optimized based at least in part on the mode of query entry. For example a user who issues a search query using a keypad entry may be more likely to be viewing the mobile communication facility than listening to it. As a result selecting an advertisement with little display content and significant audio content may reduce the yield associated with the content relative to a more visually based mobile content. However voice entry of a search query may be indicative of a user that prefers an audio based mobile content.

A cross inventory yield optimization method or system may combine factors to optimize revenue for mobile content advertisements sponsored content or sponsored call number presentation. Yield optimization may include factors associated with a user a mobile communication facility a location the advertisement content number revenue e.g. impression and clickthrough bids payment terms and the like. In an example an English speaking user may be traveling to Paris and may enter a search query. An optimization method may combine factors such as user language preference English with location Paris with payment terms pay in USD and popularity French current events and revenue impression bid . The above is only an example and many other combinations of factors are possible and may be used singly or in combination as part of an cross inventory yield optimization method and system.

As previously described a wireless search platform may be associated with a plurality of datasets from which consumer profiles may be derived for use in targeting content e.g. advertisements sponsored content sponsored call numbers deriving estimates of the expected value associated with content and expected value estimates for content segmented by information relating to a mobile communication facility. By receiving information on the clickthrough volume and conversion volume associated with content a sponsor may forecast based upon it s products purchase prices profit margins and the like an appropriate bid amount for a content and the probable financial results it will derive from sponsoring the content. A wireless platform may include information relating to a wireless provider a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristics location and so forth. Thus a sponsor may receive an expected value for mobile content that it may want to sponsor that is segmented by information relating to a mobile communication facility in order to identify the most profitable population within which to sponsor content.

For example a sponsor specializing in Boston Red Sox memorabilia may use expected value data segmented by information such as a user s device characteristics demographics and current location to predict which content and which population of mobile users may be associated with the greatest expected value. The memorabilia company may find that there is a high expected value for sponsoring content that is associated with a high clickthrough and conversion volume among men making 100 000 per annum and whose current location is the zip code of Boston. This level of expected value segmentation may allow the company to identify and sponsor that content with a greater likelihood of financial benefit and minimize sponsorship of content that may be associated with little or no likely benefit to the company.

In embodiments sponsors may be offered an opportunity to bid for the placement of content on a mobile communication facility display and user interface based upon an anticipated expected value that is associated with the placement of the content. Such a bid may occur in the form of an auction a reverse auction or a partially randomized auction. The content that is the subject of a bidding process may include but is not limited to an advertisement a sponsored link such as an URL email address FTP address or phone call an advertisement a sponsored call an audio stream a video a graphic element and the like.

In embodiments content that is the subject of the bidding process may be placed on a query page home page search page on a sponsored links portion of the user interface or on a page of the user interface that may be associated with a set of search results or a specific result.

The anticipated expected value may be determined by an expected value estimation facility. The expected value estimation facility may be based on an expected value calculation associated with a variable or variables selected from the group consisting of the amount of the bid the location of the media item in the user interface the duration of the presentation of the media item in the user interface the probability that a user will view the media item if placed in the user interface the probability that the user will interact with the media item if placed in the user interface the probability that the user will view interact with and or execute a transaction associated with the media item and the value of the transaction to the bidder for example. In embodiments the expected value estimation facility may be dynamic in that a change of a bid amount automatically adjusts the expected value estimation based on this new economic data.

In embodiments a bidder may be able to pre select the location within the mobile communication facility display that it seeks to place content. Similarly duration of the time that the content displays may also be selected.

In embodiments the probability that a user will view interact with and or execute a transaction in association with content may be based upon mobile subscriber characteristics mobile communication facility type mobile communication facility characteristics and other data types that may be part of or related to a wireless platform . Examples of mobile subscriber characteristics includes but is not limited to age sex race religion area code zip code home address work address billing address credit information family information income information birth date birthplace employer job title length of employment and the like.

Examples of mobile communication facility characteristics includes but is not limited to display capability display size display resolution processing speed audio capability video capability cache size storage capability memory capacity and the like.

In embodiments the value of a transaction to a bidder i.e. the expected value to the bidder may be based on one or more of the price of an item described in the media item the net price of an item described in the media item the cost of the item described in the media item the value of the attention of a user to the media item the value of the brand presented in the media item value attributed to the goodwill of the mobile subscriber value attributed to multiple items presented in the media item the revenue associated with a transaction executed by a mobile subscriber in connection with interaction with the media item the net revenue associated with a transaction executed by a mobile subscriber in connection with interaction with the media item and the probability that executing a transaction associated with the media item will result in another transaction with the bidder. Value may be expressed as a net present value a discounted rate or a discounted value. A bidder may be able to personally adjust the discount rate.

In embodiments a bidder may be able to enter an item of data associated with one or more of the amount of the bid the location of the media item in the user interface the duration of the presentation of the media item in the user interface the probability that a user will view the media item if placed in the user interface the probability that the user will interact with the media item if placed in the user interface the probability that the user will execute a transaction associated with the media item and the value of the transaction to the bidder.

As was described above for the process of bidding on the presentation of content based at least in part on the anticipated expected value associated with the content s display so too may a bidding process present an opportunity to bid based upon an anticipated yield associated with the display of a given content. A yield estimation facility may be based on an yield calculation associated with a variable selected from the group consisting of the amount of the bid the location of the media item in the user interface the duration of the presentation of the media item in the user interface the probability that a user will view the media item if placed in the user interface the probability that the user will interact with the media item if placed in the user interface and the probability that the user will execute a transaction associated with the media item.

In embodiments a method and system may be provided for the indexing searching and displaying of WAP and Web results URLs in a unified result set by a search engine. For this the search result page may provide a single and unified results set that may consist of only WAP URLs only Web URLs or a combination of both based on factors including but not limited to information relating to a mobile communication facility.

The information may be accessed stored and shared based on rules defined by a mobile communication facility user and or mobile operator.

In embodiments a method and system of query classification may be used to identify user intent in order to assist navigation to a specific vertical of content and or to flash in content from a likely answer source. A user s search behaviors may be analyzed and monitored on a consistent basis to understand what the user is searching for and selecting as a result of a search. In embodiments a search engine may classify different types of queries to connect user s searches to the right content in the shortest distance. Thus a search for ice cream boston may give preference to local listing results to general web pages and the search UA 123 may return flight arrival and departure information.

In embodiments a search engine may use query classification to identify the intent and specificity of a user s search to either redirect the user to the best individual results or to prioritize categories of results answering the user s query. In embodiments both language specific rules and statistical methods may be used to identify user intent. Language specific rules may identify narrow searches and re direct the user to specific results. For example if a user searches for maps nyc language specific rules may identify the operative term maps and a specific location nyc and infer that the user is looking for a map of New York. In this example the user may be directed to a map of New York provided by a maps vertical. Statistical methods a second query classification tool may rank different categories of results for broader queries. For example if a user is searching for a celebrity name such as Naomi Campbell a model through historical behavior it may be inferred that the user is more likely to be looking for images or news articles rather than for music and thus return these categories at the top of the results set on the first page.

In embodiments the heuristics of query classification engine may be adjusted globally on a per language or per operator basis. Query classification may identify different patterns of search behavior that assists the correct display for a given query. The classification may become more granular as the system learns more user behavior.

In embodiments the display of a mobile communication facility may include a widget to answer a user s query help a user to disambiguate their query guide a user deeper into content properties and bubble up the most popular and or relevant content. Widgets may utilize structured and semi structured data to help users to minimize searching for content and answer a user s queries directly. In addition to the query classification a learning algorithm may use click and impression analysis to determine when an answer result should be shown where on the page it should be shown and or how much content from a given source should be displayed. While the algorithm may determine the correct results set it may be possible to inject editorial overrides and influence the display of content for queries based at least in part to actively manage merchandise query results.

In embodiments editors may import export common format feeds keywords choose display templates and assign a content component type a relevancy weight. For example the query music may be too broad to rely entirely on algorithms instead an editorial or business review may be required. Through session and user behavior analysis editors may identify content that will help narrow the search and get closer to what the user actually intended. In the case of the query music an editor may build a smart component to expose genre links navigational links that take users deeper into the music vertical and a video link. If these links don t perform well then the editor may make adjustments.

In embodiments a popularity management tool may allow an editor to review algorithm weightings and adjust thresholds for a smart component and its affiliated content.

In embodiments a method and system of query classification may affect the display logic that is associated with a mobile communication facility. In an example a search query may be classified according to a query classification scheme.

In response to this external variable the user s mobile communication facility may present a sponsored content through which the user may obtain alternate traffic route information in order to avoid the traffic delay.

In embodiments a promotion may be presented to a user of a mobile communication facility in which the promotion requires the user to search for a content solve a puzzle break a code follow a clue or perform some other activity in order to derive the promotional benefit.

In embodiments a coupon may be presented to a mobile communication facility in the form of a code that may be presented to an offline location to derive the coupon s benefit. The act of the user presenting the coupon may be entered and stored in a data storage facility. This stored data may be associated with user characteristics mobile communication facility characteristics and the like and these associations may be used to present targeted advertisements coupons cross sell up sell and so forth to users. A sponsor may be charged a fee by a mobile service provider for each instance of its mobile subscribers presenting such a coupon.

In embodiments the most influential members of a social network may be identified and sponsored content directed to them. Influential members of a social network may be identified by the number of persons listed as members of their network the number of other social network members listing a social network member within their personal network SMS traffic number of purchases or based on some other measure of personal influence. In embodiments sponsors may bid on the right to provide their sponsored content to members of a social network based at least in part on a social network member s level of influence. The level of influence of social network members may be indexed and stored in a data storage facility. The content of the index of social network members influence may be licensed to mobile service providers third parties and the like.

In embodiments sponsors may be able to bid for the exclusive right to have their content associated with a keyword location or some other data.

Referring to in embodiments sponsors may be able to bid for exclusive sponsored content delivery to user mobile communication facilities such as to a phone a mobile phone a cellular phone a GSM phone and the like. Examples of situations that may lend themselves to a sponsorship model where sponsors competitively bid against each other may include a grouping of car dealerships in close proximity clothing stores in a mall multiple food stores in the same town head to head competitors such as Borders and Barnes Noble Lowes and Home Depot and the like restaurants in the same vicinity and the like. In embodiments a bidding model for direct competition for exclusive sponsored content delivery through the user s mobile communication facility may be effective in any situation where competitive sponsors are targeting the same exclusivity characteristics of users.

In embodiments a method and system for exclusivity bidding for mobile sponsored content. In embodiments a bid may be received for exclusive sponsored content for presentation to a user s mobile communication facility where the bid may include a bid amount and at least one exclusivity characteristic relating to the user such as from a mobile subscriber characteristic database a usage history database a location database a transaction database a mobile communication device characteristic database and the like. The bid may be submitted as a part of a competitive auction as an open bid as a closed bid and the like. In addition the exclusivity characteristic may be matched to the exclusive sponsored content item based at least in part on a relevancy for presentation to the mobile communication facility such as a score or rating. For instance Route 202 in Flemington N.J. has 18 new car dealerships all on the same strip of road including Audi BMW Buick Chevrolet Chrysler Dodge Ford GMC Infiniti Jeep Lincoln Mercury Nissan Mazda Pontiac Porsche Subaru and Volkswagen. This large collection of new car dealerships presents a strong competition for potential buyers coming to the area to shop for cars. A user may know that this area has virtually every major car brand on the market and may visit the area with little prior knowledge of what each of the dealerships are currently offering in the way of sales and available models such as their current stock of certified used cars. This may be a situation where users may gain buyer direction as to where they are going to first look based on sponsored content delivered to their mobile communication facility as they drive into the area and car dealership sponsors may be willing to bid for exclusive access to a user s mobile communication facility where the delivery of the sponsored content is based at least in part on information relating to the user s mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristics .

Continuing the above example the dealerships may additionally what to target certain aspects of a user that make them a more desirable target where these aspects may be referred to as exclusivity characteristics and a relevancy matching of a user s exclusivity characteristics to the exclusive sponsored content may better ensure the effectiveness of the exclusive sponsored content on the user s preferences. For instance many of the dealerships may have sports car offerings and are willing to bid for access to users mobile communication facility which may be particularly effective in this instance because of the user profile that may be associated with buyer of high end sports cars. That is high income males who may be likely to utilize their mobile communications facilities in their decision making. Given this profile the dealership sponsors may want to bid based on exclusivity characteristics and in this case the relevancy of the user s exclusivity characteristics with high end sports cars such as a mobile subscriber characteristic specifying that the user is over a certain age a usage history that shows the user has been browsing for sports cars a location in some proximity to the dealership a mobile communication device characteristic that specifies the user has a mobile communication facility that has a large high resolution color display user transactions that indicate the user has significantly increased their spending profile and the like. In embodiments the dealership sponsors may offer bids that combine the bid amount exclusivity characteristics and relevancy in a plurality of ways in order to better utilize sponsorship dollars in the increase in car sales due to delivery of exclusive sponsored content.

In embodiments relevancy matching may be an important aspect in the effective delivery of exclusive sponsored content allowing the sponsored exclusive sponsored content to be better targeted to the intended audience. One way to better ensure relevancy to the user is to utilize mobile subscriber characteristic data associated with the user s mobile communication facility including user profile information demographic information billing information and the like. By using such information it may be possible to relevancy match exclusive sponsored content to personal attributes of the user such as their age address gender and the like. For instance advertising for clothing can be matched to the age gender and whether they live in an urban or rural setting. Advertisements for middle aged males may target sports cars home improvement and the like. Advertisements for young girls may target clothing and the like. Advertisements for seniors may target health products travel and the like. In embodiments information derived in association with mobile subscriber characteristic information may prove effective for matching the exclusive sponsored content to the user. In embodiments profile data such as age gender and address may be sufficient for an initial user relevancy matching of exclusive sponsored content.

In embodiments relevancy may be derived from a user transaction data associated with the mobile communication facility such as an online product purchase the filling of an online shopping cart an ad conversion and the like. For instance the user of the mobile communication facility may have just purchased some women s seasonal clothing. Now the user may not be interested in purchasing more seasonal clothing and so the relevancy for seasonal clothing may be significantly reduced as a result of the purchase but since the user is a woman and hasn t yet purchased any seasonal shoes the relevancy for shoes may be elevated as a result of the purchase. In another example a user may be purchasing new floor mats for a late model car which may indicate that the user has just purchased a late model car. As a result this may lower the relevancy for car ads but may elevate the relevance of car care products. In addition user transactions may be indicative of the user s interests and provide a better relevancy matching of the exclusive sponsored content to the user. In embodiments user transactions associated with the mobile communication facility may be effectively used in determining the user relevancy to exclusive sponsored content.

In embodiments relevancy may be derived from a usage history data associated with the mobile communication facility such as a browse history an ad conversion history from wireless carrier data and the like. For instance a user may be browsing for plasma televisions and as a result the relevancy for ads associated with plasma televisions as well as other similar products such as LCD televisions may be elevated. This elevation of relevance may become diminished over time if the browsing discontinues which may indicate that the user subsequently made the purchase. In another example a user may be browsing through the websites of college campuses and as a result may be targeted with exclusive sponsored content associated with colleges and college related consumer products such as laptop computers and the like. In embodiments usage history may also track ad conversion history as well as the types of ads that have been converted. For instance the user may be converting ads for mortgage rates and as a result the user may be targeted with exclusive sponsored content related to mortgage rates. Wireless carrier data may also be tracked and provide information that leads to increased relevancy matching. For instance the user may make a large number of calls from the financial district in New York City and result in an increased relevancy for ads relating to finances or the like. In embodiments usage history may be used to improve user relevancy in the selection of exclusive sponsored content.

In embodiments relevancy may be derived from mobile communication device characteristic data such as a display characteristic a computational characteristic a bandwidth characteristic a keypad characteristic and the like. For example a florist sponsor of colorful cut flowers may place a high relevancy on users with high end color displays a sponsor delivering interactive content may place a high relevancy on users with certain keyboards a sponsor delivering a detailed graphic may place a high relevancy on users with good processing capabilities and the like. In embodiments an exclusive sponsored content item bid may be higher based upon the relevancy of a mobile communication device characteristic.

In embodiments relevancy may be derived in association with location data. There may be a plurality of techniques in determining the location of a mobile communication facility such as by GPS by triangulation by triangulation utilizing Wi Fi and the like. The location of a mobile communications facility may be determined when a user enters a particular location may involve a plurality of geographic regions such as states cities and the like may be specified according to a distance from a specified location may be associated with some aspect of the mobile communications facility mobile content may be associated with a previous location or a current location and the like. For instance if a user of a mobile communications facility is at a location in proximity to a shopping area for clothing the relevancy for ads related to clothing may elevate. If a user is in proximity of a series of car dealerships the relevancy for car ads may elevate. In embodiments location data may be used to improve user relevancy to sponsored content.

Thus this type of webbrowsing activity may categorize this user in the Bride to Be category. This category may be stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database that is associated with her phone and sponsored content such as wedding related advertisements may be presented to the display of her mobile communication facility based at least in part that she fits the category of Bride to Be. 

Referring to in an embodiment a user of a mobile communication facility may access a content such as a webpage for viewing within the display of the mobile communication facility. In an example the content may exceed the capacity of the display to present the entire content within the display forcing the user of the mobile communication facility to first view a content portion and then navigate to view a content portion . The content portion may be associated with a contextual datum . The content portion may be associated with a contextual datum . Contextual datum and contextual datum may be stored in a contextual database. An association facility may be used to select from a sponsored content database a sponsored content that is associated with the contextual datum and a sponsored content that is associated with the contextual datum . The association between the contextual data and the sponsored content may be used to further associate the content portion with the sponsored content and the content portion with the sponsored content . During a display of content portion the content portion and its associated sponsored content may be displayed on the mobile communication facility simultaneously in temporal proximity to one another in a staged manner in a sequential presentation or in some other manner of display in which the content portion and the sponsored content are associated. During a display of content portion the content portion and its associated sponsored content may be displayed on the mobile communication facility simultaneously in temporal proximity to one another in a staged manner in a sequential presentation or in some other manner of display in which the content portion and the sponsored content are associated. In embodiments upon navigating to a content portion an indication of a stage change may be transmitted to a server associated with the mobile communication facility. The stage change may indicate a redirection to the portion. Once the redirection is registered it may be possible to glean a contextual datum that is associated with the portion. The process may be asynchronous in that the contextual data may be transmitted from the server in the background so that there is minimal interference with the function of the content portion viewed.

In embodiments an asynchronous process used for transmitting contextual data may be Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX or a similar process. AJAX refers to a cross platform technique that may be usable on different operating systems computer architectures and web browsers as it is based on open standards such as JavaScript and the DOM. The AJAX system is asynchronous in that extra data may be requested from a server and loaded in the background without interfering with the display and behavior of an existing page. JavaScript is a scripting language that may be used to make AJAX function calls. Data may be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object that may be available to scripting languages run in browsers or alternatively remote scripting in browsers that do not support XMLHttpRequest. In embodiments asynchronous content may be formatted in formats other than XML. AJAX and related techniques may exchange small amounts of data with a server as a background functionality so that entire web pages do not have to be reloaded each time there is a need to retrieve data from a server. This may increase a webpage s interactivity speed functionality and usability.

In embodiments a content portion may be displayed on a display on a mobile communication facility. The mobile communication facility may receive the entire content and then only display portions thereof as appropriate given the user s actions. For example the user may direct local software e.g. a browser on the mobile communication facility to connect to a specific webpage and the software may then retrieve the entire webpage or significant portion of the webpage. The mobile communication facility may then present a portion of the webpage to the display. For example the top of the webpage may be presented on the display and the software on the mobile communication facility may wait for indications from the user that the user wants to view another portion of the content. The indication may come as a zoom pan shift or other request from the user. The software on the mobile communication facility may monitor what portion is currently being displayed how long the portion is displayed or other parameters relating to the portion being displayed. The software on the mobile communication facility may then transmit this information to a server in real time such that other content related to the content portion being currently displayed can be transmitted to the mobile communication facility. The server side software may select appropriate content e.g. sponsored content related content etc. based on the content portion contextual information related to the content portion behavioral information based on how the user of the mobile communication facility interacts with the content portion or other such information. Once selected the server side software may communicate the content to the mobile communication facility. The mobile communication facility may be configured to accept such information or optionally configured to not accept such content. When the mobile communication facility receives the new content that relates to the currently displayed content portion the mobile communication facility may store the content for later presentation e.g. such as when the mobile communication facility gets brought to a certain location based on a time of day or based on some other later trigger event or implicit search . In other embodiments the mobile communication facility may present the newly selected content when it is received. The new content may be presented in coordination with the currently displayed content portion. For example the new content may be displayed within the same display section e.g. within the same window or it may be displayed separately e.g. in a separate window . AJAX may be one technology used to gain an understanding from the mobile communication facility as to which portion is currently being displayed. One skilled in the art would appreciate that no one software or protocol would be required to discover what content portion is currently being displayed or for communicating related information to the server based application. While many embodiments herein describe sending information to the server in real time relating to what content portions are being displayed it should be understood that such information may be collected and sent in batches at later points in time.

In other embodiments only a portion of the complete content may be communicated to the mobile communication facility and other content portions may be communicated to the mobile communication facility as requested. So in contrast to the example above where the majority of the content was delivered to the mobile communication facility and then a portion of the content was selected for presentation on the mobile communication display in this embodiment only a portion of the content is delivered to the mobile communication facility. Then other portions of the content can be later delivered. The other content portions may be later delivered in response to a user request e.g. such as through a pan or zoom request or through anticipation of what the user is going to want to view e.g. downloading other content portions through AJAX protocols . In this embodiment the sever program in charge of monitoring what portions are displayed on the mobile communication display may infer that certain portions are or have been displayed on the mobile communication facility because they have been delivered to the mobile communication facility. The server may track delivery of content portions based on type of request. For example a user explicit request may be tracked separately from an inference type request that is intended to anticipate what content the user may want to view. Related content selections may be based on any or all types of such content portion requests.

In embodiments content may be a text an image an audio an audio visual a webpage a section of a webpage a section of a screen a sponsored content an advertisement a portion of an advertisement an interactive feature a subscription content a tagged content a dynamic content or some other form of content.

In embodiments contextual data may be a link structure a link an outbound link an inbound link a keyword metadata or some other form of contextual data.

In an example a user of a mobile communication facility may access a content on the New York Times website. The home page of the New York Times website may contain more content than may be simultaneously presented to the display of the user s mobile communication facility. This may force the user to sequentially view portions of the website s content. In this example once the New York Times is first loaded to the mobile communication facility s display a content portion may be presented that consists of the main news headline of the day Fourth Quarter Foreclosures up 18 . This article including its headline and associated article text may be associated with a contextual datum that is stored in a contextual database. For example within the article there may be a reference to Fannie Mae in which the text Fannie Mae is an outbound link to Fannie Mae s website. In another example of contextual data that may be associated with the article a keyword or key word string such as housing housing starts mortgage etc. may be included in the article and these keywords may be stored as contextual data in the contextual database. The information regarding the contextual data associated with the viewed New York Times article portion may be used by an association facility to select a sponsored content from a sponsored content database that is associated with the article on display. Because the article concerns housing and housing finance an associated sponsored content may be an advertisement for a mortgage refinance company a debt management company a REIT investment opportunity and so forth. The associated sponsored content may then be displayed in conjunction with the New York Times portion . The presentation of the portion and sponsored content may be simultaneous in temporal proximity to one another staged in a sequential presentation or in some other manner of display in which the content portion and the sponsored content are associated.

Continuing the New York Times example after reading the article Fourth Quarter Foreclosures up 18 the user of the mobile communication facility may wish to view a portion of the same New York Times webpage presenting a sports article. To navigate to the sports article the user may scroll zoom or use some other navigational action to direct he sports article to display on the mobile communication facility. Upon navigating to the sports article an indication of a stage change may be transmitted to a server associated with the mobile communication facility. The stage change may indicate a redirection to the portion of the New York Times. Once the redirection to portion is registered it may be possible to glean a contextual datum that is associated with the portion . In this example the New York Times sports article may lead off with an item about a hockey team. The association facility may select from a sponsored content database a sponsored content that is associated with contextual data related to the hockey item such as keywords skates rink and or outbound links to specific NHL team webpages. For example a sponsored content may be an advertisement for an NHL team s apparel NHL ticket resellers and the like. The sponsored content may also be further associated with any of the other data associated with the mobile communication facility and or its user as described herein such as location. This may enable the sponsored content to be further targeted to the mobile communication facility user such as an advertisement for available skating rink times within a 5 mile vicinity of the billing address associated with the mobile communication facility or within 5 miles of the mobile communication facility s current location when viewing the sponsored content and so forth.

Referring to in an embodiment a user of a mobile communication facility may access a content such as a webpage for viewing within the display of the mobile communication facility. In an example the content may exceed the capacity of the display to present the entire content within the display forcing the user of the mobile communication facility to first view a content portion and then navigate to view a content portion . The content portion may be associated with a behavioral datum . The content portion may be associated with a behavioral datum . Behavioral datum and behavioral datum may be stored in a behavioral database. An association facility may be used to select from a sponsored content database a sponsored content that is associated with the behavioral datum and a sponsored content that is associated with the behavioral datum . The association between the behavioral data and the sponsored content may be used to further associate the content portion with the sponsored content and the content portion with the sponsored content . During a display of content portion the content portion and its associated sponsored content may be displayed on the mobile communication facility simultaneously in temporal proximity to one another in a staged manner in a sequential presentation or in some other manner of display in which the content portion and the sponsored content are associated. During a display of content portion the content portion and its associated sponsored content may be displayed on the mobile communication facility simultaneously in temporal proximity to one another in a staged manner in a sequential presentation or in some other manner of display in which the content portion and the sponsored content are associated.

In embodiments behavioral data may be panning zooming navigating scrolling positioning a page view a text view an image view streaming audio content streaming video content a download an upload a transaction an advertisement conversion receiving a text message sending a text message receiving an email sending an email entering a search query calling directory information or some other type of behavioral data. Behavioral data may be communicated to a server that is associated with the mobile communication facility in order to associate the behavioral data with the content that is delivered to the mobile communication facility in response to the receipt of the behavior. The content that is delivered to the mobile communication facility e.g. the page view may be used to calculate on the server which portion of a content a user is currently viewing.

Referring to in embodiments data relating to a portion of a content such as behavioral data that is stored in a behavioral database and or contextual data that is stored in a contextual database may be used to create or augment existing data about a mobile communication facility or its user. For example behavioral and contextual data relating to portions of content viewed on a mobile communication facility may be added to a usage history a device characteristics database a location database a mobile subscriber characteristics database a user transaction history database or a general contextual information database .

In embodiments mobile operators may create targeted on and off portal mobile advertising networks. In embodiments a mobile advertising network as described herein may be further associated with user privacy protocols or some other security protocol.

Referring to in embodiments a monetization platform as described herein may enable a unified multi screen ad server capable of handling a plurality of mobile advertising formats including but not limited to banners text audio video graphics multimedia or some other advertising format from a plurality of ad networks and or systems. As depicted in a monetization platform may be associated with a profile management platform PMP . In embodiments a monetization platform may be enabled to select and target advertising content that is available from across a plurality of advertising inventories. The selection and targeting of advertising content within the monetization platform may be based at least in part on a rules engine within the monetization platform. The selection and targeting of advertising content may be based at least in part on demographic data contextual data behavioral data or some other data type associated with a mobile user and or carrier.

Referring to in embodiments a monetization platform may be used to employ contextual and behavioral targeting techniques. In an embodiment the contextual and behavioral targeting techniques may be used to decipher the context of a page a user browses in order to display a targeted ad. In another embodiment the contextual and behavioral targeting techniques may be used to enhance a user profile. This may enable the building of robust user profiles. The search algorithms may enable crawling entity extraction query categorization or any other enrichment process in order to provide a contextual understanding of the page and to offer a precise page content understanding. In embodiments query stream analysis may be used in combination with term categorization to understand user interests over time as well as in precise moments in time to build behavioral profiles. The creation of behavioral profiles may increase the relevancy of mobile advertising.

In embodiments the monetization platform may serve as a centralized mobile advertising hub by partnering with mobile operators to balance mobile operator user and advertiser needs to deliver the mobile advertising while building traffic. The monetization platform may integrate multiple ad networks and servers via a single integration. A cross inventory selection process may dynamically select a relevant and profitable advertisement to display from the mobile advertising network and other integrated advertising networks.

In embodiments the monetization platform may integrate multiple ad networks and servers. A primary ad server may serve as the booking and delivery system for premium inventory to operator portal publisher web sites client applications or any other application. This may provide for direct sales of the operator s or publisher s high value inventory. Multiple ad networks may be integrated into the monetization platform and may be used to supplement direct sales activities. In embodiments the monetization platform may integrate with multiple local ad providers in multiple markets. In some embodiments operator publisher remnant or run of site inventory may also be made available to ad networks. In other embodiments a paid search system may be integrated with the monetization platform for searching and browsing inventory. The monetization platform s ad provider Application Programming Interface API may allow for easy integration of new ad providers without code releases.

In embodiments the optimization engine of the monetization platform may choose an appropriate ad for a given ad spot. The criteria that may be used for choosing the appropriate ad may be the type of ad and the ad provider targeted to the ad spot or some other criteria. The criteria may include business rules applied to the ad spot. The business rules may include setting a priority of ad providers keyword domain blacklists adult ad filtering weighting ad providers setting a default ad provider in case no ad is returned or any other business rule. The weighting of ad providers is done so that the ads are served in a designated allocation. In embodiments the monetization platform may use past user behavior and profile information to determine the ad provider and the ad that is valuable to serve.

In embodiments a yield optimization algorithm as described herein may determine which ad is relevant and revenue generating based on context WAP page consumer behavior expected ad revenue or some other characteristic.

In embodiments the profile management platform may place users who are anonymously tracked into one or more segments based on browsing search ad interaction purchase behavior or any some other user behavior. Profiles may also be enhanced with demographic information that may get loaded into a behavioral database. In embodiments operators or publishers may pass segment or other profile information at ad request time. The segment or profile information may be passed to the ad provider who may use it to serve a targeted ad.

In embodiments the monetization platform may be enabled to change ad behavior without changing ad tags. This may be done by using ad spots. Ad spots may be locations set up by the operator or publisher into which ads may be returned. Each ad spot setup may include the ad types and the ad providers that may be targeted to the given ad spot. Ad providers may be targeted to the given ad spot. The ad spot may also include business rules which may determine how ads are selected for the ad spot. Ad types ad providers and business rules may be changed in the monetization platform without modifying the publisher s ad request for an ad spot. This may ensure that operators and publishers may make changes to their ad spots without making changes to their site. The changes may be made through an administrative console and may take effect in real time.

In embodiments the monetization platform may provide operator and publisher access to the monetization platform. The monetization platform API may provide a programmatic interface for operators and publishers to retrieve multiple ad types. In embodiments the programmatic interface may report ad activity back to the monetization platform. Operators and publishers may need to integrate the ad tags once and may access the existing ad providers and new ad providers as they come online.

In embodiments the monetization platform may have an architecture including the monetization platform API monetization platform application servers an optimization engine a profile management platform a user interface and a publisher operator application server.

In embodiments the monetization platform API may allow publishers and mobile operators to request and retrieve ads as well as report ad activity back to the monetization platform. The monetization platform application servers may receive API requests pull the appropriate ads from various providers and return the results. The optimization engine may make the determination based on the most appropriate targeting and the available inventory. The determination may yield as to which ad providers to query and which ads to select for a given request. The profile management platform may collect search activity browsing behavior ad interaction and any explicitly stated demographic or profile information. This data may be passed with an ad request or enhanced by proprietary data sources. The monetization platform user interface may be an administrative interface for setting up business rules and weighting creating ad spots setting up new ad provider integrations profile administration and reporting.

In embodiments the monetization platform may retrieve ads from various sources and select the appropriate ad s to return based on business rules behavior targeting or some other criteria. The sources may include banner ad servers paid search ad systems ad networks and other third party ad providers. The integration of an ad provider with the monetization platform may shield operators and publishers from having to integrate with multiple ad providers.

In embodiments the publisher operator application server may request ads specific to its implementation. The publisher operator application server may place the ads on a mobile web page or in the client application. The placed ad may be viewed by a mobile subscriber.

In embodiments the monetization platform may leverage the profile management platform PMP to access user specific targeting information. The PMP may provide a robust and scalable architecture for the creation management and distribution of user profiles and behavioral based segmentation. The platform may integrate data from a large number of disparate data sources both internal and external to the PMP and or the operator itself. The PMP may include a series of enrichment modules that may leverage the monetization platform s unique understanding of mobile search and browse based behavior. This may allow the platform to extract meaning from search patterns and to categorize search and browse data at scale. The modules may process raw search and browse data and allow the monetization platform to enhance user profiles with additional information that may provide higher quality and granular user segmentation. The additional information may include relevant keywords.

In embodiments a user profile creation in the PMP may include data collection normalization enrichment warehousing and analysis.

In embodiments data collection may include accepting data into the system in both real time and batch. An example of data may be search data. The profile management platform may be able to integrate profiling data from any source. The sources may include search streams ad interactions browse activity operator CRM data and other third party data. In embodiments a search stream may include queries performed by a particular user a query timestamp and post query activity. The search stream data may provide insight into general user interest over time and illuminate immediate and evolving user needs. The search stream data may identify longer term and real time interests which may provide time sensitive targeting opportunities. The search data may be collected by the profile management platform via search deployments may be imported from external sources and may be deduced from gateway activity to capture off portal search activity. An example of base data collected analyzed and enriched by the profile management platform may be as follows A User ID may be collected which may be a Common Unique identifier. A Source may be collected which may be where the search was executed . Examples of locations where search may be executed are a portal a storefront and the like. A query may be collected which may be the keyword entered by the user. A URL may be collected which may be a URL clicked on a search result page. A location may be collected which may be a geographic location where the query was executed.

In embodiments an ad interaction as a source may include the profile management platform collecting data about a given user s interaction with both search and display advertising. The ad interaction data may allow the system to expand the knowledge of a user to include consideration for the type of advertising they are most likely to respond to. The information may be analyzed and provided as an element within the summarized user profile. An example of a base set of data collected by the profile management platform for ad interactions may be as follows A User ID may be collected which may be a Common Unique identifier. A provider may be collected which may be an advertisement source. Examples of an advertisement source may be a primary ad server. A context may be where the ad was displayed . Examples of context may be a sports portal a third party site and the like. An ad type may be details of the ad. Examples of ad details may be text static graphic interactive and the like. A timestamp may be the time the ad was displayed. A trigger may be What the ad was served in response to . Examples of a trigger may be search context behavior demographics and the like. An ad interaction may describe the ad success. Examples of an ad success may be click conversion and the like.

In embodiments browse activity as a source may include integrating both on portal and off portal browse data into the user profile. On portal brose behavior may be integrated via ad tags on the operator portal. Off portal browse behavior may be accessed via an integration with the operator gateway. The off portal browse behavior may be a unique operator asset that the PMP may analyze to improve the relevancy of the operator search experience and the yield of operator managed advertising. A key capability of the PMP may be its ability to analyze browse traffic to understand the content and nature of pages being visited. This may be done via an enrichment process.

In embodiments the operator CRM data and other third party data may include the PMP integrating operator specific CRM data e.g. demographics as well as existing segmentation data. The operator may pass explicit targeting information such as gender or age which may be used for targeting and also for enhancing the user profile. Integrating operator specific data may be supported by the base platform but may require professional services work for the actual integration as the nature and source of the imported data may be specific to each operator. When the monetization platform provides the search and or advertising solutions to the operator this data may be included in the profile process and no additional integration may be required. When the search and or advertising solution is not provided or in cases where additional operator specific data may be included e.g. gateway browse data demographics the PMP may provide both a real time web services API for data collection as well as a feed based batch process. The monetization platform may work with external data providers to determine the best method for data collection based on the quantity value and time sensitivity of the data to be collected.

In embodiments the PMP may include a number of modules to normalize the data collected from disparate data sources. In embodiments the PMP may rely on a common user ID to combine user data from different sources. In an example a common and reliable user ID may already exist. In some examples a hashed encrypted user ID may be available from some sources. The user ID normalization process may integrate an algorithm or algorithmic key for decoding user IDs and accessing the base user ID for compilation with other data sources. In embodiments the PMP may rely on having data time stamped in a known format and time zone. The timestamp normalization process may convert all inputs into an expected format and perform any time zone conversions based on knowledge of the data source. In some embodiments not all data from a given source may be provided to the PMP. In an example a sample of the gateway access data off portal browse activity may be provided. This knowledge e.g. 50 of random activity is provided may be incorporated into the raw data from the given source and may be used by the PMP analysis algorithms to improve the data weighting and the quality of the segmentation.

In embodiments enrichment may include performing value added processing of the collected data. The enrichment modules within the PMP may incorporate unique mobile user and mobile content understanding to improve the quality of the information included in the user profiles. Examples of the enrichment modules may include URL Categorization Entity Extraction Query Clustering Query Categorization Query Differentiation Blacklisting User Opt Out and Contextual Targeting Support or some other enrichment module.

In embodiments URL categorization may include the PMP leveraging the crawl search and categorization technology to understand the nature of the content being accessed by users. The PMP may maintain a database of URL classifications and an external service may enable new URLs entry into the database when an unknown site URL is provided as an input. This service may leverage the editorially constructed training sets and learning algorithms to automatically classify unknown URLs. The categorization metadata may then be included in the raw user behavior data and may be leveraged by the profile analysis algorithms to improve the user segmentation quality.

In embodiments entity extraction may include the PMP search algorithms analyzing accessed URLs content to determine the common entities e.g. names places in the page text. This information may be distilled and included in the raw user behavior data for analysis. This process may be extended to include sentiment analysis to determine the nature of the content related to the entity. In an example the user may frequently access information about certain kind of automobiles but a majority of the content may be negative about the automobiles. The entity extraction process may also be a valuable input into the keywords that are associated with a user profile.

In embodiments query clustering may include processing and summarizing of a user s query stream for analysis and inclusion into the user profile. The PMP may leverage the monetization platform s search experience and technology to provide advanced query analytics. The query clustering component may be responsible for grouping similar queries to allow for eventual categorization. The clustering component may rely on proven search tools to group similar terms and concepts based on historical analysis of millions of user searches. Spell correction technology may be used to correct queries prior to categorization.

In embodiments query categorization may include summarizing user searches into a set of defined query categories. The PMP may use advanced search technology to assign user queries to a defined set of categories. This process may use both an editorially defined training set for associating popular keywords to categories as well as a search based process that relies on URL categorization capabilities and access to a large scale web index. The two step process may take queries that are not editorially categorized and execute a search for them against a web index. The returned URLs may then be weighted and categorized to provide a category for the given query.

In embodiments query differentiation may include seeking to identify distinguishing terms from common and non distinguishing terms. Many queries may provide neither segmentation nor targeting value while other queries may provide insights in user behavior or a change in user behavior that presents a strong targeting opportunity. This knowledge may allow non distinguishing queries to be removed or down weighted from a user profile and allow more distinguishing queries to be weighted higher in the profile analysis.

In embodiments blacklisting may include an operator defining classes of content for which user behavior is not tracked. For example an operator may request that neither access to secure sites i.e. https nor access to adult sites be tracked and used in user profile creation. By default the monetization platform may exclude adult search terms and site access from profile creation.

In embodiments a user opt out may include the PMP supporting user level opt out from profiling. The PMP may accept in batch format a list of user IDs associated with users who may have opted out of behavioral targeting. In an embodiment based on the implementation and the specific market and or operator requirements the monetization platform may implement opt out requests to preclude all data associated to the given user ID from collection and storage in the data. In another embodiment the monetization platform may implement opt out request to allow data associated with the user ID to be collected and processed but not allow summarized user profiles to be created and distributed for the given user ID.

In embodiments contextual targeting support may include leveraging the data collected by the PMP by the contextual targeting engine within the monetization platform. The query clustering and query categorization data compiled by the PMP may be exported for use within the contextual analysis and yield optimization engine. Access to this data may allow the monetization platform to include keyword optimization as part of the yield algorithm for contextually targeted ads. For example if the contextual analysis engine determines that stock tips is the topic of a given page the keyword clustering and categorization data may be used to expand keywords considered by the yield optimization algorithm to include related keywords such as investment advice and trading strategies . This technology may allow the monetization platform contextual targeting process to select the highest yielding ad possible.

In embodiments warehousing includes the PMP leveraging a robust data warehouse built to provide real time on demand access. The platform may be built on the latest data warehousing technology. The platform may be a core component in the architecture providing both visibility and scalability. The data warehouse may be accessed by the user profile analyzer to create the summarized user profiles that are eventually made available to the monetization platform as well as other third party platforms. The data warehouse may enable summary level reports that provide insight into the archived data quality. An example of the metrics included in the reports may be Total Users Total number of users with data in the warehouse Profiled Users Total number of users with enough data to be placed in a segment Recency Histogram of profile recency i.e. when user data was last updated and Profile Depth Histogram of profile features e.g. segments keywords .

In embodiments analysis may include leveraging normalized cleansed and enriched raw data from the previous steps to create a consumable user profile. The analysis portion of the PMP may include two general components. The first component may allow segments to be defined within the PMP and the second component may be the actual analysis module which performs the computational steps required to generate the user profile. The segment component may allow for definition of N number of top level user segments e.g. Music Sports and N number of secondary level segments e.g. Pop Football .

Name and Description The segment name may be exposed to services that consume the profile as well as a segment marketing description.

Action weightings Action weightings may be configurations that may define the relative importance of different user behaviors e.g. click browse search in determining if a given user should be associated with the segment.

Category relationships Category relationships may define the affinity level between the browse URL and search query categories and the given segment.

Time Sensitivity Time sensitivity may define the general decay curve for how quickly historic raw user data may be discounted when determining scoring for the given segment. The ability may exist to create a window of time for which the raw user data may be given an inflated weighting in the overall segment scoring. This may allow the PMP to define segments which may be extremely sensitive to changes in user behavior and may be quickly associated with a given user in order to take advantage of limited duration changes in user behavior e.g. vacation shopper .

Confidence Minimum Confidence minimum may be the minimum correlation level with user behavior that is achieved in order to associate the segment with a given user.

In embodiments the PMP may support a large number of segments. A balance between segmentation and reach may be maintained. The monetization platform may work with the operator to achieve the proper balance between segment granularity targeting segment reach traffic and available advertisers coverage . The PMP s dual level segmentation capabilities may allow for more granular segments to be experimented with while the top level segmentation remains intact for targeting and ad delivery.

In embodiments the PMP profile creation may be responsible for analyzing the user level raw data and performing the following tasks Segment Assignment Keyword Assignment and Metadata Assignment.

In embodiments segment assignment may be based on the segment definitions the analysis module scoring users may be based on segment definitions and associates users to zero or more segments along with a confidence score. The segment assignment process may be configured to run at a periodic basis as required by the operator and or the change rate of the underlying raw data. The segment assignment process may be configurable to analyze different users behavior on a different schedule than other users e.g. the segment analysis for more active users can be done more frequently .

In embodiments a keyword assignment process may include analyzing the user level raw data to associate a configurable number of keywords keyphrases to specific user profiles along with a confidence score. The keyword assignment may be based on the analysis done during the enrichment portion of the data collection process and the final analysis and rollup may be done during the keyword assignment phase. The keyword assignment process may be configured to run at a periodic basis as required by the operator and or the change rate of the underlying raw data. The keyword assignment process may be configurable to analyze different users behavior on a different schedule than other users e.g. the segment analysis for more active users may be done more frequently .

In embodiments metadata assignment may include the analysis and rollup of data not associated with a segment or keyword. The profile features considered may include location operator or third party provided demographics and user specific ad interaction rates across data sources.

In embodiments the PMP user profile definition may result in discrete user profiles that may be accessed. The user profile characteristics may include User ID Encrypted version only passed with batch profile delivery Top Level Segment s The 0 to many top level segments associated with a profile Secondary Segment s The 0 to many secondary segments associated with a profile Segment Strength A numeric score that may represent the correlation to the segment Keyword s The 0 to many keywords key phrases associated with the profile Keyword Strength A numeric score that may represent the correlation to the keyword Emergent Segment A segment not currently associated with the user but that recent behavior may have suggested may be assigned in the near future Ad Interaction Summarized interaction rates for text display and interactive Demographics Operator or third party provided demographics e.g. age gender Estimated Demographics Demographic data derived by the PMP based on analysis of the user behavior Billing Location Operator provided billing location and Predominant Location Home location based on analysis of user location when interacting with the external systems e.g. search .

In embodiments the PMP may provide a comprehensive security layer and multiple access methods for sharing user profiles with the monetization platform and operator designated third parties.

In embodiments the PMP may support two levels of access restrictions. The API access restrictions may include exposing user profiles via a real time web services API as well as a batch orientated and feed based scheduler mechanism. Access to these services may be restricted based on IP restrictions and authorization key. In embodiments a pre defined list of allowed IPs may access the PMP user profile service. The list of IPs may be provided prior to system use. A valid authorization key may be passed as part of the profile request. Authorization keys may be unique based on the requesting IP and may be updated on a frequent interval. An authorization key may be used to map the request to an account to determine profile level restrictions.

In embodiments for a given account the PMP may support the notion of profile level restrictions. Profile level restrictions may define the set of user profile features that a given account may access. For example an account may be created that may provide access to top level segments and keywords while other accounts may be created that may allow full access to features included in the user profile. This may allow the PMP to share user profile data at the level required by the requesting party and provide a mechanism for the operator to offer differing levels of service targeting to third party consumers of the profiles.

In embodiments the PMP may support both a real time web service API as well as a file based batch delivery mechanism. The web services API may require that a valid user ID and authorization key be passed to the system. Once the authorization key is validated based on the requesting IP the PMP may look up the user profile for the given user ID. The corresponding user profile may then be retrieved and the allowed profile features for the given account may be returned. The PMP may support batch based delivery of a large number of user profiles. This service may require additional professional services work to ensure that only encrypted user IDs are made available to the third party accessing the user profiles and that the third party has a valid mechanism and secure process for managing user IDs within their environment. In addition operator approval may be required before any batch delivery of user profiles is done.

In embodiments to allow for forecasting and targeting by segment the monetization platform may pass the subscriber segment information to the ad providers that accept it. When an ad request comes in from an operator the segment information may be automatically passed to the appropriate ad providers. This may allow for campaigns targeted to those segments to be retrieved as well as allow for forecasting by segment for the ad providers who support it.

Ad server The monetization platform may passes the subscriber segment using the keyname value functionality in an ad server along with an ad request. Ads targeted to the segment s that may be passed in are then returned. If there are no ads targeted to the segment s passed in untargeted ads may be returned. The same holds true for demographic data passed in with the ad request. An ad server may use the data in the keyname value pair to build an inventory forecast for each segment. Forecasts may also be run for combinations of segments or combinations of segments with demographic or other operator supplied information.

Paid Search A keyword associated with the subscriber segment or the page context may be passed to a paid search system. If there are any ads targeted to the keyword they may be returned. For ads displayed with results triggered by a user search the specific search keyword may be passed to paid search and matching ads may be returned.

Other ad providers For other ad providers who may support targeting the monetization platform may pass segment or other subscriber information as parameters to an ad request if the ad provider supports this functionality. This may be set up during the implementation of a new ad provider.

In embodiments targeting of advertising content may include integrating the targeting capabilities of the monetization platform with leading ad providers. Targeting campaigns to segments or other subscriber information may be dependent on the capabilities of the ad provider.

Ad server If segment and or subscriber information targeting is desired for a particular campaign this may be done by using the search term wizard within an ad server. The search term wizard may allow the campaign manager to create an expression to target a particular campaign to a combination of segments and subscriber information.

In embodiments the monetization platform may utilize all levels of targeting exposed via an ad server API. This may include use of the keyname and keyvalue pairs to create campaigns targeted to segments and or demographics ability to pass a keyword to the ad server for targeting. The monetization platform may be configured to pass either the actual user query segment names segment level keywords as defined by the PMP or profile level keywords as defined by the PMP as part of the ad request. Targeting may include the ability to pass a zip code to the ad server. The monetization platform may be configured to pass either the user s current physical location based on a location based services integration the actual user input value if when available or a known location from the user profile.

In embodiments the monetization platform may leverage location targeting capabilities for the delivery of location specific pay per call ads. This may include the ability to pass a location to the ad server for targeting. The monetization platform may be configured to pass either the user s current physical location e.g. based on location based services integration the actual user input value or a known location from the user profile or some other location information.

In embodiments the monetization platform may be able to integrate to a third party ad provider for the delivery of targeted advertising. The degree of targeting may be limited by the third party API and or ad serving capabilities. An optimized integration may be provided that leverages the full capabilities of the third party ad delivery system.

In embodiments the monetization platform may support the following ad types sponsored links banner ads rich media audio video promotions or any other ad type. The monetization platform may support linking directly to an advertiser mobile web site or to a client application hosted landing page. The supported landing pages for sponsored links and promotions may be phone call launch SMS landing page marketing message email capture local listing and the like.

In embodiments sponsored links may be ads placed on search result pages as a result of a user search query. The user intent may be derived directly from the query and location targeting information included on the ad search request as well as past user behavior. In embodiments advertisers may create and target ads and bid on relevant keywords so that their ads may appear in response to requests for sponsored links.

In embodiments banners may be displayed during a mobile subscriber s browsing experience on a publisher site.

In embodiments the monetization platform may be integrated with several ad networks. There may be two or more mechanisms to integrate with an ad network. One mechanism may be an API integration in which the monetization platform invokes a web service hosted by the ad network. Alternately the market place may be synchronized out of the ad network and into the monetization platform.

In embodiments an ad server may provide an API that may be used for ad content ingestion metadata management content cataloguing and creative management.

In embodiments the monetization platform may be integrated with a relevance engine. In embodiments a custom integration may consist of defining data that is passed from the relevance engine and the rules that should be applied for segmentation. Targeting and ad serving may also need to be defined. To the extent that data from the CRM system may be used to generate profiles a data format for the data to be supplied to the monetization platform may need to be defined. For the ad server integration with many of these systems may use of an ad server API which may be used to set up entities within the system including campaigns and creatives. It may also be used to retrieve campaign delivery and billing information to be integrated with billing systems. Integration with external ad stores may be accomplished by placing a reference to the hosted creative within an ad server or through the built in ability to push data to a content delivery network.

In embodiments an ad server may allow clients to implement their natural taxonomy as the basis for the metadata used for ad management including targeting and reporting . The required metadata for each ad request may include but is not limited to 

Ad site a virtual label applied by client commonly used to describe the content. It may be more specific or more general i.e. Section Channel Network Sub section Page Widget Newsletter etc. It may be included or excluded from any campaign target.

Position List May Request up to 126 Positions commonly used to indicate Ad Zone Placement Length Size and or Type. Campaigns Ads are assigned to Position s in an ad server UI.

Custom Keywords May pass up client defined name value pairs with each ad request. As depicted in these custom keywords may be included excluded or used to build Boolean targeting expressions for each ad campaign.

Cookies Cookies in the client s domain may be targetable via Boolean expressions. An ad server may also has access to standard HTTP headers such as Date and User Agent and these are available for targeting inclusion exclusion in each campaign. Reporting may be available on metadata as well.

In embodiments profile management and ad targeting may be based on profiles comprised of data including but not limited to 1 demographic information provided by the operator 2 behavioral indicators provided by the operator 3 processing raw data from the operator e.g. click history search history SMS call data 4 on portal search services provided to the operator where such queries may be normalized enriched and categorized 5 on portal click history determined via ad tags 6 off portal behavior determined via relationship directly with publishers which may include behavioral profile information provided by the publisher or determined based on search history or browsing revealed via ad tags 7 previous and current location based information or some other profile data. Data may be provided captured and used in batch or real time. In embodiments a user s clicks may be correlated with the contextual information of a page e.g. webpage based at least in part on search algorithms e.g. word frequency link analysis .

In embodiments advertising for non web mobile traffic e.g. SMS MMS in game in application video TV voice e.g. during directory assistance call or a call to vote in a television or radio program or some other type of content based at least in part on contextual and behavioral data as described herein.

In embodiments contextual targeting of pay per click ads may be based on the content of an SMS MMS in game data in application data video TV voice or some other type of content.

In embodiments a behavioral profile may be used for syndication of content including advertisement content. In an example a third party publisher e.g. a party other than an operator or a third party ad network may request behavioral profile information to facilitate the delivery of a targeted ad for a third party publisher other than the operator. A behavioral profile may be returned that is developed in conjunction with an operator. In embodiments this application may describe access rights to components of the behavioral profile. The application may also include obfuscation hashing a time limited ID or some other method of limiting the permitted access to the profile data.

In embodiments an operator may receive revenue for profile data in the form of a flat fee revenue share or some other revenue metric against the advertising.

In embodiments the importance of information within profile may be weighted e.g. demographic vs. behavioral data .

In embodiments a behavioral profile may be aggregated. In an example a publisher may request an ad the monetization platform may determine which operator the user is requesting the content from and may pull the behavioral profile for the associated network and return the associated behavioral profile information.

In embodiments multiple ad inventories may be managed for the monetization of mobile traffic. In an example a publisher and or operator may select an event that they wish to monetize. They may request an ad from the monetization platform which then determines from which inventory an ad should come. The distribution of ad inventory may occur across multiple ad networks and or ad servers. The determination of which inventory from which to select an ad may include weighting i.e. percentage allocation backfill i.e. try A then B then C blending i.e. sort multiple ads for delivery in one event based on bid price relevance yield or other yield i.e. MP can query an ad provider server for an ad compare the pricing to ads from other servers and determiner expected yield based on correlating the ad with the behavioral profile or some other method. Such rules may be targeted to a single ad spot or applied across multiple ad spots. As depicted in and the creation and management of a ad spots ad types and ad providers may be associated with a user interface of the monetization platform. The system may also re balance after a change is made to reserve inventory for a particular campaign.

In embodiments personalization and or content recommendation technologies may be enable in order to access behavioral profiles for the purposes of content delivery.

In embodiments a monetization platform may include handset management across multiple ad networks and servers when managing multiple ad inventories for the monetization of mobile traffic. In an example a centralized handset database with makes models and capabilities may be used. When an ad is requested the handset and capabilities may be provided to the ad networks and servers for targeting purposes and the right ad selection e.g. small medium or large . In an embodiments the monetization platform may provide exception management where one carrier publisher can change the ad type size data provided to ad networks servers for a particular handset which may be different than all other carriers are using. The make and model of a handset may be determined based on the webpage request e.g. user agent string in the WAP header a client application that can query the handset directly the carrier user handset database or some other criterion. This system may allow for mobile enabling of non mobile ad serving technologies e.g. for publishers wanting to continue using the same campaign management and reporting tools .

In embodiments mobile behavioral data may be used within a monetization platform for targeting ads on non mobile media e.g. computer TV settop box etc. . In embodiments methods and systems of the monetization platform as described herein may be used to identify the mobile user on other non mobile media for example including but not limited to phone detection from the TV set top box and categorizing the viewed content dropping a cookie to continue tracking the computer when it s accessing the Internet away from the home or some other method.

In embodiments in the monetization platform advertisers may be allowed to bid in a mobile pay per click marketplace based at least in part on behavioral profile data.

In embodiments the monetization platform may use contextual targeting of an ad including using search algorithms e.g. word frequency link analysis and other methods to contextually target display advertising. In embodiments this information may be combined with other information relating to a mobile communication facility and or its user as described herein.

In embodiments ad targeting may be based on a categorized location. Categorized locations may include home work in market out of market and may be based at least in part on location history data that is associated with a mobile communication facility. Categorized locations may be provided based at least in part by logs of calls SMS or other activities that include a cellphone tower ID or some other location detection technology that may be correlated with a geographic region.

In embodiments gateway data or other operator data e.g. click history through a transcoder may be use to modify a link authority algorithm. In embodiments the historical usage of links within a network may be able to improve link analysis and quality detection.

In embodiments search from a mobile communication facility may be based at least in part on a contextual search e.g. where a user is searching form and contextual suggestions e.g. from SMS browser contact list etc. 

In embodiments search may be based on a categorized location. Categorized locations may include home work in market out of market or some other category of location. Home and work locations may be determined without demographic data being provided based for example on historical location information provided by the network. Categorized locations may be provided based at least in part by logs of calls SMS or other activities that include a cell phone tower ID or some other location detection technology that may be correlated with a geographic region.

A rules engine may be applied to secondary change data that is data that comes from one or more data sources and that indicates that a change may be required in a data set or to inference data that is data derived by inferences from one or more data sets. For example a rule may indicate that a change in a data set will be made if a secondary data source confirms an inference or if an inference is consistent with data indicated by a data source. Similarly a rule might require multiple confirmations such as requiring more than one data source or more than one inference before confirming a change to a data set or creation of a new feature or attribute in the data set . Rules may require any fixed number of confirmations whether by other data sets or by inferences derived from those data sets. Rules may also embody various processes or work flows such as requiring a particular person or entity to approve a change of a given type or a change to a particular type of data.

In embodiments data integration techniques and methods may be used to extract information from a plurality of mobile data sources the data sources having a plurality of distinct data types storing the data in a common data set considering a change request associated with a database such as a database that is associated with a monetization platform and using the common data set to validate the change request.

In embodiments a data integration facility may provide a rule hierarchy to determine a data type to use in a data set related to a system such as a monetization platform the rule hierarchy applying a rule based on at least one of a data item the richness of a data item the reliability of a data item the freshness of a data item and the source of a data item and representing the rule hierarchy in a data integration rule matrix wherein the matrix facilitates the application of a different rule hierarchy to a different type of data.

In embodiments a data integration facility may be used to integrate data from a plurality of mobile data sources taking an inference drawn from analysis of data collected by a data sources applying a data integration rule matrix to determine the extent to which to apply the inference and updating a data set based on the application of the rule.

A data integration facility may be used in association with a system such as a monetization platform to iteratively collect and make inferences about data that is collected for use in the monetization platform. Iteration may be performed a plurality of times or continuously as an on going process to collect and make inferences about data attributes. Iteration may be a function of the entire data set e.g. an entire usage history of a user all ad conversion data related to a content and the like or a function of specific data segments e.g. usage history 

The data integration facility may include at least one of a bridge a message broker a queue and a connector. Therefore a useful data source may be associated with a data integration facility via computer code hardware or both that establishes a connection between the source and the data integration facility. For example the bridge may include code that takes data in a native data type such as data in a mark up language format extracts the relevant portion of the data and transforms the data into a different format such as a format suitable for storing the data for use in a monetization platform e.g. as an attribute or metadata associated with user data content data wireless operator data publisher data and the like . The message broker may extract data from a data source e.g. a wireless operator place the data in a queue or storage location for delivery to a target location e.g. monetization platform server and deliver the data at an appropriate time and in an appropriate format for the target location. In embodiments the target location may be a monetization platform database a data mart a metadata facility or a facility for storing or associating an attribute within a monetization platform. The connector may comprise an application programming interface or other code suitable to connect source and target data facilities with or without an intermediate facility such as a data mart or a data bag. The connector may for example include AJAX code a SOAP connector a Java connector a WSDL connector or the like.

In embodiments the data integration facility may be used to integrate data from a plurality of data sources the data sources including attributes relevant to for example a monetization platform. The data integration facility may include a syndication facility. The syndication facility may publish information in a suitable format for further use by computers services or the like such as in aid of creating updating or maintaining a monetization platform database such as one related to user behavioral profiles publishers or some other type of data used by the monetization platform as described herein. For example the syndication facility may publish relevant data in RSS XML OPML or similar format such as user data wireless operator data ad conversion data publisher data and many other types of information that may be used by the monetization platform. The syndication facility may be configured by the data integration facility to feed data directly to a monetization platform database such as a user profile database in order to populate relevant fields of the database with data to populate attributes of the database to populate metadata in the database or the like. In embodiments the syndicated data may be used in conjunction with a rules engine such as to assist in various inferencing processes to assist in confirming other data or the like.

In embodiments the data integration facility may include a services oriented architecture facility. In the services oriented architecture facility one or more data integration steps may be deployed as a service that is accessible to various computers and services including services that assist in the development updating and maintenance of a monetization platform database such as a user profile database or the like.

Services may be published in a registry with information about how to access the services so that various data integration facilities may use the services. Access may be APIs connectors or the like such as using Web Services Definition Language enterprise Java beans or various other codes suitable for managing data integration in a services oriented architecture.

In embodiments the data integration facility may include at least one of a spidering facility a web crawler a clustering facility a scraping facility and a filtering facility. The spidering facility or other similar facility may thus search for data such as available from various domains services wireless operators publishers and sources available on the Internet or other networks extract the data such as by scraping or clustering data that appears to be of a suitable type filter the data based on various filters and deliver the data such as to a target monetization platform database. Thus by spidering relevant data sources the data integration facility may find relevant data such as user behavioral data contextual data relating to content publisher data and many other types of the types variously described herein of information. The relevant data may be used to draw inferences to support inferences to contradict inferences or the like with the inference engine such as to assist in creation maintenance or updating of a monetization platform database. The data may also be used to populate data fields directly to populate attributes associated with data items or provide metadata.

In embodiments statistical analysis techniques such as liner regression logistic regression decision tree analysis Bayes techniques including na ve Bayes K nearest neighbors analysis collaborative filtering data mining and other techniques may be used as part of the monetization platform to model filter and determine relevancies from among wireless operator data data relating to a mobile communication facility and its user ad network data publisher data or some other type of data used within the monetization platform. For example linear regression analysis may be used to determine the relationship between one or more independent variables such as mobile subscriber characteristics and another dependent variable such as an ad conversion modeled by a least squares function called a linear regression equation. This function is a linear combination of one or more model parameters called regression coefficients. The monetization platform data may consist of n values x . . . xfor each of the m independent variables explanatory variables x i 1 . . . m and n values y . . . yof the dependent variable y response variable . The independent variables may also be called regressors exogenous variables covariates input variables or predictor variables. In general there are m parameters to be determined . . . . The model is a linear combination of these parameters 

Here X includes typically a constant that is a column which does not vary across observations and the independent variables or functions of the independent variables. denotes the error term. Models used within the monetization platform that do not conform to this specification may be treated by nonlinear regression and or other statistical techniques.

A linear regression model need not be a linear function of the independent variable linear in this context means that the conditional mean of y is linear in the parameters . For example the model y x x is linear in the parameters and but it is not linear in x as X x a nonlinear function of x.

A formulation of simple linear regression that explicitly shows the linear regression as a model of conditional expectation can be given as 

The conditional distribution of y given x is a linear transformation of the distribution of the error term.

In another example Bayes theorem may be used to analyze monetization platform data such as wireless operator data data relating to a mobile communication facility and its user ad network data publisher data or some other type of data used within the monetization platform. Bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events A and B where B has a non vanishing probability 

Using Bayes thereom conditional probabilities may be assigned to for example mobile communication facility user profile variables where the probabilities estimate the likelihood of an ad conversion and are based at least in part on prior observations of the users interactions with mobile content.

Na ve Bayes classifiers may also be used to analyze monetization platform data such as wireless operator data data relating to a mobile communication facility and its user ad network data publisher data or some other type of data used within the monetization platform. A naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes theorem with strong naive independence assumptions. A naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence or lack of presence of a particular feature of a class is unrelated to the presence or lack of presence of any other feature. For example a mobile communication facility user may be classified in a user profile as a sports fan if he has visited a sports related website purchased a sporting event ticket and uses a college football team fight song as his ringtone. A Bayes classifier considers all of these properties to independently contribute to the probability that this user is a sports fan. Once a classification is assigned within the user profile e.g. User X sportsfan the user s information may be stored and shared by the monetization platform e.g. sending the data to an ad server where the classification sports fan may be used to select sports related sponsored content to deliver to the user s mobile communication facility . A single user profile may include a plurality of classifiers. For example the sports fan s user profile may also include classifiers indicating that the user is an international traveler or a horticulturalist and so forth using the stream of wireless data that is associated with the user s mobile communication facility the wireless account data behavioral data relating to the user contextual data relating to the content and applications accessed on the user s mobile communication facility and any other data sources as described herein. An advantage of the naive Bayes classifier is that it requires a small amount of training data to estimate the parameters means and variances of the variables necessary for classification. Because independent variables are assumed only the variances of the variables for each class need to be determined and not the entire covariance matrix. This characteristic of na ve Bayes may enable the classification

In embodiments a behavioral data analysis algorithm may be used for developing behavioral profiles for mobile communication facility users. Behavioral profiles may then be used for targeting advertisements and other content to the users mobile communication facilities. A behavioral profile may include a summary of a user s activity on a mobile communication facility including the types of content and applications accessed and other behavioral properties. The user s activity summary may include searches browses purchases clicks impressions with no response or some other activity as described herein. The behavioral properties may be summarized as continuous interest scores of a content category. Continuous frequency scores and continuous recency scores e.g. how recently the activity occurred may be considered as behavioral properties for use in constructing a behavioral profile. A user s activity summary and the behavioral properties may be categorized using the analytic techniques as described herein e.g. na ve Bayes classifiers .

Content data including sponsored content and its characteristics may also be used for the generation of a behavioral profile. For example data such as advertisement identity ad tag user identity advertisement spot identity date and user response for each impression may be used. In addition content categories may be used for targeting each advertisement based on a behavioral profile or portion of a behavioral profile. Further content categories may be associated with each search browse purchase or other online behavioral and or transaction.

In embodiments an algorithm may be implemented to assess the behavior profile associated with a mobile communication facility user. Algorithm parameters may be calculated by using different formulae as in the example embodiment listed below 

The algorithm for the generation of a behavioral profile may be simplified by keeping the same activity factors for a plurality of content categories in a plurality of situations. In addition it may be simplified further by keeping the same history factor for similar activities content categories and situations.

In embodiments a user behavior or activity may be analyzed in relation to a particular content content type content category and so forth. In an example an activity factor may be learned based at least in part on logistic regression methodology. Realtime mobile traffic data may be associated with a user profile including a historical user profile that includes prior activities behaviors and the like. Data derived from the updated request profile may be used in a responsiveness model based on logistic regression or some other statistical modeling methodology . For example independent variables of a logistic responsiveness model may account for content categories and the like in order to predict a dependent variable such as a user activity or response. This type of responsiveness model may be used for success estimation where success estimation is a stated target activity or response such as an ad conversion a click through a user transaction following click through on advertisement content or some other type of response. As shown in this type of responsiveness model may be iteratively updated and the model adapted as new data user behaviors content types and the like are added to the user profile and data model.

In embodiments the selection of a relevant advertisement may be based at least in part on the results of a responsiveness model as described herein.

In embodiments a responsiveness model may be built for each user each content or some aggregation of a plurality or users and or content. When content is requested for example by a publisher the responsiveness model and its analytic results may be used to estimate the relative responsiveness for each advertisement by users on the basis of their user profile and a selection of which relevant content to ultimately present to the user may be based on the responsiveness model results.

In embodiments responsiveness modeling may determine a success estimation parameter based at least in part on an increase in a click through ratio or click through ratio rise. User profile characteristics and behaviors may be used in the responsiveness model to predict a response outcome such as a click through and the model optimized to select those user profile characteristics that are most associated with the wanted response of a clickthrough. Other users that have the same or similar user profile characteristics may be targeted for receiving the advertisements in the future. Once the new recipients activities in response to the advertisements are known the responsiveness model may be recalculated using this new data and revised success estimates generated.

All of the elements of the system may be operatively coupled as shown. These operative couplings may include any and all suitable communications channels including without limitation wireless and or wired communications channels. The information flowing over the operative couplings may include sponsored content analytic output interaction data or the like as respectively indicated by solid dashed or dotted lines.

In another example a navigation application may be associated with application contextual data including but not limited to geographic coordinates corresponding to a location of a mobile communication facility a data inquiry made within the navigation application by a user e.g. where is the nearest gas station a user saving a location as a favorite the entering of an address to navigate to the downloading of a navigation guide s voice file the purchase of a map layer or some other type of navigation application data. In another example a gaming application may be associated with application contextual data including but not limited to a game purchase a time and or duration of game play within the application a keystroke combination mistake made more than once by a user during game play or some other type of gaming application data.

Content contextual data may include an ad tag a file type a file size resolution duration popularity ranking usage history cost publisher rating ranking genre participant information e.g. actor artist musician music label participant product code a semantic relationship of keywords within the content a link structure an inbound link an outbound link a text a keyword metadata or some other type of contextual information. Metadata may include information relating to an origin of content. Metadata may describe a portion of a content that is currently on display within an application running on a mobile communication facility. Metadata may be discovered by text voice recognition image recognition or some other means of discovery.

In embodiments a wireless carrier may receive mobile traffic data indicating that a user is currently using a media player to view a video on his mobile communication facility. The application contextual data relating to the application in use may include data indicating the brand or type of media player in use the duration of use contextual data relating to how the video player is being used e.g. what video is being played what volume level is used the duration of viewing the video and so forth . The content contextual data relating to content within the application may include a video content s publisher a genre of media being played products placed within the media content or some other data relating to the content on display within the application. This application contextual data and the content contextual data may be further associated with information relating to the mobile communication facility the user and or the wireless network as described herein.

The interactions may take place within a context. For example and without limitation the context may include a time date or location contextual information encoded in a metadata tag or the like that is associated with the application content and so on demographic geographic or other information which may be associated with the user past or present behaviors or interactions of the user external or third party information relating to the user the application the content the publisher and on and so forth.

The application content or other information may be provided by or associated with a publisher. For example and without limitation the publisher may include an original producer a distributor a re distributor a retailer a wholesaler and so on. A variety of kinds of publisher will be understood.

Thus the data stored by the interaction database may include data about the application content context publisher and so on.

The analytics facility may from time to time receive from the interaction database any and all of the data stored therein. To this data the analytics facility may apply data integration statistical analysis data mining stream analysis or some other type of data processing or analytic technique as described herein. In embodiments these techniques may be directed at selecting or suggesting sponsored content to be delivered to the user. Additionally or alternatively these techniques may be directed at generating information related to the selecting or suggesting of sponsored content to be delivered to the user.

Referring to behavioral profile syndication may include a wireless operator receiving user related behavioral data from a mobile communication facility and then providing the information or some derivative of the information to a third party for consideration in the form of revenue sharing. The wireless operator may also provide the user behavioral data to be stored in a behavioral dataset in a behavioral database . Third party data relating to the user or the mobile communication facility may be included with or accessible in association with the behavioral database . Processing of the behavioral and or third party data may include a data integration step as described herein elsewhere to facilitate the cleansing formatting and integration of the disparate data into a useable form. The data in the behavioral database may be analyzed such as through statistical analysis data mining stream analysis as described herein. The analysis results may also be stored in or accessible through the behavioral database . A monetization platform server may access the behavioral database the analytics the third party data and the like. An ad server such as an ad server associated with an ad network may issue a request for behavioral data from the monetization platform server . In response to this request the monetization platform server may deliver to the ad server behavioral data that is based on a relevance with the request. The ad server may interface to an ad network that may be a performance based ad network that may include a bidding platform. The bidding platform may facilitate advertisers associated with the ad network bidding for access to behavioral data. The advertisers may bid for the right to submit a request for the behavioral data the right to access delivered behavioral data and the like. The ad server may also interface with publishers such as content publishers to facilitate forming requests for behavioral data and the like.

In embodiments a monetization platform may be used to receive analyze select aggregate and deliver behavioral data and other data that may be associated with wireless subscribers to an ad server publisher or some other party that may use the data for a commercial purpose e.g. targeting mobile content for display to mobile communication facilities . Datasets used by the monetization platform may come from a plurality of sources such as a wireless operator publisher or a third party source e.g. a commercial consumer database . In embodiments the monetization platform may associate other data metadata or business rules with the user behavioral data including but not limited to an availability condition access grant financial consideration or some other type of conditional grant of use. The grant of use to the behavioral or other type of data may be conditionally determined by the monetization platform wireless operator or some third party e.g. such as a commercial dataset that may be used to enrich behavioral data within the monetization platform but carries terms of use specified by the commercial dataset provider . In embodiments the conditional grant to use the data that is delivered by the monetization platform may be based on a financial consideration that is shared exchanged and or transacted between the parties such as a wireless operator ad network publisher or some other third party and is based at least in part on access and or use of the data. In other cases the conditional grant may be based on a time period for use or based on other considerations.

In embodiments the wireless operator data behavioral data and other data e.g. demographic or geographic data relating to a user of a mobile communication facility may be accessible to a third party e.g. an ad network publisher or some other content provider through the monetization platform server. The monetization platform server may receive ad network requests publisher requests operator requests or some other third party requests for mobile subscriber data e.g. a wireless user behavioral profile demographic profile geographic profile or some other type of user data . As a condition for allowing access to the data the monetization platform may require that a financial consideration be provided by or on behalf of the requesting ad network publisher wireless operator or some other party. The financial consideration may be a flat fee a fixed amount variable amount impression based e.g. cost per thousand impression or CPM cost per click CPC cost per action CPA time based based on a shared revenue of user transactions shared with a wireless operator whose data is being accessed shared with a publisher shared with an ad network or otherwise arranged.

In embodiments the data that may be accessed by the ad network ad server publisher or third party may be stored separate from the wireless operator or other party from which the data derives such as in a behavioral dataset associated with the monetization platform. The monetization platform may facilitate linkage between ad network participants e.g. publishers wireless operators and their subscribers e.g. users of mobile communication facilities to better target advertisements to subscribers. The wireless operator may collect subscriber information including behavioral information from interactions with mobile communication facilities and then provide this information to the monetization platform. Publishers may collect user information including behavioral information from interactions between publishers content and mobile communication facilities and then provide this information to the monetization platform. Ad network participants may be provided contingent access to the monetization platform to gain access to the subscriber data. Once the ad network participant gains access to the subscriber information the ad network participant may use the subscriber information to target advertisements or for some other purpose e.g. analyzing the effectiveness of a prior ad campaign . In an example the ad network participant may have selected subscriber information relating to a specific type of user e.g. sports fan such that advertisements of interest to sports fans can be sent to the subscribers with a behavioral data history that has been categorized within the monetization platform as indicative of the user s being a sports fan. In other embodiments the ad network participant may access groups of subscriber information and then perform their own analytics on the data to decide what advertisements should be matched with particular subscribers or groups of subscribers.

The wireless operator or publisher data may include user profile data which may include or reference behavioral data that relates to the user s mobile communication facility usage. The user profile data may include geographic data demographic data historical usage data device and configuration data and the like. The financial consideration derived from the access and or use of user data provided by the monetization platform may be based on a flat fee a fixed amount variable amount impression based e.g. cost per thousand impression or CPM cost per click CPC cost per action CPA time based based on a shared revenue of user transactions shared with a wireless operator whose data is being accessed shared with a publisher shared with an ad network or otherwise arranged. The fee may include a revenue sharing component that may be based in part on an advertising fee generated by the ad network publisher wireless operator or third party. The revenue shared with the wireless operator may include a portion of the flat fee a portion of the advertising fee a combination of both or other revenue sharing alternatives as may be understood. The ad network may be a performance based ad network that may include a bidding platform that may be used to purchase an access grant to mobile users behavioral or other data through the monetization platform. In embodiments the monetization platform may include a bidding platform for the purpose of determining a financial consideration to be paid upon access to data from the monetization platform. The monetization platform bidding platform may accommodate bids from ad networks publishers wireless operators and third parties and enable these entities to bid on specific user data user data categories user profile types user profile segments data aggregations grouped user data user data that is enriched with third party data or some other subset or data type that is available through the monetization platform. In embodiments an ad server and or ad network may be associated with a publisher a wireless operator a website owner a content producer a game developer an application developer a videographer a blogger and the like.

Referring still to wireless user behavioral data otherwise referred to as subscriber behavioral data may be syndicated through a monetization platform server to facilitate targeting of ads to mobile communication facility users. Behavioral data may be requested by an ad server such as an ad server that is associated with an ad network or publisher to facilitate targeting of ads to mobile communication facility users. When an ad server requests behavioral data from the monetization platform the advertisers that subscribe to the ad server and at least the wireless operator or publisher that collects and provides the behavioral data may benefit. The benefit may be a financial benefit in that the monetization platform server may facilitate collecting financial considerations from the ad server and sharing the financial considerations with the wireless operator. Financial consideration may include a flat fee a fixed amount variable amount impression based e.g. cost per thousand impression or CPM cost per click CPC cost per action CPA time based based on a shared revenue of user transactions shared with a wireless operator whose data is being accessed shared with a publisher shared with an ad network or otherwise arranged. Financial consideration may also include a share of revenue derived from the advertisements. Financial consideration may be based on a number of mobile users who receive a targeted advertisement based on the delivered behavioral data. Other types of financial consideration related to behavioral data delivery and use for ad targeting may be understood and are herein included.

In an example of financial consideration and sharing with a wireless operator an ad server may request behavioral data for mobile users who routinely use their mobile communication device to access the wireless operator network during weekday morning commuting hours. The monetization platform may establish a fee for this data based on a variety of criteria including without limitation a count of users meeting the criteria a geographic area e.g. metro NYC may be more valuable than Sharon Mass. and the like. Based on the fee paid the monetization platform may deliver behavioral data that sufficiently matches the request. The monetization platform may retain a portion of the fee such as 30 for facilitating the delivery of the data and provide a portion of the remainder to the wireless operator. Other splits of the financial consideration as described herein between at least the monetization platform and the wireless operator may be included.

As part of delivering the behavioral data to the ad server the monetization platform may request an update of behavioral information from the wireless operator or publisher to ensure the information delivered to the ad server is up to date. The wireless operator may determine when the last update of behavioral data was sent to the monetization platform for storage in a behavioral database and an incremental update of behavioral data may be sent. Data integration validation and other data handling techniques as described herein may be used to integrate and or associate new behavioral or other data with the data already stored in the behavioral database . Statistical analysis techniques data mining and other analytic techniques as described herein may be used to integrate and or associate new behavioral or other data with the data already stored in the behavioral database . Statistical analysis techniques data mining and other analytic techniques may also be used to draw statistical inferences based at least in part on the new data derive new behavioral profile categories or associations and the like. The update may include only behavioral data collected from mobile communication facility users since the last update. Alternatively the flow of behavioral data from the mobile communication facility to the wireless operator or publisher and on to the behavioral database may be continuous so that no request for updating is required. Delivery may be made in a batch delivery or streamed to the monetization platform in realtime as the new data are made available based on new user behaviors.

In another example of revenue sharing an ad server such as an ad server that is associated with an ad network or publisher may request behavioral data from the monetization server and base financial consideration on a count of users that will receive a targeted ad based on the behavioral data. The ad server may make the request to the monetization platform server and the monetization platform server may provide an estimate of the number of users who may receive an ad. The ad server may agree to pay for at least a minimum number of users based on the estimate. In an example the ad server may request behavioral data for all female mobile communication users who have recently searched for eyewear. The monetization platform may analyze the behavioral data provided by the wireless operator s e.g. using the data integration and or statistical analytic techniques as described herein and determine that approximately 27 000 female mobile communication facility users spread across four wireless operators operators A B C and D have recently searched for eyewear. The ad server may agree to pay a fixed amount or any other type of financial consideration as described herein to serve ads to up to 11 000 of the users only for operators A and C. The monetization platform server may deliver the behavioral data for the users from operators A and C but may or may not provide the behavioral data for users from operators B and D. The financial consideration provided by the ad server may be split among the monetization platform operator A and operator B publishers or other parties associated with the monetization platform based on the number of users targeted for each operator. Further in the example operator A users may represent 20 of the targeted users and operator B users represent 80 . The monetization platform may retain 30 of the fee and then provide 14 to operator A and 56 to operator B.

Financial consideration may include payments associated with a bidding platform that may be associated with an ad network an ad server and or the monetization platform. In embodiments the bidding platform may be included within the monetization platform. The ad server may propose as financial consideration a portion of revenue from bidding to be provided to the monetization platform. The ad server may provide a request for behavioral data to the monetization platform and in response to the request the monetization platform may identify minimum bids for the data. The minimum bids may be associated with various aspects of the data. In an example minimum bids may be established for regional aggregate data demographic aggregate data data based on a count of users individual user profile data a category of user data related third party data and the like. Based on the results of bidding for the requested behavioral data the monetization platform may provide one or more deliveries of the behavioral data to the ad server . Also based on the results the wireless operator or publisher providing the behavioral data may be compensated for providing the behavioral data.

Other sources of financial consideration may include publishers . An ad server may be associated with a publisher or communicate with a publisher such as content publishers who may wish to target their publications to users. All financial considerations as described herein may apply to publishers . In an example a publisher such as a game developer may desire to target a newly developed game to an audience of mobile users who have played similar games. An ad server associated with the publisher may provide a request to the monetization platform for behavioral data that meets for example a game play similarity criterion user characteristic usage history datum or some other type of user data or data associated with a mobile communication facility. With a financial consideration established the monetization platform server may provide behavioral data to the ad server to facilitate identifying candidate users for targeting. The game developer may contact one or more of the candidate users to offer the newly developed game an advertisement for the game a subscription offer or some other type of sponsored content. A wireless operator or publisher including the game developer publisher may provide and capture users behavioral data and provide it to the monetization platform. In a continuation of the example the game developer publisher may provide copies of its own behavioral data that is has collected from its customers to the monetization platform such as those mobile communication facility users that have previously accessed the game developer s content. The monetization platform may provide data integration and or statistical analysis of the publisher s data using any or all of the techniques described herein and provide back to the publisher actionable data that the publisher may use to select or target a desired subset of the users represented in the dataset. This publisher dataset may also be used to select non publisher users that are available in another dataset maintained by the monetization platform and that match the publisher s desired user subset upon some criterion e.g. a behavioral history of accessing gaming content on a mobile communication facility . Behavioral data may be provided automatically or may be offered to the game developer for an additional financial consideration that could be distributed to at least the wireless provider publisher third party or the monetization platform.

In embodiments publishers may communicate with an ad server and or with ad networks associated with advertisers. Publishers may provide ad spots in their publications that may be filled by ads provided from advertisers e.g. secondary content providers . The monetization platform may facilitate providing targeted ads in the publisher s ad spots by providing behavioral data in response to a request by the ad server . The ad server may form a request for behavioral data based on information provided by the publisher . The monetization platform server may analyze behavioral data stored in a behavioral database that may include behavioral profile data for a plurality of mobile users across a plurality of wireless operators . The analysis may be based on the request so that behavioral data may be provided to the ad server that may facilitate targeting ads for placement in the publisher s ad spots. In an example a publisher of a parent on line newsletter may request the ad server to fill ad spots in the newsletter with appropriate ads. The ad server may query the monetization platform for behavioral data that may relate to parenting e.g. users with family share mobile usage plans . Relevant behavioral data from an ad network that is associated with an advertiser may be selected for users that relate to parenting and the data delivered to the monetization platform and ad server which may use the data to identify and place ads in the ad spots identified by the parent news letter publisher . Alternatively the monetization platform server may send the ad network content to the publisher s ad server rather than data that is to be used to select the ad network content.

The monetization platform server may have access to third party data that may be accessed when performing any and all of the data integration and statistical analytic steps as described herein including preparing behavioral data for delivery in response to a request from an ad server . Third party data may include public databases subscription databases freeware databases purchased databases and the like. Public databases may include census data voter registration real estate assessment data public registry vehicle registry court records and the like. There are many sources of public and private information that may be relevant to behavioral data use that may be understood and included herein. Subscription and or purchased private databases may include a wide variety of internet access analytics and clickstream analytics data including normalized aggregated regional and the like. In an example of third party data use in association with syndicating behavioral data the monetization platform server may receive a request for behavioral data of users in the Boston area who have recently used their mobile communication facility to search for information about mortgage financing or refinancing. The monetization platform may access third party data related to home sales and or refinance activity such as from local registry of deeds databases. By combining the third party information with the behavioral information users who have recently refinanced or recently purchased a home may be identified within the behavioral data. The monetization platform may deliver behavioral data that may include integrated third party data in order to provide a more comprehensive set of behavioral data. As described above a financial consideration may be based on an availability of relevant third party data . In this example due to the relevant third party data the monetization platform server may offer a version of the behavioral data without the third party data for one financial consideration and offer an integrated version for another potentially greater financial consideration.

In embodiments behavioral data provided from a wireless operator publisher or third party may be analyzed based at least in part on the data integration and statistical analysis techniques as described herein to create and maintain a behavioral profile such as a behavioral profile of a subscriber to the wireless operator network. Behavioral data may include wireless operator network interactions associated with a user s mobile communication facility. Interactions such as calls received calls made SMS and other text messages sent and received email sent and received internet activity such as searching web browsing file downloading file uploading mobile application execution and the like may be captured and provided by the wireless operator for creation of a wireless user behavioral profile. The user behavioral profile may be used to facilitate targeting ads to the user by associating information included in and derived from the profile with other information such as aggregated behavioral data and the like. In an example of using user behavioral profile data in ad targeting an ad server may request a monetization platform server to provide behavioral information associated with users whose behavioral profile contains information that can be matched to criteria such as users who have recently searched the internet using their mobile communication facility for a new wireless service plan. In the example the monetization platform may analyze user behavioral profiles to determine that certain users meet these criteria. The monetization platform may select a portion of the information contained in the behavioral profiles of matching users and deliver the selected information to the ad server . The ad server may then perform some additional analysis to determine which ads currently being offered by an ad network may be appropriate to target to these users. Further in the example the ad server may determine that users of a wireless operator A who meet the criteria may be targets to receive an ad offering discounted service from wireless operator B. In this way the ad server can identify user profiles to target and can then communicate with the monetization platform server to facilitate delivery of the ads to the target users. In an alternate embodiment of the example the entire analysis of user data may take place within the monetization platform server using the data integration and statistical analytic techniques as described herein so that the information delivered to the ad server already includes the matching between users to the content that they should receive such that no additional analytic step is required at the ad server and the ad server may execute content delivery to users per the instructions and data it receives from the monetization platform.

A monetization platform server may include features to manage a behavioral database of wireless user behavioral data. Wireless operators and publishers may provide behavioral data such as individual transactions associated with individual mobile communication facilities that the monetization platform server may manipulate and store in the behavioral database . By including behavioral data from a plurality of mobile users in the behavioral database the monetization platform may perform analysis of this data to generate important aggregated and differentiated results that may be valuable to advertisers and therefore may allow the wireless operator to be compensated for the data. Although the data may be stored in the behavioral database as individual records or individual transactions the data may be related through the database e.g. a relational database of behavioral data to enable access to all behavioral data associated with a specific mobile communication facility or a specific wireless user. Behavioral information stored in the behavioral database may be maintained by the monetization platform server so that the data remains relevant and timely. In an example as behavioral data is added to the database it may be time stamped to ensure that only current or recent information is used. Maintenance activities such as identifying aging data and requesting updates of the aged data from a wireless operator may be performed by the monetization platform server . Such maintenance activities may be associated with the data integration and statistical analysis techniques as described herein. Many other database functions maintenance activities and the like will be understood and are herein incorporated.

Referring to behavioral data syndication may include a wireless operator or publisher receiving user related behavioral data from a mobile communication facility and then providing the information or some derivative of the information to a third party for consideration in the form of revenue sharing. The wireless operator may also provide the user behavioral data to be stored in a behavioral dataset such as behavioral database . Third party data may be included with or accessible in association with the behavioral database . The behavioral database may be transformed and or analyzed using data integration and statistical techniques as described herein. The analysis results may also be stored in or accessible through the behavioral database . A monetization platform server may access the behavioral database the analytics the third party data and the like. An ad server such as an ad server associated with an ad network or publisher may issue a request for behavioral data to the monetization platform server . In response to this request the monetization platform server may deliver behavioral data that is based on the request and an associated availability condition to the ad server . The associated availability condition may limit access to the delivered behavioral data. Access by the ad server may be limited. Alternatively distribution of the data to an ad network may be limited. Other availability conditions may be included. The ad server may interface to an ad network that may be a performance based ad network that may include a bidding platform. The bidding platform may facilitate advertisers associated with the ad network bidding for access to behavioral data. Alternatively the bidding platform may be included within the monetization platform and the bidding activity of sponsors and others occur as part of their interaction with the monetization platform. The monetization platform may set a minimum or reserve bid amount at which a bidder must begin a bidding process. The advertisers may bid for the right to submit a request for the behavioral data the right to access delivered behavioral data and the like. The ad server may also interface with publishers such as content publishers to facilitate forming requests for behavioral data and the like.

Availability conditions associated with the behavioral data that is delivered to the ad server may include time access limitations e.g. expiration date for access frequency of access limitations a limit on the number of behavioral profiles accessed a limit on access to information identifying an individual a limit on access to information that represents details below a resolution limit e.g. geographic detail below a region such as a city terms of use of the data and the like.

In embodiments availability conditions may be based on the behavioral data delivered in response to a request for behavioral data. Aspects of the behavioral data may influence the availability conditions. If the behavioral data is blinded behavioral data then the availability conditions may include limits on access to information that may be associated with the blinded data. Blinded data may include datasets that have had data variables omitted or altered i.e. blinded to observers so that the use of the data cannot include a variable or variable quantity. In an example the variable sex may be blinded in the dataset through omission so that an ad server may not exclusively target male or female user. In another example the variable Time may be blinded to include only A.M. or P.M such that an advertiser wanting to only target users that have performed some sort of mobile communication facility activity during rush hour i.e. 4 pm to 6 pm would be required to purchase an additional access grant i.e. a new availability condition to receive the Time variable with hourly gradations as opposed to the less useful A.M. P.M designation. In an example blinded data may include any data type and variable used by the monetization platform.

In an example of time availability constraints the behavioral data may be accessible through an interface that may respond to an access request by comparing the current date and time e.g. retrieved through a system function of the ad server with a data expiration data defined in the availability condition. If the expiration date has not yet been passed the interface may provide access to the data. If the expiration date has passed access to the data may be disallowed by the interface.

In an example of limiting access to a portion of the data the portion to which access is limited may be encoded while the remainder of the data may be accessible without having to be decoded. Alternatively all of the data may be encoded however a portion of the data to which access is not allowed may be encoded differently than other portions to which access is allowed. In an example of geographic limitation associated with geographic accuracy data may be structured so that data elements associated with individual users may be encoded whereas data associated with a geographic region e.g. a city block a village a city a state a county a time zone a political voting district a congressional district and the like may not be encoded and therefore may not be accessible to the ad server . Further in the example while aggregate behavioral data derived from users who reside in a voting district may be provided access to the behavioral data of the individuals within the voting district may be prohibited through the availability condition. An example of aggregate data may include without limitation a percentage of registered democrats republicans and independents in a voting district. Other aggregate examples may be understood and are included herein. Although ad server access to the user data may be limited the monetization platform may support fulfilling an ad server request that an ad be delivered to selected users residing in a voting district based on the availability conditions. In an example if the ad server can access behavioral data that facilitates distinguishing registered republicans from registered democrats such as in the example above the monetization platform server may facilitate providing ads to the registered republicans in a voting district.

Availability conditions associated with behavioral data may include restrictions on access to personal identification data. Information that may identify an individual wireless operator user e.g. a name address mobile phone number and the like may be included in the information provided to the ad server but may not be available to the ad server . The ad server may be allowed to access individual user behavioral profiles but the identification information may be encoded so that only a unique code is available to the ad server for each wireless user profile. Blinded data may facilitate analysis and targeting of individual users without identifying the user. Blinded data also may provide privacy to wireless mobile network subscribers so that the ad server can target individuals based on behavioral profile data but cannot access personal information such as identifying information about the user. In an example an ad network may wish to target an advertisement to be delivered to individual mobile network users who have searched for information about the democratic presidential nominee within the last 72 hours. Even without having access to the mobile number of the individual users the ad server may access the delivered behavioral data to determine if individual users matching the criteria are included in the data. If so the monetization platform may facilitate delivery of an advertisement targeted to the users matching the targeting criteria. This may be possible because even though the ad server does not have access to the mobile user contact information the monetization server may have such access and therefore may facilitate delivery of the ad to the selected users.

Availability conditions associated with wireless user behavioral data delivered from the monetization platform may include a limitation on the number of user behavioral profiles that can be accessed by the ad server . Although the behavioral data may represent substantially all subscribers to a wireless service the availability condition may limit access to fewer than all of the users provided. In an example an ad server may receive the behavioral data for more than 10 000 mobile users however the availability condition may limit access to only 5 000 mobile users. In this way once the ad server has accessed user behavioral profiles from the delivered behavioral data further access will be denied.

In embodiments availability conditions associated with the behavioral data that is delivered to the ad server may include a behavioral data interface layer that may be a program such as a driver so that the behavioral data must be accessed through the interface layer. This may be accomplished by encoding the information and encapsulating the data with an application program type interface API . The ad server could access the data only through the API. In this way availability conditions may be enforced by the API.

In embodiments availability conditions may also be influenced by results of bidding associated with an ad network bidding platform. The monetization platform server may establish a minimum bid requirement to make available certain portions of the behavioral data. If advertisers do not meet the minimum bid requirements the availability condition may limit access to the portions for which a minimum bid was established and not met.

Referring to in embodiments behavioral data associated with mobile communication facility users may be provided by a plurality of wireless operators publishers or other parties having interaction with or access to mobile communication facility users. In embodiments wireless operator or other behavioral data may be enriched with other data types within the monetization platform for distribution to an ad server in response to an ad server request for behavioral data. Behavioral data that may be retrieved from one or more third parties. A user behavioral profile maybe retrieved from a behavioral database of behavior profiles from a plurality of mobile communication facility users using a plurality of wireless operators . The third party data that may be obtained from one or more third parties may be associated with the retrieved user s behavioral profile. The association of the third party data and the behavioral data may be stored in an enriched behavioral database that may include a plurality of associations between third party data and profile data from multiple mobile communication facility users. The enriched behavioral database may include data and or associations of data from a plurality of wireless operator users a plurality of wireless operators a plurality of publishers and or a plurality of third parties. An ad server may request behavioral data from the monetization platform server relating to at least a portion of the plurality of wireless users such as requesting a mobile communication facility user s behavioral profile. In response to the request behavioral data and associated third party data may be selected from the behavioral database and any portion of the selected data may be delivered to the requesting ad server . Alternatively an association of third party data with the requested user s behavioral profile maybe selected from the enriched behavioral database for delivery. Delivering the selected data and or association may occur substantially simultaneous to receiving the request. Either simultaneously or at another time the data may be delivered as a batch. The batch may represent a series of requests that have been received over a period of time from one ad server over a period of time and the like. The batch may include data related to the request as well as data related to the requested data. In an example if a user subscribes to a mobile communication share plan a request for profile data from any user in the share plan may result in data for all users of the share plan being delivered as a batch. The third party data may be sourced from one or more data sources including census data environmental data voter registration data education data salary survey data home value data town tax records and the like.

The enriched behavioral database may include a wide variety of associations between user profile and third party data . A user profile association with third party data may include associations between the user profile and third party data from a single third party or from multiple third parties. The enriched database may include multiple associations for a user profile. Each association may be between the single user profile and third party data from one or more third parties. In an example a stored association in the enriched behavioral database may associate a user profile with census and home value demographic data. Alternatively a first stored association may associate a user profile with census data and a second stored association may associate the user profile with home value demographic data. For example behavioral data relating to a user such as webpage views transactions location detection and so forth may be processed and statistically analyzed within the monetization platform using any of the methods described herein in a manner that categorizes the user as a consumer of financial products such as retirement plans annuities certificates of deposit and the like. Because this behavioral data may not include information relating to the user s income bracket a third party data set may be associated with the user to select a medium home price for the neighborhood in which the user lives. This association may be more valuable to a publisher ad network or other entity insofar as it indicates that the user is both a consumer of financial products and is likely a member of a given income bracket. This enriched data on the user may permit the publisher or other entity to select content for display on the user s mobile communication facility that offers a financial product to the user but that is also more closely related to the financial product needs of persons within his particular income bracket.

In embodiments a user profile may be derived from behavioral data received from one or more wireless operators . Third party data may be associated with a user profile that is derived from behavioral data from multiple wireless operators in a variety of ways. A user profile that is derived from behavioral data from multiple wireless operators may be treated as a homogeneous profile that supports associations similarly to a user profile derived from a behavioral data from a single wireless operator . Alternatively elements of a user profile may be identified with the wireless operator from which the element was derived. In such an alternative elements within a user profile may be associated with third party data based on the wireless operator from which the element was derived. Such association may facilitate differentiation that is beneficial to an ad server . In an example a user profile contains elements derived from a first wireless operator and a second wireless operator because the user switched from the first to the second wireless operator . Associating the user profile elements derived from each wireless operator to aggregated wireless internet use statistics may help determine how a user s behavior changed relative to the aggregated data when the user switched from the first to the second wireless operator .

The enriched behavioral database may include associations of profile data that is derived from multiple wireless mobile communication facility users with third party data . Profiles that may be derived from multiple wireless mobile communication facility users may also be derived from behavioral data from a plurality of wireless operators . Therefore associations in the enriched behavioral database may include one or more associations between third party data from one or more third parties with one or more profiles derived from behavioral data from a plurality of users and from a plurality of wireless operators . In contrast to the user profile to third party data associations described above in which a single wireless mobile communication facility user profile that may be derived from a behavioral data from a plurality of wireless operators a multiple user profile alternatively referred to only as a profile that may be derived from behavioral data from multiple wireless operators may be associated with third party data and the association s may be stored in the enriched behavioral database .

In response to a request for behavioral data or for profile data an ad server may receive data from the behavioral database within the monetization platform e.g. behavioral data user profile data profile data or data from the enriched behavioral database within the monetization platform e.g. association of a user profile with third party data association of a profile with third party data data from both the behavioral database and the enriched behavioral database and the like.

Referring still to behavioral profile syndication may include a plurality of wireless operators receiving user related behavioral data from a mobile communication facility . The wireless operators may further provide the user behavioral data to be stored in a behavioral dataset such as a behavioral database . Third party data may be included with or accessible in association with the behavioral database and associations may be stored in an enriched behavioral dataset . The behavioral database may be processed and analyzed such as through data integration statistical analysis data mining stream analysis as described herein or using some other data processing or statistical method. The analysis results may also be stored in or accessible through the behavioral database . A monetization platform server may access the behavioral database the analytics the enriched behavioral dataset the third party data and the like. An ad server such as an ad server associated with an ad network or publisher may issue a request for behavioral data user profile data user profile associations between user profile s and third party data and the like to the monetization platform server . In response to this request the monetization platform server may deliver behavioral data user profile data association data and the like that is based on the request to the ad server . The ad server may interface to an ad network that may be a performance based ad network that may include a bidding platform. The bidding platform may facilitate advertisers associated with the ad network bidding for access to behavioral related data provided by the monetization platform server . In embodiments the monetization platform may include a bidding platform for the purpose of determining a financial consideration to be paid upon access to data from the monetization platform. The monetization platform bidding platform may accommodate bids from ad networks publishers wireless operators and third parties and enable these entities to bid on specific user data user data categories user profile types user profile segments data aggregations grouped user data user data that is enriched with third party data or some other subset or data type that is available through the monetization platform. The advertisers may bid for the right to submit a request for data the right to access delivered data and the like. The ad server may interface with publishers such as content publishers to facilitate forming requests for behavioral data and the like.

Wireless user behavioral data which may be represented as user profile data multiple user profile data third party associations and the like may be syndicated such as through a monetization platform server to facilitate targeting of ads to mobile communication facility users. Behavioral data may be requested by an ad server to facilitate targeting of ads to mobile communication facility users. When an ad server requests behavioral data from a monetization platform the advertisers ad networks publishers or other parties associated with the ad server and at least the one or more wireless operators that collects and provides the behavioral data may benefit. The benefit may be a financial benefit in that the monetization platform server may facilitate collecting financial considerations from the ad server and sharing the financial considerations with the one or more wireless operators publishers or others. Financial consideration may include flat fee a fixed amount variable amount impression based e.g. cost per thousand impression or CPM cost per click CPC cost per action CPA time based based on a shared revenue of user transactions shared with a wireless operator whose data is being accessed shared with a publisher shared with an ad network or otherwise arranged. Other types of financial consideration related to behavioral data delivery and use for ad targeting may be understood and are herein included.

As part of delivering the behavioral data to the ad server the monetization platform may request an update of behavioral information from the one or more wireless operators publishers or other data providers to ensure the information delivered to the ad server is up to date. The one or more data providers may determine when the last update of behavioral data was sent to the monetization platform for storage in a behavioral database and an incremental update of behavioral data may be sent. The update may include only behavioral data collected from mobile communication facility users since the last update. Alternatively the flow of behavioral data from the mobile communication facility to the one or more data providers and on to the behavioral database may be continuous so that no request for updating is required and may be initiated monitored and managed by the monetization platform.

In embodiments publishers may communicate with the ad server that may communicate with ad networks of advertisers. Publishers may provide ad spots in their publications that may be filled by ads provided from advertisers. The monetization platform facilitates providing targeted ads in the publisher s ad spots by providing behavioral data in response to a request by the ad server . The ad server may form a request for behavioral data based on information provided by the publisher . The monetization platform server may analyze behavioral data stored in a behavioral database that may include behavioral profile data for a plurality of mobile users across a plurality of wireless operators . The analysis may be based on the request so that behavioral data may be provided to the ad server that may facilitate targeting ads for placement in the publishers ad spots. In an example a publisher of a parent on line newsletter may request the ad server to fill ad spots in the newsletter with appropriate ads. The ad server may query the monetization platform for behavioral data that may relate to parenting e.g. users with family share mobile usage plans . Relevant behavioral data for users that relate to parenting may be delivered to the ad server which may use the data to identify and place ads in the ad spots identified by the parent news letter publisher .

The monetization platform server may have access to third party data that may be accessed when preparing behavioral data for delivery in response to a request from an ad server . The monetization platform server may also have access to an enriched behavioral database that may be populated with associations between aggregated user profile data that is derived from user behavioral data and third party data that is acquired from one or more third parties. Third party data may include public databases subscription databases freeware databases purchased databases and the like. Public databases may include census data voter registration real estate assessment data public registry vehicle registry court records and the like. There are many sources of public information that may be relevant to aggregated behavioral data use that may be understood and included herein. Subscription and or purchased databases may include a wide variety of internet access analytics and clickstream analytics data including normalized aggregated regional and the like. In an example of third party data use in association with syndicating behavioral data the monetization platform server may analyze behavioral data in the behavioral database associate it with third party data and store the association in an enriched behavioral database . In response to a behavioral data related request from an ad server the monetization platform may select data from the behavioral database associations from the enriched behavioral data data from both behavioral and enriched behavioral databases and the like and deliver the selected data to the ad server .

In embodiments behavioral data provided from a one or more wireless operators publishers or other data providers may be analyzed to create a behavioral profile such as a behavioral profile of a subscriber to a wireless network. Behavioral data may include wireless network interactions associated with a user s mobile communication facility. Behavioral data may include interactions between a user s mobile communication facility and a plurality of wireless operator networks such as when a user switches mobile plans . Interactions such as calls received calls made SMS and other text messages sent and received email sent and received internet activity such as searching web browsing file downloading file uploading mobile application execution and the like may be captured and provided by the one or more wireless operators for creation of a wireless user behavioral profile. The user behavioral profile may be used to facilitate targeting ads to the user by associating information included in and derived from the profile with other information such as aggregated behavioral data and the like. In an example of using user behavioral profile data in ad targeting an ad server may request a monetization platform server to provide behavioral information associated with users whose behavioral profile contains information that can be matched to criteria such as users who have recently searched the internet using their mobile communication facility for a new wireless service plan. In the example the monetization platform may analyze user behavioral profiles using data derived from multiple operators to determine that certain users meet these criteria. The monetization platform may select a portion of the information contained in the behavioral profiles of matching users and deliver the selected information to the ad server . The ad server may then perform some additional analysis to determine which ads currently being offered by an ad network may be appropriate to target to these users. Further in the example the ad server may determine that users of a wireless operator A who meet the criteria may be targets to receive an ad offering discounted service from wireless operator B. In this way the ad server can identify user profiles to target and can then communicate with the monetization platform server to facilitate delivery of the ads to the target users.

A monetization platform server may include features to manage a behavioral database of wireless user behavioral data. Wireless operators publishers or other data providers may provide behavioral data such as individual transactions associated with individual mobile communication facilities that the monetization platform server may manipulate analyze and store in the behavioral database . By including behavioral data from a plurality of mobile users in the behavioral database and from a plurality of wireless operators the monetization platform may perform analysis of this data to generate important aggregated and differentiated results that may be valuable to advertisers and therefore may allow the wireless operators to be compensated for the data. Although the data may be stored in the behavioral database as individual records or individual transactions the data may be related through the database e.g. a relational database of behavioral data to enable access to all behavioral data associated with a specific mobile communication facility a specific wireless user an association of a wireless user with a wireless operator and the like. Behavioral information stored in the behavioral database may be maintained by the monetization platform server so that the data remains current. In an example as behavioral data is added to the database it may be time stamped to ensure only current information is used. Maintenance activities such as identifying aging data and requesting updates of the aged data from one or more wireless operators may be performed by the monetization platform server . Many other database functions maintenance activities analyses and the like will be understood and are herein incorporated.

Referring to behavioral data syndication may include one or more wireless operators receiving user related behavioral data from a mobile communication facility . The one or more wireless operators may further provide the user behavioral data to be stored in a behavioral dataset such as behavioral database . Third party data may be included with or accessible in association with the behavioral database and associations may be stored in an enriched behavioral dataset . The behavioral database may be analyzed such as through statistical analysis data mining stream analysis as described herein or using some other statistical method. The analysis results may also be stored in or accessible through the behavioral database . A monetization platform server may access the behavioral database the analytics the enriched behavioral dataset the third party data and the like. An ad server such as an ad server associated with an ad network may issue a request for behavioral data user profile data user profile associations between user profile s and third party data and the like to the monetization platform server . In response to this request the monetization platform server may deliver behavioral data user profile data association data and the like that is based on the request and an associated availability condition to the ad server . The associated availability condition may limit access to the delivered behavioral data. Access by the ad server may be limited. Alternatively distribution of the data to an ad network may be limited. Other availability conditions may be included as described herein. The ad server may interface to an ad network that may be a performance based ad network that may include a bidding platform. The bidding platform may facilitate advertisers publishers operators or to others associated with the ad network bidding for access to behavioral related data provided by the monetization platform server . The advertisers and others may bid for the right to submit a request for the behavioral data the right to access delivered behavioral data and the like. The ad server may also interface with publishers such as content publishers to facilitate forming requests for behavioral data and the like.

Availability conditions associated with the behavioral data and or associations with third party data that is delivered to the ad server may include time access limitations e.g. expiration date for access frequency of access limitations a limit on the number of behavioral profiles accessed a limit on access to information identifying an individual a limit on access to information that represents details below a resolution limit e.g. geographic detail below a region such as a city terms of use of the data and the like.

Availability conditions may be based on the behavioral data or enriched behavioral data delivered in response to a request for behavioral data. Aspects of the behavioral data may influence the availability conditions. If the behavioral data is blinded behavioral data then the availability conditions may include limits on access to information that may be associated with the blinded data.

Availability conditions associated with behavioral data derived from multiple data sources e.g. multiple wireless operators may include restrictions on access to personally identifying information. Information that may identify an individual wireless operator user e.g. a name address mobile phone number and the like may be included in the information provided to the ad server but may not be available to the ad server . The ad server may be allowed to access individual user behavioral profiles but the identification information may be encoded so that only a unique code is available to the ad server for each wireless user profile. Blinded data may facilitate analysis and targeting of individual users without identifying the user. Blinded data also may provide privacy to wireless mobile network subscribers so that the ad server can target individuals based on behavioral profile data but cannot access personal information such as identifying information about the user. In an example an ad network may wish to target an advertisement to be delivered to individual mobile network users who have searched for information about the democratic presidential nominee within the last 72 hours. Even without having access to the mobile number of the individual users the ad server may access the delivered behavioral data to determine if individual users matching the criteria are included in the data. If so the monetization platform may facilitate delivery of an advertisement targeted to the users matching the targeting criteria. This may be possible because even though the ad server does not have access to the mobile user contact information the monetization server may have such access and therefore may facilitate delivery of the ad to the selected users.

Availability conditions associated with wireless user behavioral data delivered from the monetization platform may include a limitation on the number of user behavioral profiles that can be accessed by the ad server . Although the behavioral data may represent substantially all subscribers to a wireless service the availability condition may limit access to fewer than all of the users provided. In an example and as server may receive the behavioral data for more than 10 000 mobile users however the availability condition may limit access to only 5 000 mobile users. In this way once the ad server has accessed user behavioral data profiles from the delivered behavioral data further access will be denied.

Availability conditions associated with the behavioral data that is delivered to the ad server may include a behavioral data interface layer that may be a program such as a driver so that the behavioral data must be accessed through the interface layer. This may be accomplished by encoding the information and encapsulating the data with an application program type interface API . The ad server could access the data only through the API. In this way availability conditions may be enforced by the API.

Availability conditions may also be influenced by results of bidding associated with an ad network bidding platform. The monetization platform server may establish a minimum bid requirement to make available certain portions of the behavioral data. If advertisers do not meet the minimum bid requirements the availability condition may limit access to the portions for which a minimum bid was established and not met.

Referring to a monetization platform as described herein may facilitate delivery of relevant sponsored content to a publisher by selecting the content from a plurality of content inventories based at least on a relevancy between the request and the content and further based on a revenue calculation that may be associated with a wireless operator . In embodiments a request from a publisher may be received by a monetization platform server and a plurality of content inventories may be searched for a content that is relevant to the request. Content may be selected for delivery to the publisher from one or more content inventories . The content may be selected based at least in part on a relevance determination between the content and the request . Content within the plurality of content inventories and or the monetization platform server may be further associated with an analytics facility that may perform tasks including but not limited to data integration data mining data optimization statistical analysis or some other data function. The plurality of content inventories may be further associated with a revenue calculation facility . The revenue calculation facility may include information relating to the amount of revenue a wireless operator may realize upon presentation of a content to a mobile communication facility. The revenue data within the revenue calculation facility may derive from a wireless operator a third party data provider the monetization platform or some other data source. The relevant content and the content inventory from which the relevant content is chosen may be selected based at least in part on a statistical weight from the analytics facility relating to the amount of revenue a wireless operator may realize upon presentation of the content to a mobile communication facility. Once the monetization platform server receives the relevant content the relevant content may be transmitted to the publisher originating the request. In another embodiment the monetization platform server may transmit the relevant content to a third party other than the publisher including but not limited to the mobile communication facility user. In another embodiment the revenue calculation facility may include data relating to the amount of revenue the operator of the monetization platform may realize upon presentation of a relevant content to a mobile communication facility and the relevancy determination may be based at least in part on this data.

All elements of the system depicted in may be operatively coupled as shown. These operative couplings may include any and all suitable communications channels including without limitation wireless and or wired communications channels. The information flowing over the operative couplings may include sponsored content analytic output interaction data or the like as respectively indicated by solid dashed or dotted lines. It will be understood that a variety of such channels are possible.

As described herein the publisher may be an owner of content a content producer an organization a wireless operator a website owner a game developer an application developer a videographer a blogger or some other type of content publisher. The publisher may be interested in sending sponsored content to a group of mobile users who may either be searching for a specified product or interested in making a transaction for product or service. Alternatively the publisher may be interested in distributing the sponsored content to a single user based on a user s behavior when interacting with a mobile communication facility. In embodiments the publisher may be interested in identifying the list of sponsored content that may be relevant to a set of users. Furthermore the publisher may generate profits by presenting the sponsored content to a mobile communication facility and the operator of the monetization platform may share in that profit. In embodiments a user may make a transaction based at least in part on the relevant content that he is presented and the publisher wireless operator and or operator of the monetization platform may share the revenue derived from the transaction.

In embodiments the publisher may forward a request to the sponsored content facility for relevant content based at least in part on a keyword user behavior user history user transaction user location user characteristics user mobile characteristics contextual information relating to content displayed on the mobile communication facility time of day and the like as described herein. The request for sponsored content facility may be modified based on the user characteristics mobile communication facility characteristics or some other characteristics as described herein. For example a request for a relevant content for presentation to a mobile communication facility that is unable to show high resolution video may be routed with data indicating that a relevant content must have no video content or low resolution video content in order to be considered relevant and be selected. The request for sponsored content may be forwarded to a relevancy determination facility or to the monetization platform server . In embodiments the request facility may forward the request to both the relevancy determination facility and the monetization platform server . The monetization facility may use the request for sponsored content to filter or modify the relevant content determined by an analytics data integration and data mining facility . Alternatively the requested sponsored content may be processed and stored in the monetization platform server for learning and or updating publisher profiles user profiles and the like.

In embodiments the monetization platform server may scan the log files to identify previous instances of similar requests to determine the content parameters that resulted in successful prior transactions. This information may be used by the monetization platform server to rearrange reorder and or reorganize the list of relevant content provided by the analytics data integration and data mining facility before sending it to the publisher . In an example a user looking for a mobile phone may receive a list of relevant sponsored content reordered by the monetization platform server . Reordering may result in listing of Nokia advertisements at the top since the logged information in the monetization platform server may indicate a recent transaction for purchase of a Nokia phone made by a second user that shares some characteristic with the user. The shared characteristic may be a mobile subscriber characteristic a user history a location a transaction history a mobile communication facility device characteristic or some other characteristic as described herein.

The relevancy determination facility may determine the relevancy of content to a request based at least in part on a keyword user behavior user history user transaction user location user characteristics user mobile characteristics contextual information relating to content displayed on the mobile communication facility time of day and the like as described herein. For example a keyword may be compared with the metadata associated with the content stored in the inventories to determine a list of possible matches. The relevancy determination facility may also include the method for relevancy comparison determination of relevancy score statistical weighting relevancy analysis and the like. For example the relevancy determination may be based on a relevancy score determined by and based on a mathematical equation characterizing the degree of match as high medium or low. Alternatively a numeric value may symbolize the degree of relevancy between the request for sponsored content and the content in the plurality of content inventories .

In embodiments the relevancy determination may be made using additional analytics and statistical analysis in the associated analytics facility . For example various statistical techniques known in the art such as logistic regression analysis multiple regression analysis factor analysis discriminant analysis correlation or some other statistical technique may be used to determine relevancy. In embodiments other techniques as described herein including neural networks data mining and artificial intelligence may be used for determining relevancy. In an example a relevancy determination facility may determine the relevancy between the request for sponsored content and the plurality of content inventories based on a strength of association between the a plurality of user characteristics associated with the mobile communication facility to which the content will be displayed and the predicted outcome of the user making a transaction. Alternatively the predicted outcome may be an expected revenue to be received by the wireless operator upon presentation of the selected relevant content to a user s mobile communication facility. In another example the statistical model used in relevancy determination may be used to maximize the expected revenues for the wireless operator over a plurality of requests rather than maximizing within only each individual request. For example a wireless operator may have agreements with third parties in which profits are realized by providing content to a stated mix of mobile communication facility users such as a demographic mix.

In embodiments the request for sponsored content that is sent by a publisher may be further associated by the monetization platform server with a mobile characteristic of a mobile communication facility user for determining the relevancy of the content. The mobile characteristics of the user may include but are not be limited to user profile user history a user transaction a geographic location geographic proximity a user device a time or other type of data that is associated with a user or a user s mobile communication facility as described herein. For example in determining the relevancy between the request for sponsored content and the content within the plurality of content inventories although the user may have entered spectacles as a search query content results associated with only trendy brand name sunglasses might be selected as relevant content based at least in part on a user transaction history that includes recent transactions relating to purchase of other trendy brand name fashion items. In embodiments mobile communication facility device characteristics may also be used by the monetization platform server to determine a relevancy including but not limited to display capability display size display resolution processing speed audio capability video capability cache size storage capability memory capacity or some other type of mobile communication facility characteristics.

In embodiments a request for sponsored content may be transmitted by a publisher to the monetization platform . The monetization platform server may refine forward update modify delete and add one or more data items to the request for the purposes of determining a relevant content to deliver to the publisher . For example a publisher that is an operator of a sports related website may request a video advertisement for presentation to a user s mobile communication facility that is currently being used to browse the publisher s website. The monetization platform server may receive the request and associate the request with data relating to content that has been previously forwarded to users of the publisher s website and select a relevant content based at least in part on content that has been previously forwarded to the website s users and resulted in a user clickthrough transaction or some other desirable outcome.

In embodiments the monetization platform server may forward the request for sponsored content to a relevancy determination facility . The forwarded request may be modified refined or altered in the monetization platform server . Alternatively the request for sponsored content may be forwarded without modification to the relevancy determination facility . Accordingly the relevancy determination facility may identify relevant content from among the plurality of content inventories based on the request.

In embodiments the monetization platform server may receive relevancy criteria from the relevancy determination facility . The relevancy determination facility may forward the relevancy criteria to the analytics data integration and data mining facility . The monetization platform server may utilize the inputs received from the relevancy determination facility to moderate the relevant content before forwarding it to the publisher . For example the monetization platform server may alter the request for sponsored content based on prior transmissions to reduce the number of results in the result set. In this example the request for sponsored content may be routed through the monetization platform server which forwards the request to the relevancy determination facility . In another embodiment the relevancy information received from the relevancy determination facility may be utilized by the monetization platform server to alter the relevant content.

In embodiments the request for sponsored content may be routed through the monetization platform server which may transmit the request to the analytics facility and then forward the request and associated analytic data to the relevancy determination facility . The forwarded request may be modified or altered before transmission. Alternatively the request may be forwarded without modification. In this embodiment the analytics data integration and data mining facility may query the plurality of content inventories to acquire data relating to content that may be used in relevancy determination. Further the data obtained by the execution of this query may be modified by the relevancy determination facility and finally sent to the monetization platform server . Alternatively the analytics data integration and data mining facility may receive inputs from relevancy determination facility and send a relevant content result to the monetization platform server . For example the monetization platform server may forward a request for sponsored content to the analytics data integration and data mining facility . The analytics data integration and data mining facility may generate a query and execute the query on the plurality of content inventories to obtain a result set. Subsequently the result set may be used by the relevancy determination facility to obtain a list of relevant content results based upon a criterion such as contextual information relating to the content. Finally the result set may be delivered to the monetization platform server . In addition the analytics data integration and data mining facility may also receive inputs from the relevancy determination facility and the content result set may be delivered to the monetization platform server after further refinement selection ordering prioritizing and the like by the analytics facility .

The monetization platform server may be operatively coupled to the wireless operator as well as the analytics data integration and data mining facility . In addition the monetization platform server may deliver the selected relevant content .

The monetization platform server may order selected content on parameters such as price revenue product brands or on some other parameter. The monetization platform server may allow a publisher to select a relevant content from within an ordering delivered by the monetization platform server . For example the publisher may be provided with a user interface by the monetization platform server to enable selection of one or more content to be forwarded to the mobile communication facility users. In another example the publisher s selection may be automated based at least in part on predetermined criteria stored within the monetization platform server or one of its associated facilities such as the analytics facility .

In embodiments the analytics facility may include but is not limited to other facilities such as data integration data mining statistical analysis simulation query engine and the like. The analytics data integration and data mining facility may enable querying of data from the plurality of content inventories . The result set obtained by execution of the query may be formatted by the data integration facility for proper presentation of data. In addition the analytics data integration and data mining facility may accomplish integration of data from one or more inventories as well as amalgamation of data into a presentable format. The analytics data integration and data mining facility may also facilitate data integration from other heterogeneous sources of data such as web databases third party databases organizational databases or some other type of data source. The analytics data integration and data mining facility may facilitate mining of data from the plurality of content inventories such as Inventory A Inventory B and Inventory C . The analytics data integration and data mining facility may enable updating datasets including content inventories and metadata relating to the content inventories including data from third party sources as described herein.

The plurality of content inventories may include one or more inventories . Although as described herein the plurality of content inventories are shown to include only three inventories those skilled in the art will appreciate that more than three inventories may be present in the plurality of content inventories . For example the plurality of content inventories may belong to a sponsor that is a shoe manufacturer. The inventories within the plurality may each relate to a different type of advertisement. For example Inventory A may include audio visual content Inventory B may include only visual content and Inventory C may include content only related to special price promotions. In embodiments the content may be coded ordered sorted prioritized or include some other type of metadata relating to the type of advertisement the content is e.g. logo image banner and the like product type e.g. jogging shoe hiking boot price product characteristics e.g. male shoe female shoe unisex or some other type of data. This metadata may be stored in the content inventories and or be created and stored by the monetization platform. In embodiments the plurality of inventories may contain advertisement promotional and other type of information for one or more companies. Furthermore the content inventories may be a database a flat file or some other type of storage medium. When the plurality of content inventories are organized as a database the database may be fragmented horizontally vertically or in a mixed mode. In addition a data mining operation such as association clustering and the like may be performed on the database in one or more ways and the results stored in the analytics facility for current and future use. Alternatively the content inventories such as inventory may be combined to form a data mart or a data warehouse allowing multiple analytics functions to be performed over it. Furthermore a data warehouse so formed may be queried on multiple dimensions by the analytic data integration and data mining facility .

The monetization platform server may be coupled to a wireless operator . The information relating to a mobile communication facility publisher content provider included in the plurality of content inventories and the like may be provided by a wireless operator a wireless service provider a telecommunications service provider and the like.

In embodiments the analytics data integration and data mining facility may be associated with the revenue calculation facility . One or more models for calculating revenue may be provided in revenue calculation facility that may determine the expected revenue to be received by a wireless operator when the selected content is delivered to the publisher and or presented to a mobile communication facility. For example an advertisement from a first sponsor may generate less revenue for the wireless operator if the first sponsor has an agreement with the wireless operator capping costs per clickthrough. However an advertisement by a second sponsor may generate larger revenues for the wireless operator if the second sponsor does not have a fee cap arrangement with the wireless operator . Thus the monetization platform server in association with the revenue calculation facility may prioritize the selection of the advertisement from the second sponsor since this will generate more revenue for the wireless operator .

In embodiments the revenue calculation facility may provide a calculation of expected revenue to be shared by the wireless operator and the publisher .

In embodiments a wireless operator may interact with the revenue calculation facility independently or through the monetization platform. The wireless operator may provide inputs that update revenue and other metrics that are associated with the wireless operator content publishers and the like. These inputs may include revenue calculations estimates statistical weights fee and subscription information relating to content providers past histories of mobile communication facility users publishers contract information or some other type of information. This information may be converted into qualitative and quantitative parameters and may be used by the monetization platform to select a relevant content.

In embodiments the revenue calculation facility may calculate revenue depending on the type of service that the publisher has registered with the monetization platform and or wireless operator . For example the publisher may be registered as a subscriber with the wireless operator or may pay on a per access basis. In addition the revenue calculation facility may consider multiple parameters including length of advertisement the amount of graphics present in the advertisement the bandwidth required for transmission and the like. For example a 30 second advertisement presented to a mobile user as a video may generate more revenue than a 15 second banner advertisement.

In an example a publisher may request a sponsored content based at least in part on a user browse history user history user transaction search query user characteristics mobile communication facility device characteristics or some other data that is associated with a mobile communication facility and or its user. For example a user may browse to a travel website using his mobile communication facility. A publisher associated with the website may witness the user s browse behavior and forward a request for a relevant content to present to the user s mobile communication facility display. This request may include data relating to the browse behavior of the user while visiting the publisher s site which may be forwarded to monetization platform server as part of the request. For example the browse behavior data may indicate that following the user s visit to the website s homepage the user next went to the Caribbean tours page selected the Tour Package Sale link and then went to the Cayman Islands portion of the Tour Package Sale page. The request data may be transmitted to the monetization platform server and or the relevancy determination facility . The relevancy determination facility may submit data relating to the request to the analytics facility for statistical analysis. Continuing the example on the basis of the types of web content that the user has visited the analytics facility may categorize and analytically code the user as a low cost traveler. The analytics facility may then return this coding to the relevancy determination facility which then searches among the plurality of content inventories for content that is relevant to a low cost traveler. In one embodiment the content inventories may include data indicating which is relevant to the low cost traveler. In another embodiment the analytics facility may send data to the relevancy determination facility indicating based on prior selections and usage patterns which inventories contain content that is relevant to the low cost traveler. Similarly content within a given inventory may be coded for its relevance to a low cost traveler. Once a set of relevant content is selected it may be further ordered based at least in part on data from the revenue calculation facility and the content that is most likely to generate revenue for the wireless operator and or monetization platform may be selected for delivery to the publisher. The selected relevant content may then be forwarded to the monetization platform server and onto the publisher for presentation to the low cost traveler s mobile communication facility. The selected relevant content may be presented within the publisher s website content along side the website as an interstitial or in some other presentation format as described herein. The above example does not limit in any way the scope or spirit of the invention. Other embodiments as described herein may be possible by changing the configuration grouping of elements and adding other elements without deviating from the scope of the invention.

Referring to a monetization platform as described herein may facilitate delivery of relevant sponsored content to a mobile communication facility user by selecting the content from a plurality of content inventories based at least on a relevancy determination between the request and the content and further based on a revenue calculation that may be associated with a wireless operator and behavioral data demographic data and geographic data that is associated with the user of a mobile communication facility . In embodiments a request from a publisher may be received by a monetization platform server and a plurality of content inventories may be searched for a content that is relevant to the request. Content may be selected for delivery to the publisher from one or more content inventories . The content may be selected based at least in part on a relevance determination between the content and the request . Content within the plurality of content inventories and or the monetization platform server may be further associated with an analytics facility that may perform tasks including but not limited to data integration data mining data optimization statistical analysis or some other data function. The plurality of content inventories may be further associated with a revenue calculation facility . The revenue calculation facility may include information relating to the amount of revenue a wireless operator may realize upon presentation of a content to a mobile communication facility. The revenue data within the revenue calculation facility may derive from a wireless operator a third party data provider the monetization platform or some other data source. The relevant content and the content inventory from which the relevant content is chosen may be selected based at least in part on a statistical weight from the analytics facility relating to the amount of revenue a wireless operator may realize upon presentation of the content to a mobile communication facility. Databases containing behavioral data demographic data and geographic data relating to users of mobile communication facilities may be associated with the monetization platform server . This data may derive from a wireless operator who receives this data from its service member s mobile communication facility and shares the data with the monetization platform server . Alternatively this data may be obtained by the monetization platform server from the publisher or any type of third party data source as described herein. Once the monetization platform server receives the relevant content the relevant content may be transmitted to the publisher originating the request. In another embodiment the monetization platform server may transmit the relevant content to a third party other than the publisher including but not limited to the mobile communication facility user.

Still referring to the relevancy determination facility may be operatively coupled with a contextual information facility that may include contextual information related to the content as described herein. In addition the contextual information facility may also be coupled with the analytics data integration and data mining facility . The contextual information facility may facilitate analysis of content in order to determine the relevant information from the plurality of content inventories . For example the relevancy determination facility may query the contextual information facility for contextual information relating to content among the plurality of content inventories such as keywords location of the content provider language of the content or any other type of contextual information as described herein. Thus when receiving a request from a publisher for a watch advertisement to present a user that is visiting the publisher s scuba diving website the relevancy determination facility may preferentially select content that has contextual information such as keywords like waterproof or pressure resistant or that come from content providers whose other non watch advertisements include scuba diving related product SKU s. In embodiments the contextual information may be provided by content providers wireless operators third party databases or may be collected by the monetization platform through activities such as spidering and other content indexing techniques as described herein. The contextual information facility may utilize information relating to user s most recently browsed webpages a user s search result selection inbound and outbound links associated with a content being viewed by a user on his mobile communication facility keywords within a content metadata associated with content and the like.

Referring again to a mobile communication facility may provide behavioral data demographic data and geographic data to the wireless operator the publisher and or the monetization platform server . In another example the behavioral data demographic data and geographic data may be distributed across the publisher wireless operator and the mobile communication facility each providing such data to the monetization platform.

In embodiments the publisher may be associated with an advertisement server through an advertisement network. Moreover the advertisement network may be a performance based network and may allow bidding on advertisements by publishers. Furthermore the advertisement network may be integrated with other servers either by software or by physical communication channel without deviating from the scope of the invention. In addition data integration services may be automatically enabled with other servers outside of the monetization platform.

Referring to a monetization platform may be associated with a publisher s business rules facility . The publisher s business rules facility may include an exception management facility percentage allocation facility predetermined order facility and unique user s facility . The publisher s business rules facility may be associated with a prioritization of content facility that may order the content within a plurality of content inventories based at least in part on a business rule within the publisher s business rules facility . The business rules may be provided by the publisher a wireless operator or may be created by the monetization platform server based on past publisher wireless operator preferences or some other criterion.

In embodiments the exception management facility may facilitate blending of content inventories such as inventory A inventory B inventory C and other inventories. In an example the blending may be based on a predetermined rule such as percentage of content to be selected from different inventories . In another example the exception management facility may include a business rule that requires that all streaming multimedia content be excluded as a relevant content for distribution to a publisher . In another example the exception management facility may include a business rule requiring that content from a specific vendor be given a higher priority for distribution to the publisher.

In embodiments a business rule may be used by a prioritization of content facility to prioritize the content or a subset of the content that is available to the monetization platform server from among the plurality of content inventories . Based at least in part on this prioritization a prioritized ordering facility may rank order the content. This rank order may be further adjusted by the analytics data integration and data mining facility . For example although the prioritized ordering facility may highly rank a given content item the analytics data integration and data mining facility may have stored data indicating that based on past distribution of the content to publishers the item resulted in a low clickthrough rate among users. Thus it may be lowered in the prioritized ordering of content that qualifies under the business rule.

In embodiments a request from a publisher may be received by a monetization platform server and a prioritized ordering of content from a plurality of content inventories may be searched for a content that is the highest ordered relevant content relating to the request. Content may be selected for delivery to the publisher from one or more content inventories . The content may be selected based at least in part on a relevance determination between the prioritized order and the request . Content within the plurality of content inventories and or the monetization platform server may be further associated with an analytics facility that may perform tasks including but not limited to data integration data mining data optimization statistical analysis or some other data function.

In embodiments the exception management facility may contain business rules relating to mobile communication facility device characteristics as described herein. The mobile communication facility device characteristics may include but are not be limited to display size streaming capability model memory and the like. In an example the selected content may be filtered based on display capabilities before forwarding the same to the publisher .

In embodiments the exception management facility may contain business rules relating to content type. For example a business rule may require a file size may restrict content containing particular keywords may include or exclude content providers and the like.

In embodiments the percent allocation facility may contain business rules relating to a minimum revenue expectation of a publisher . For example the percentage allocation may require that content selected for delivery to a publisher be allocated according to a set percentage across different vendors that are included in the plurality of content inventories . For example in response to a publisher s request for sponsored content the percent allocation business rule may require that the prioritization of content facility order the content so that of the top ten ranked content that is selected as relevant to the request X derives from content vendor A Y to vendor B and Z to vendor C. In another example the percentage allocation may be based on the content inventories rather than content providers. In this example content inventories A B and C may all relate to a single content vendor but the percentage allocation rule may require that the prioritization of content facility order the content so that of the top ten ranked content that is relevant to the request X from the vendor s inventory A Y from the vendor s inventory B and Z is from the vendor s inventory C.

In embodiments the predetermined order facility may order content based on a predetermined criteria. For example the predetermined criteria business rule may require that the prioritization of content facility always order content from inventory A above content from inventory B or C. In another example the predetermined order may be based on data relating to a mobile communication facility or its user using any of the data types as described herein such as a user characteristics. For example the predetermined criteria business rule may require that the prioritization of content facility always order content from inventory A above content from inventory B or C for male users but always order content from inventory B above content from inventory A or C if the user is female.

In embodiments the unique user s facility may identify the rules for a specific user based at least in part on information relating to the user using any of the data types as described herein such as a usage history. For example if the user s usage history indicates that the user has previously been provided with a content from a inventory A the unique user business rule may require that the publisher be provided a second content for the user from the same inventory in order to minimize the chances that the user is provided the same content as was previously provided. Alternatively the business rule may require that the publisher be provided a second content for the user from a different inventory than that from which the first content was selected.

In embodiments the monetization platform may provide the publisher access to the publisher s business rules facility through a graphic user interface. The interface may allow the publisher to modify the publisher s business rules .
