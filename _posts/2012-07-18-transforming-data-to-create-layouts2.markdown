Various application programs modules or other types of software can be used to publish visual content or other information. As such data sharing has become commonplace among software users. With respect to visual content in particular users sometimes wish to publish visual content with other types of content such as text or other information in a single published document. For example users may wish to create a flyer a layout a pamphlet a website an advertisement a social networking update an image or the like that includes visual content as well as other content such as text.

Because many users are not well versed in design concepts that can be used to present the data in a meaningful format for viewers the data published by these users may not be readily consumable and or understood by viewers. Additionally visual content sometimes is published quickly without consideration of how the data may best be provided to consumers of the data. As such formats chosen to present visual content or other data may or may not be ideal. In particular the published content may lack a format that allows the data to be useful for viewers. As such challenges exist for publishers and or consumers of visual content due to the increasing volume and frequency of publication of this type of content and the challenges of presenting the visual content in a meaningful way.

Concepts and technologies are described herein for transforming data to create layouts. In accordance with the concepts and technologies disclosed herein a device an application or a technology layer provided by hardware and or software within a computing device can correspond to or provide functionality associated with a layout generator. In some embodiments a computing device executes a layout generator. Via execution of the layout generator the computing device can be configured to receive retrieve or otherwise obtain data. The data can include visual content such as images and other content such as text. The computing device can analyze at least one image included in the data to identify a salient region associated with the image. In some embodiments the computing device also can be configured to analyze the image to identify an invariant region associated with the image.

As used herein the term salient region can be used to refer to a portion of an image that includes what can be considered to be an important portion of the image. For example if image includes people the salient region can be determined to include one or more faces of the people in an image. Similarly the salient region can be identified as buildings in architectural photos flowers or other vividly colored items among trees grass or other relatively monotonously colored backgrounds or the like. In some embodiments the salient region can be identified by the computing device based upon patterns color variances sharpness or blurring facial recognition or other processes. As such the salient region can correspond to an area region or other portion of an image that can be determined to be a focal point or subject of the image. Similarly the term invariant region as used herein can be used to refer to an area region or portion of the image that has a relatively consistent color color scheme color differences luminance sharpness blur pattern or the like that can be determined to be a location at which text included in the data could be located with respect to the image over the invariant region achieving reasonable and consistent contrast between the foreground text and the background image. In some examples the invariant region can correspond to a relatively uniform portion of the image such as a blue sky in a landscape photograph a wall or other background behind human subjects or the like. Salient regions and invariant regions may or may not be mutually exclusive. For example in some cases invariant regions can be contained within the salient regions or can overlap the salient regions.

The computing device can be configured to store or access one or more layout designs designs . The designs can be generated by designers or other entities and stored at a data storage device at or in communication with the computing device. The designs can include a viewport frame that corresponds to and or defines visible limits or extents of a layout or other output to be generated by the layout generator. The designs also can include one or more salient region placement frames defining a location within the layout at which a salient region of the image is to be located. The designs also can include one or more text placement frames defining a location within the layout at which text and or an invariant region of the image is to be located. The computing device can compare the analyzed data to one or more designs to determine if the visual content and or any text included in the data match or are conducive to the use of one or more of the designs. A matching design or a highest ranked design if multiple matching designs are identified can be selected. The computing device can load the data into the selected design to generate the layout.

Layout designs also can be automatically generated by the computing device based at least partially upon predefined rules such as an aspect ratio and or size range of the viewport locations and or sizes of the salient regions frames locations and or sizes of the text placement frames or the like. For example some rules can specify generating design layouts containing a viewport with aspect ratios between 2 and 0.5 with five steps with salient region frames of sizes between 0.1 to 0.5 of the viewport area located on the top left right and or bottom of the viewport. Numbers of possible permutations can be produced via this process which can be used in addition to or instead of stored design layouts as described and illustrated herein. It therefore should be understood that the design layout generation embodiments described and illustrated herein are illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

In generating the layout the computing device can adjust a position of the image within the viewport frame such that a salient region of the image is located within the viewport frame at a position that corresponds to a salient region placement frame associated with the design effectively cropping the original image. Similarly the computing device can adjust a position of the image within the viewport frame such that an invariant region of the image is located within the viewport frame at a position that corresponds to a text placement frame associated with the design. The computing device can place the text at the location of the text placement frame and the computing device can generate or create the layout or other form of the output for viewing printing saving publishing or other activity. If the computing device does not identify a design determined to be a match for the data the computing device can scale scroll pan or otherwise modify the image to match one of the designs. In some embodiments the computing device places the text at a location within the layout that does not overlay the scaled image. As such the computing device can generate a layout whether or not any designs match the salient region and or invariant region of the image.

It should be appreciated that the above described subject matter may be implemented as a computer controlled apparatus a computer process a computing system or as an article of manufacture such as a computer readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.

This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended that this Summary be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.

The following detailed description is directed to concepts and technologies for transforming data to create layouts. According to the concepts and technologies described herein a device such as a computing device can access or execute an application or technology layer that provides a layout generator. The computing device can obtain data that includes visual content such as images and other content such as text. The data can be obtained from an application or device at in communication with and or remote from the computing device. The computing device can analyze one or more images included in the data to identify a salient region of the image. The computing device also can be configured to analyze the image to identify an invariant region associated with the image.

The computing device can be configured to store or access one or more designs and to evaluate the designs to determine if one or more of the designs matches the data obtained by the computing device. The computing device can identify a matching design based upon the determined salient region and or invariant region of the image as well as locations within a matching design of a salient region placement frame and or a text placement frame. In some embodiments the computing device can identify a single design that matches the data and in some other embodiments the computing device can identify a number of designs that match the data. If multiple matching designs are identified the matching designs can be ranked and a highest ranked design can be selected.

The computing device can be configured to load the data into the selected design to generate the layout. In generating the layout the computing device can be configured to transform the data by cropping scaling panning scrolling extending infilling seam carving and or otherwise modifying visual content included in the data as well as overlaying the image with the text included in the data. If a design that accommodates the visual content and the text cannot be identified by the computing device the computing device can transform the data by scaling and or shifting the image and placing the text outside of the image to generate the layout. The generated layout can be output by the computing device for storage viewing publishing or other uses.

Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject matter described herein may be practiced with other computer system configurations including hand held devices multiprocessor systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics minicomputers mainframe computers and the like.

In the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples. Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals represent like elements throughout the several figures aspects of a computing system computer readable storage medium and computer implemented methodology for transforming data to create layouts will be presented.

Referring now to aspects of one operating environment for the various embodiments presented herein will be described. The operating environment shown in can include a computing device . According to various embodiments the functionality of the computing device can be provided by a personal computer PC such as a desktop tablet workstation or laptop computer system. The functionality of the computing device also can be provided by other types of computing systems including but not limited to server computers handheld computers netbook computers notebook computers embedded computer systems personal digital assistants mobile telephones tablet or slate computers smart phones or other devices or systems capable of executing the various software elements described herein. Because other computing systems can be used to provide the functionality described herein the above examples of the computing device should be understood as being illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

According to some embodiments the computing device is configured to operate in communication with or as a part of a communications network network . In some other embodiments the computing device does not operate in communication with the network and or functionality of the computing device described herein can be provided without accessing the network . The computing device can be configured to execute an operating system and one or more application programs modules software elements or other computer executable or computer executable instructions such as for example a layout generator and or other computer executable instructions.

The operating system is a computer program for controlling the operation of the computing device . The layout generator can include an executable program configured to execute on top of the operating system to provide the functionality described herein for creating layouts. Although the layout generator is illustrated as a component of the computing device it should be understood that the layout generator may be embodied as or in a stand alone device or components thereof operating as part of or in communication with the network and or the computing device . The layout generator also can be a virtualized service or technology layer that executes on the computing device and or on other real or virtual devices in communication with the computing device . Thus the illustrated embodiment is illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

As will be explained in more detail below the layout generator can be configured to obtain data . The data obtained by the layout generator can include visual content such as one or more images video or the like as well as other content such as text to be presented with the visual content. For purposes of illustrating and describing the concepts and technologies disclosed herein the visual content is referred to herein as images. Because types of visual content are contemplated and are possible it should be understood that this embodiment is illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The layout generator can analyze at least one image included in the data to identify one or more salient regions of the image. As used herein the term salient region can be used to refer to a portion of an image that is determined to be an important portion of the image a focal point of the image a subject of the image or the like. The layout generator can identify a salient region based upon color differences at near or within the salient region color or texture patters at near or within the salient region facial recognition object recognition brightness and or metering data blurring or sharpness at near or within the salient region color distributions at near or within the salient region or the like. For example the layout generator can identify a salient region corresponding to a face in an image that includes a person. It should be understood that in some embodiments the layout generator can identify multiple salient regions in a particular image. Because other approaches for identifying one or more salient regions are contemplated it should be understood that these embodiments are illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The layout generator also can analyze at least one image to identify one or more invariant regions of the image. The term invariant region as used herein can be used to refer to a portion of an image that is determined by the layout generator to correspond to a location conducive for text placement to include constant or relatively relative to other portions of the image constant coloring luminance patterns sharpness brightness contrast textures or the like. For example if an image includes a subject such as a person or building surrounded by a relatively solid color background such as a blue sky with wispy white clouds a field a wall or the like the layout generator may designate the background as an invariant region. As such the background can correspond to a location within the image onto which text can be overlaid or located. In particular the layout generator can be configured to place text at a location corresponding to the invariant region of the image such that the text can be easy to read relative to text placed on top of a varying background or foreground . An example of identifying an invariant region is set forth below in detail with reference to . Because other approaches for identifying invariant regions are contemplated it should be understood that these embodiments are illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

The layout generator can be configured to identify salient regions and or invariant regions within an image or other visual content included in the data . The layout generator also can be configured to generate store access and or use one or more designs . The designs can correspond to frames or guides for generating layout or output . In particular the layout generator can use the designs as rules or guides for transforming one or more images and one or more instances of text in the data into a layout or other form of the output . According to various embodiments the designs include a viewport frame that can define visible limits or extents of a layout or other form of the output one or more salient region placement frames that define a location within the layout or other form of the output at which a salient region of the image is to be located and one or more text placement frames that define a location within the layout or other form of the output at which an invariant region of the image and or the text included in the data is are to be located in the output .

The layout generator can be configured to determine based upon an analysis of the data one of the designs into which the data can be loaded and to create the output by loading the data into the determined and or selected design . As will be explained in more detail herein the designs can include grid based image and text design layouts that can be created to approximate a number of contemplated design scenarios. The layout generator can be configured to determine based upon the data which of the designs is to be used to create the output and or how to modify the data if a design is not identified for the data . If the layout generator identifies multiple designs that can be used to create the output the layout generator can be configured to rank the possible designs and select a highest ranked design of the possible designs . The designs the selection of a design and the application of the data to the chosen design will be described in more detail below particularly with reference to .

According to various embodiments the computing device can be configured to create generate receive and or store the data . For example the data can be stored at the computing device in a memory disk drive or other data storage elements. In some other embodiments such as the embodiment illustrated in the data can be obtained from a data source that can be configured to operate as part of or in communication with the network . The functionality of the data source can be provided by a network drive a server computer operating on or in communication with the network a database or other real or virtual data storage elements and or other data storage devices. In some embodiments wherein the layout generator operates a technology layer within the computing device the data can be obtained from an application or storage device and loaded into or otherwise provided to the layout generator . As such it should be understood that the illustrated and described embodiments of the operating environment are illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

According to various aspects of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein the layout generator can be included as part of one or more applications programs software computer executable instructions and or other data or can be provided as a technology layer executing on the computing device and or elsewhere to modify content generated by the one or more instances of computer executable instructions. The various aspects of the layout generator described herein can be provided by a single or multiple applications or modules. Thus the computing device can by execution of the layout generator receive the data determine a design into which to load the data identify one or more salient region s and or one or more invariant region s within an image included in the data load the data into the determined design and generate the output .

Some or all of the designs can be associated with or have associated with the designs a set of rules for applying the data to the designs . The rules can define how the data is applied to a particular design . As mentioned above the rules can be embodied as a viewport frame one or more salient region placement frames and or one or more text placement frames. The computing device can be configured to load the data into a selected design based upon the rules associated with the design . The computing device can be configured to display the output for a user or other entity or to store the output at a data storage device if desired.

According to some embodiments of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein the computing device also is configured to obtain and apply user feedback to the designs and or to the output . In some embodiments the computing device can prompt for and or receive without prompting user feedback. The feedback can include user responses to various prompts or questions. For example the computing device can present questions to a user or other entity for evaluating various aspects of the output . In some embodiments the computing device asks or prompts a user or other entity for feedback regarding layouts text placement scales and or positions of images element locations image sizes or other aspects of the output by expressing whether that particular aspect is liked or disliked. Based upon the expressed likes and or dislikes the computing device can be configured to update the output and or to modify one or more of the designs . The computing device also can be configured to generate a new design based upon the feedback if desired.

It should be understood that the computing device can prompt a user if a particular aspect of the output is liked or disliked good or bad or the like. The feedback questions prompts or the like can be formatted as questions with binary yes no like dislike or true false answers. The questions or prompts also can request rankings over various ranges such as for example scales of numbers such as one to ten one to one hundred letter grades such as A through F numbers of stars or the like. The user can provide this and or other types of feedback with respect to the entirety of the output and or the computing device can be configured to ask the user to express this feedback regarding individual parts or components of the output . For example the computing device can be configured to ask if the output is liked or disliked or to ask if a particular aspect or component of the output is liked or disliked. Because other approaches for expressing likes and or dislikes with respect to the output are possible and are contemplated it should be understood that these embodiments are illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

Turning now to a line diagram showing aspects of an image and the identification of a salient region and or an invariant region will be described according to an illustrative embodiment. shows an illustrative sample image image . It should be appreciated that the image illustrated in is illustrative of one example embodiment and therefore should not be construed as being limited in any way.

As shown in the image can include multiple people faces or other subjects people . It can be appreciated that the example image is provided only for purposes of illustration. As such the people are merely illustrative of one contemplated embodiment of an image subject and should not be construed as being limiting in any way. Although not necessarily present in every instance of visual content such as the image the image includes empty space areas empty space . As used herein the term empty space can refer to space within an image such as the image that is not occupied or is only partially occupied by important or salient aspects of the image . As such the empty space can include but is not limited to an invariant region of an image as described herein. For example the empty space can include a region or portion of the image that has substantially constant coloring color distribution luminance patterns textures sharpness blurring brightness contract or the like. The above examples of identifying the empty space should be understood as being illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

In accordance with some embodiments of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein the computing device can be configured to identify the people and or one or more portions thereof as corresponding to a salient region as described above. In particular the faces of the people can be determined to correspond to a salient region of the image by the computing device and or the layout generator . In some embodiments the computing device can identify a region that encompasses all of the faces a portion of each of the faces and or a portion of one or more of the faces as corresponding to the salient region. It should be understood that this embodiment is illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

Similarly the computing device can identify one or more of the empty spaces and or portions thereof as corresponding to an invariant region as explained above. Thus the computing device can be configured to determine that an invariant region corresponding to the empty spaces may be used for placement of text or the like when the layout or other form of the output is generated. Several example designs and loading data into the designs are illustrated and described below in more detail with reference to .

Turning now to additional aspects of the designs are illustrated according to some illustrative embodiments. According to various embodiments of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein a library of designs can be maintained and or accessed by the computing device . The library of designs can include any number of designs . As such the illustrated embodiments are provided only for illustration of various aspects of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

Referring to an example design is schematically illustrated as having a grid based layout design A. The grid based layout design A includes a viewport frame that can correspond to the limits or extents of the desired layout. Thus the viewport frame can correspond to the viewable portion of the layout or other output generated by the layout generator . The grid based layout design A also includes two salient region placement frames .

The salient region placement frames can correspond to a placement area region or location for a salient region of an image within the output generated by the layout generator . Thus the salient region placement frames can correspond to an area or region at which the salient region of an image is to be placed or located within a visible portion of a layout or other form of output . As mentioned above the visible limits of the layout or other form of the output can be defined by the viewport frame . The grid based layout design A is illustrated in as including two salient region placement frames . It should be understood however that the designs can include less than two salient region placement frames two salient region placement frames and or more than two salient region placement frames . As such the illustrated embodiment should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

It further can be appreciated with reference to that one or more of the salient region placement frames can extend out of the viewable space of the output as defined by the viewport frame . During generation of the output the image or other visual content can be panned scrolled moved and or otherwise located with respect to the viewport frame such that a portion of the salient region of the image can be located at the location corresponding to one or more of the salient region placement frames . As such the image may be located with respect to the viewport frame such that a portion of the image may extend beyond the viewport frame .

Similarly because an image can include more than one salient region it should be understood that the layout generator can be configured to place one or more salient regions of the image at one or more of the salient region placement frames . As such one or more of the salient regions of an image may or may not be placed at locations that correspond to the salient region placement frames shown in . An example method for applying the data to the design and placement of a salient region of an image included in the data at the salient region placement frames is set forth below in more detail in .

Referring now to another example design is schematically illustrated as having a grid based layout design B. The grid based layout design B includes the viewport frame . It should be understood that while the viewport frame is illustrated as being rectangular and as having particular dimensions and or a particular dimension ratio and or orientation that the viewport frame can have other shapes other dimensions other dimension ratios and or other orientations. As such the illustrated embodiment should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

As shown in the grid based layout design B includes two salient region placement frames as described above. The grid based layout design B also includes a text placement frame that can correspond to an area region or other location within an image at which text is to be placed by the layout generator during creation of the output . As can be appreciated from the above description of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein the text placement frame can correspond to and or overlap an invariant region that can be identified by the layout generator though this is not necessarily the case.

The layout generator can be configured to identify one or more invariant regions within an image and to locate the invariant regions of the image at or near the text placement frames if desired. Similarly the layout generator can identify one or more salient regions of the image or other visual content and can locate the one or more salient regions at or near the salient region placement frames . The layout generator also can place text at or near the text placement frame . Although only one text placement frame is shown in it should be understood that a design can include multiple text placement frames . As such it should be understood that the illustrated embodiment is illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

Referring now to another example design is schematically illustrated as having a grid based layout design C. The grid based layout design C can include the viewport frame . Again it should be understood that the illustrated dimensions dimension ratio and or orientation are illustrative and that the viewport frame can have other shapes other dimensions other dimension ratios and or other orientations.

As shown in the grid based layout design C includes two salient region placement frames as described above. As shown in the salient region placement frames can be arranged such that one or more of the salient region placement frames overlap one another in a particular design . Additionally the grid based layout design C includes two text placement frames . As shown one or more of the text placement frames can overlap one or more of the salient region placement frame in some designs . Although two salient region placement frames and two text placement frames are shown in it should be understood that a design can include less than two salient region placement frames two salient region placement frames more than two salient region placement frames less than two text placement frames two text placement frames and or more than two text placement frames . As such it should be understood that this embodiment is illustrative and should not be construed as being limiting in any way.

In operation of the layout generator the data can be received or retrieved at the computing device for generation of a layout or other form of output . The layout generator executed by the computing device can analyze the data . During analysis of the data the layout generator can determine if any text is to be included in the output . The layout generator also can analyze an image included in the data to identify one or more salient regions within the image and or one or more invariant regions within the image.

The layout generator can search the designs for a design that matches or approximates the determined salient regions invariant regions and or text associated with the data . If no match is found by the layout generator the layout generator can scale pan and or otherwise modify the image and or text associated with the data to attempt to find a match for the data among the designs as will be explained in more detail below with reference to . The layout generator thus can perform an initial search of the designs for a match and or can modify the data and perform subsequent searches of the designs . If the layout generator identifies a design that matches or approximates the data the layout generator can load the data into the design and generate the output . If multiple matching designs are identified the matching designs can be ranked and a highest ranked design can be selected.

During loading the data into the design the layout generator can pan scale scroll and or otherwise move an image relative to the design such that one or more salient region of the image is located at or near a salient region placement frame associated with the particular design . The layout generator also can locate text if any at or near the text placement frame associated with the particular design . The layout or other output can be generated by the layout generator . These and other aspects of the transformation of data into a layout will be described in more detail below with reference to .

Turning now to aspects of a method for creating layouts will be described in detail. It should be understood that the operations of the method disclosed herein are not necessarily presented in any particular order and that performance of some or all of the operations in an alternative order s is possible and is contemplated. The operations have been presented in the demonstrated order for ease of description and illustration. Operations may be added omitted and or performed simultaneously without departing from the scope of the appended claims.

It also should be understood that the illustrated method can be ended at any time and need not be performed in its entirety. Some or all operations of the method and or substantially equivalent operations can be performed by execution of computer readable instructions included on a computer storage media as defined herein. The term computer readable instructions and variants thereof as used in the description and claims is used expansively herein to include routines applications application modules program modules programs components data structures algorithms and the like. Computer readable instructions can be implemented on various system configurations including single processor or multiprocessor systems minicomputers mainframe computers personal computers hand held computing devices microprocessor based programmable consumer electronics combinations thereof and the like.

Thus it should be appreciated that the logical operations described herein are implemented 1 as a sequence of computer implemented acts or program modules running on a computing system and or 2 as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within the computing system. The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance and other requirements of the computing system. Accordingly the logical operations described herein are referred to variously as states operations structural devices acts or modules. These operations structural devices acts and modules may be implemented in software in firmware in special purpose digital logic and any combination thereof.

For purposes of illustrating and describing the concepts of the present disclosure the method disclosed herein is described as being performed by the computing device via execution of one or more applications modules or other computer executable instructions such as the layout generator . Because additional or alternative devices can execute the functionality described herein via execution of other applications modules or computer executable instructions it should be understood that this embodiment is illustrative and should not be viewed as being limiting in any way.

The method begins at operation wherein the computing device analyzes the data . The data can be received retrieved and or otherwise obtained by the computing device as explained above from a memory or other local or remote data storage device from a locally or remotely executing application or other software and or from other computing systems or devices such as server computers databases or the like.

During the analysis of the data the computing device can identify an image or other visual content included in the data . If the data does not include any visual content the computing device can obtain other data and or the method can end. The computing device can analyze the one or more images or other visual content included in the data to identify one or more salient regions within the images. The computing device also can identify one or more invariant regions within the images. The computing device also can determine if the data includes text or other information for including in the layout or other form of the output . Although not shown in the computing device can be configured to present a user interface for obtaining text to be included in the layout. As such the computing device can be configured to prompt for and obtain the text instead of or in addition to obtaining the data that includes the text and the visual content.

From operation the method proceeds to operation wherein the computing device can determine if the data matches a design that is available to the computing device . As used herein the computing device can determine that the data matches a design if a particular design includes a salient region placement frame and or a text placement frame that can be used with the data . If a salient region of an image is too big to fit in a salient region placement frame defined by a particular design that design may be determined by the computing device not to match the data . If however the salient region of the image is sized such that the salient region of the image will fit in the salient region placement frame the particular design may at least partially match the data subject to the determination that the invariant region of the image matches the text placement frame defined by the design .

If the computing device determines that a salient region of the image matches the salient region placement frame of the design and that a text placement frame of a design is located at a location within the layout that is at or near an invariant region of the image when the salient region of the image is placed at the salient region placement frame the computing device can determine that the design matches the data . Conversely if a text placement frame of a design is located at a location within the layout that is not at or near an invariant region of the image when the salient region of the image is placed at the salient region placement frame the computing device can determine that the design does not match the data .

As explained above the computing device can maintain or access a library of designs that can be stored at the computing device and or at a location remote from the computing device .
