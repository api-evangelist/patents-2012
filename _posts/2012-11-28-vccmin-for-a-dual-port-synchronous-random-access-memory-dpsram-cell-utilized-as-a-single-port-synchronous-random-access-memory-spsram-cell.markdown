Generally a dual port synchronous random access memory DPSRAM cell comprises one or more transistors. For example the DPSRAM cell comprises pull up transistors pull down transistors and pass gate transistors. Additionally the DPSRAM cell is connected to a first word line a second word line a first bit line or a second bit line. However in some scenarios when a first DPSRAM cell has a desirable write margin WM or a desirable alpha ratio a second DPSRAM cell is associated with a poor static noise margin SNM or a poor beta ratio thus resulting in potential data corruption in the second DPSRAM cell. In other words in some scenarios the SNM and the WM are traditionally related by an inverse proportional relationship such that if one improves the other is worsened. For example a desirable SNM generally leads to an undesirable WM and vice versa. Therefore traditional DPSRAM cells are designed at a SNM WM balance point such that neither the SNM nor the WM is optimal.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to be an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In some embodiments Vccmin for a dual port synchronous random access memory DPSRAM cell utilized as a single port synchronous random access memory SPSRAM cell is improved by sending a second word line signal to a second word line of the DPSRAM cell in response to at least one of a logical low at a first bit line or a logical low at a second bit line. In some examples the first bit line is connected to a source of a first pass gate transistor and the second bit line is connected to a drain of a second pass gate transistor. In this way Vccmin for the DPSRAM cell is improved at least because a beta ratio associated with the DPSRAM cell is determined such that a pass gate transistor does not significantly impact the beta ratio when the second word line signal is sent in response to the logical low at the first bit line or the second bit line.

In some embodiments Vccmin for a dual port synchronous random access memory DPSRAM cell utilized as a single port synchronous random access memory SPSRAM cell is improved by selecting at least one of a channel width a channel length or a channel width to channel length ratio for at least one of a first pull up transistor a second pull up transistor a first pull down transistor a second pull down transistor a first pass gate transistor a second pass gate transistor a third pass gate transistor or a fourth pass gate transistor of the DPSRAM cell. In some examples this selection is based on a second word line signal sent to a second word line of the DPSRAM cell in response to at least one of a logical low at a first bit line or a logical low at a second bit line. In this way Vccmin for the DPSRAM cell is improved at least because such transistors are independently sized rather than requiring a balance between a static noise margin SNM and a write margin WM .

In some embodiments Vccmin for a dual port synchronous random access memory DPSRAM cell utilized as a single port synchronous random access memory SPSRAM cell is improved by selecting a number of DPSRAM cells for a first bit line of a DPSRAM cell array based on a pull down time associated with a change in a first bit line level of the first bit line in response to a first word line signal sent to a first word line. In some embodiments a DPSRAM cell of the DPSRAM cell array is connected to the first word line and the first bit line via a first pass gate transistor. In this way Vccmin for the DPSRAM cell is improved at least because a timing associated with the first bit line is controlled based on the number of DPSRAM cells selected for the first bit line.

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects are employed. Other aspects advantages or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It is evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Generally a synchronous random access memory DPSRAM cell is associated with a Vccmin voltage. For example a minimum voltage at which the DPSRAM cell operates reliably is the Vccmin voltage. Accordingly an improvement in a write margin WM or associated alpha ratio is generally associated with an improvement or decrease in the Vccmin voltage. In other words a lower Vccmin is associated with a desirable WM. Traditionally however the improvement in the WM leads to a worse static noise margin SNM or a lower beta ratio. In some embodiments a turn on sequence associated with a word line and a bit line of the DPSRAM cell is controlled such that the improvement in the WM yields an improved SNM thereby improving Vccmin for the DPSRAM cell utilized as a single port synchronous random access memory SPSRAM cell. In other words the DPSRAM cell achieves a desirable SNM a desirable or larger beta ratio a desirable WM or a desirable or smaller alpha ratio by controlling a turn on sequence associated with a word line and a bit line of the DPSRAM cell. For example as the beta ratio increases the SNM becomes more desirable decreasing the Vccmin voltage thus reducing Vccmin accordingly. Generally desirable to decrease the alpha ratio associated with a DPSRAM cell performing a write operation. In some embodiments it will be appreciated that an associated MUX N design is implemented for example.

In some embodiments the positive supply voltage is Vdd for example. In some embodiments a source of the first pull down transistor and a source of the second pull down transistor are connected to a negative supply voltage . In some embodiments the negative supply voltage is Vss or ground for example.

In some embodiments the drain of the first pull up transistor is connected to the drain of first pass gate transistor the drain of the third pass gate transistor the drain of the first pull down transistor the gate of the second pull up transistor and the gate of the second pull down transistor . In some embodiments the drain of the second pull up transistor is connected to the source of the second pass gate transistor the source of the fourth pass gate transistor the drain of the second pull down transistor the gate of the first pull up transistor and the gate of the first pull down transistor . In some embodiments the drain of the first pull down transistor is connected to the drain of first pass gate transistor the drain of the third pass gate transistor the drain of the first pull up transistor the gate of the second pull up transistor and the gate of the second pull down transistor . In some embodiments the drain of the second pull down transistor is connected to the source of the second pass gate transistor the source of the fourth pass gate transistor the drain of the second pull up transistor the gate of the first pull up transistor and the gate of the first pull down transistor .

In some embodiments the gate of the first pull up transistor is connected to the gate of the first pull down transistor the drain of the second pull up transistor the drain of the second pull down transistor the source of the second pass gate transistor and the source of the fourth pass gate transistor . In some embodiments the gate of the second pull up transistor is connected to the gate of the second pull down transistor the drain of the first pull up transistor the drain of the first pull down transistor the drain of the first pass gate transistor and the drain of the third pass gate transistor . In some embodiments the gate of the third pull up transistor is connected to the gate of the first pull up transistor the drain of the second pull up transistor the drain of the second pull down transistor the source of the second pass gate transistor and the source of the fourth pass gate transistor .

In some embodiments a first word line signal is sent to the first word line of the DPSRAM cell. Additionally a second word line signal is sent to the second word line of the DPSRAM cell in response to at least one of a logical low at the first bit line or a logical low at the second bit line . In other words the second word line signal is sent to the second word line of the DPSRAM cell after at least one of a logical low at the first bit line is detected or a logical low at the second bit line is detected for example. When the first word line signal is sent to the first word line at least one of the first pass gate transistor or the second pass gate transistor is turned on at least because the gate of the first pass gate transistor and the gate of the second pass gate transistor are biased to a logical high based on the first word line signal sent to the first word line . Therefore at least one of the first bit line or the second bit line drops from the logical high to a logical low when the first word line signal is sent at least because at least one of the first pass gate transistor or the second pass gate transistor is switched on connecting at least one of the first bit line or the second bit line to ground via the first pull down transistor or the second pull down transistor respectively. Accordingly when the first pass gate transistor or the second pass gate transistor is connected to ground for a time sufficient to enable at least one of the first bit line or the second bit line to fall to a logical low an impact of a pass gate is mitigated with respect to a beta ratio associated with the DPSRAM cell. For example if PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pass gate transistor and PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pull down transistor PD PG rather than PD PG PG when the second word line signal is sent to the second word line of the DPSRAM cell before at least one of a logical low at the first bit line is detected or a logical low at the second bit line is detected for example.

In some embodiments respective transistors of are associated with a channel width a channel length or a channel width to channel length ratio. For example the third pull up transistor is associated with a third pull up transistor ratio equal to a channel width of the third pull up transistor divided by a channel length of the third pull up transistor . In some embodiments the channel width to channel length ratio of at least some of the first pass gate transistor the second pass gate transistor the third pass gate transistor the fourth pass gate transistor the fifth pass gate transistor the sixth pass gate transistor the seventh pass gate transistor or the eighth pass gate transistor are substantially the same.

In some embodiments the first DPSRAM cell performs a read operation and the second DPSRAM cell performs a dummy read operation. For example a first word line signal is sent to a first word line . In some examples sending the first word line signal to the first word line comprises sending a logical high to the first word line . Accordingly the first word line is connected to the first DPSRAM cell and the second DPSRAM cell . For example the first word line is connected to a gate of the first pass gate transistor a gate of the second pass gate transistor a gate of the fifth pass gate transistor a gate of the sixth pass gate transistor . When the first DPSRAM cell performs the read operation and the second DPSRAM cell performs the dummy read operation merely the first word line signal is sent to the first word line . In other words a second word line is off or is not sent a second word line signal for example. Therefore a static noise margin SNM associated with the first DPSRAM cell and a SNM associated with the second DPSRAM cell are both desirable at least because the second word line is off.

In some examples PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pull down transistor PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pull down transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pass gate transistor and PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pass gate transistor .

Similarly PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the third pull down transistor PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pull down transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fifth pass gate transistor and PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the sixth pass gate transistor .

In some embodiments the first DPSRAM cell performs a dummy read operation and the second DPSRAM cell performs a write operation. For example a first word line signal is sent to a first word line such as by sending a logical high to the first word line . Accordingly the first word line is connected to the first DPSRAM cell and the second DPSRAM cell . For example the first word line is connected to a gate of the first pass gate transistor a gate of the second pass gate transistor a gate of the fifth pass gate transistor a gate of the sixth pass gate transistor . When the first DPSRAM cell performs the write operation the second word line signal is sent to the second word line . According to some aspects the second word line signal is sent to the second word line sending a logical high to the second word line for example.

In some examples PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pull up transistor PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pull up transistor PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the third pull up transistor PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pull up transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the third pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fifth pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the sixth pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the seventh pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the eighth pass gate transistor PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pull down transistor and PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pull down transistor PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the third pull down transistor and PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pull down transistor .

Accordingly an alpha ratio associated with the second DPSRAM cell when the first word line signal is sent to the first word line and no signal is sent to the second word line is at least one of 35 or 46.

The alpha ratio associated with the second DPSRAM cell when the first word line signal is sent to the first word line and the second word line signal is sent to the second word line after at least one of detecting a logical low in a first bit line or detecting a logical low in a second bit line is at least one of 3 57 or 4 68 .

In some embodiments a beta ratio associated with the first DPSRAM cell when the first word line signal is sent to the first word line and no signal is sent to the second word line is at least one of 11 or 22.

The beta ratio associated with the first DPSRAM cell when the first word line signal is sent to the first word line and the second word line signal is sent to the second word line after at least one of detecting a logical low in a first bit line or detecting a logical low in a second bit line is at least one of 13 or 24.

For example when the second word line signal is sent to the second word line after at least one of detecting a logical low in a first bit line or detecting a logical low in a second bit line a write margin WM or alpha ratio associated with the second DPSRAM cell is desirable and a static noise margin SNM or beta ratio associated with the first DPSRAM cell is desirable at least because at least one of the first bit line or the second bit line is discharged for example.

In some embodiments a second word line signal is sent to a second word line in response to a voltage difference between the first bit line and the second bit line . In other words the second word line is sent to the second word line when at least one of the first bit line is at a logical high and the second bit line is at a logical low or vice versa.

In some embodiments a number of DPSRAM cells is selected or connected to a bit line to control a response time associated with at least one of the first bit line falling to the logical low or the second bit line falling to the logical low. For example when fewer DPSRAM cells are connected to a bit line the response time associated with the bit line falling to the logical low is decreased. Conversely when more DPSRAM cells are connected to the bit line the response time associated with the bit line falling to the logical low is increased.

In some embodiments at least one of the first DPSRAM cell or the second DPSRAM cell performs a read modify write operation to facilitate a decrease in response time associated with at least one of the first bit line falling to the logical low or the second bit line falling to the logical low. In some examples the read modify write is performed in response to a first word line signal sent to a first word line for example. For example the read modify write operation is performed based on at least one of a number of DPSRAM cells connected to the first bit line in a DPSRAM cell array or a number of DPSRAM cells connected to the second bit line in the DPSRAM cell array. In some embodiments the second word line signal is sent to the second word line of the DPSRAM cell in response to the read modify write operation for example.

In some embodiments at least one of a read or a dummy read performed by at least one of the first DPSRAM cell or the second DPSRAM cell is based on differential sensing associated with at least one of the first bit line the second bit line the third bit line the fourth bit line the fifth bit line the sixth bit line the seventh bit line or the eighth bit line .

It will be appreciated that in some embodiments the fifth bit line is a first bit line of the second DPSRAM cell the sixth bit line is a second bit line of the second DPSRAM cell the seventh bit line is a third bit line of the second DPSRAM cell or the eighth bit line is a fourth bit line of the second DPSRAM cell . Similarly in some embodiments the third pull up transistor is a first pull up transistor of the second DPSRAM cell the fourth pull up transistor is a second pull up transistor of the second DPSRAM cell the third pull down transistor is a first pull down transistor of the second DPSRAM cell the fourth pull down transistor is a second pull down transistor of the second DPSRAM cell the fifth pass gate transistor is a first pass gate transistor of the second DPSRAM cell the sixth pass gate transistor is a second pass gate transistor of the second DPSRAM cell the seventh pass gate transistor is a third pass gate transistor of the second DPSRAM cell and the eighth pass gate transistor is a fourth pass gate transistor of the second DPSRAM cell etc.

In some examples according to and PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pull up transistor PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pull up transistor PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the third pull up transistor PU is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pull up transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the third pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fifth pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the sixth pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the seventh pass gate transistor PG is a channel width to channel length ratio for the eighth pass gate transistor PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the first pull down transistor and PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the second pull down transistor PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the third pull down transistor and PD is a channel width to channel length ratio for the fourth pull down transistor .

In this example an alpha ratio associated with the second DPSRAM cell at time T is at least one of 35 or 46.

In some embodiments a beta ratio associated with the first DPSRAM cell at time T is at least one of 11 or 22.

In this way a desirable write margin WM or desirable alpha ratio associated with the second DPSRAM cell is provided. Similarly a desirable static noise margin SNM or a desirable beta ratio associated with the first DPSRAM cell is provided at least because at least one of the first bit line or the second bit line is discharged for example.

In some embodiments a number of DPSRAM cells is selected or connected to a bit line based on a response time associated with a bit line level falling from a logical high to a logical low. For example a fourth DPSRAM cell is connected to at least one of the fifth bit line the sixth bit line the seventh bit line or the eighth bit line . Similarly additional DPSRAM cells are connected until a desired number of DPSRAM cells are connected to respective bit lines for example. The desired number of DPSRAM cells is associated with a response time for a bit line of the respective bit lines to fall to a logical low level when at least one of the DPSRAM cells connected to the respective bit lines is performing a dummy read for example. In other words a greater number of DPSRAM cells connected to the respective bit lines is associated with an increase in response time while a fewer number of DPSRAM cells connected to the respective bit lines is associated with a decrease in response time for example.

In some embodiments the first word line signal is sent to the first word line of the DPSRAM cell by at least one of biasing the gate of the first pass gate transistor or biasing the gate of the second pass gate transistor. Similarly the second word line signal is sent to the second word line of the DPSRAM cell by at least one of biasing the gate of the third pass gate transistor or biasing the gate of the fourth pass gate transistor.

In some embodiments the first bit line is connected to a drain of a first pull down transistor based on the first word line signal. For example when the first word line signal is sent to the first word line the gate of the first pass gate transistor such as the first pass gate transistor of is biased thus turning the first pass gate transistor on to connect the first bit line to the drain of the first pull down transistor such as the first pull down transistor of . Similarly the second bit line is connected to a drain of a second pull down transistor based on the first word line signal. For example when the first word line signal is sent to the first word line the gate of the second pass gate transistor such as the second pass gate transistor of is biased thus turning the second pass gate transistor on to connect the second bit line to the drain of the second pull down transistor such as the second pull down transistor of .
