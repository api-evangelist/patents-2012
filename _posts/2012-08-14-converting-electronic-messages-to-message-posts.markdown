The subject technology relates generally to social networks namely discussion threads. Some users may be slow to adopt use of the tools provided by social networks. For example a user who may otherwise converse with many friends via an electronic message may not connect with those friends in a social network. Even if the user is a member of the social network the user s message feed may remain relatively empty thereby slowing the adoption of the social network to read or post messages.

The subject technology provides a device and method for converting electronic messages to message posts. A computer implemented method may include receiving a first system an electronic message designated for one or more recipients determining that the one or more recipients are members of a social network associated with a sender of the electronic message identifying one or more social groups in the social network for the one or more recipients converting at least a portion of the electronic message to a message post and providing in a second system the message post to a message stream associated with the one or more social groups wherein the second system is associated with the social network. Other aspects include corresponding systems apparatus and computer program products for implementation of the computer implemented method.

The previously described aspects and other aspects may include one or more of the following features. For example identifying one or more social groups may include determining that the one or more recipients are members of a plurality of social groups and providing the plurality of social groups to the sender for selection wherein the one or more identified social groups are selected by the sender from the plurality of social groups. Identifying one or more social groups may include determining that the one or more recipients are in a predefined social group related to the sender and providing the message post to the message stream for display to only members of the predefined social group. Identifying one or more social groups may include determining that the one or more recipients are not in a predefined social group related to the sender and prompting the sender to add the one or more recipients to a user defined social group. Identifying one or more social groups may include determining that the one or more recipients are not in a predefined social group related to the sender and associating the recipients with a default social group if the sender has sent more than a predetermined number of electronic messages to the recipients. The electronic message may be further designated for other recipients. In this regard identifying one or more social groups may include determining that the one or more recipients are not in a predefined social group related to the sender determining that the other recipients of the electronic message are in a user defined social group and that the one or more recipients were included in electronic messages to the other recipients on at least a predetermined number of other occasions and associating the one or more recipients with the user defined social group.

The method may also include determining that the one or more recipients are not communicatively connected with the sender in the social network and sending a request to the one or more recipients to connect with the sender. The method may further include providing at least a portion of a message body of the electronic message as content of the message post and providing at least a portion of a message subject of the electronic message as a heading of the message post. In this regard converting the electronic message to the message post may include providing an attachment received with the electronic message as an attachment to the message post. Additionally or in the alternative the portion of the message body may include one or more links to one or more resources stored at a remote location. In this regard the method may further include formatting the content of the message post to display the one or more links as they are displayed by the message body. Additionally or in the alternative the portion of the message body may include a representation of one or more videos or images. In this regard the method may further include formatting the content of the message post to display one or more preview icons corresponding to the one or more videos or images.

The method may further include receiving an indication that the electronic message was forwarded by a forwarding recipient and providing an indication that the forwarding recipient shared the message post. The method may also include receiving a reply related to the electronic message from a replying recipient receiving an indication from the replying recipient to provide the reply to the message stream and providing at least the portion of the reply to the message stream as a reply post to the message post. In this regard the method may include in response to receiving the reply prompting the replying recipient to post the reply to the message stream wherein the indication is received in response to the prompting.

In another aspect a system may include a processor and a memory. The memory may include instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to facilitate receiving from a first system an electronic message designated for one or more recipients facilitate making a determination that the one or more recipients are members of an online social network associated with a sender of the electronic message and in response to making the determination facilitate converting at least a portion of a message body to the electronic message and providing for display the message post to the one or more recipients in a second system wherein the second system is associated with the social network. Other aspects include corresponding methods apparatus and computer program products.

The previously described aspects and other aspects may include one or more of the following features. For example causing the processor to facilitate making the determination that the one or more recipients are members comprises may cause the processor to facilitate processing one or more address fields of a message header related to the electronic message to determine one or more electronic addresses corresponding to the one or more recipients and facilitate making a determination that the one or more electronic addresses are associated with one or more corresponding members of the social network.

At least a portion of a subject of the electronic message may be provided with the message body as a heading of the message post. An attachment received with the electronic message may be provided with the message body as an attachment to the message post. The instructions when executed may further cause the processor to facilitate making a determination that the one or more recipients are in a predefined social group related to the sender and facilitate providing the message post for display to only members of the predefined social group. Additionally or in the alternative the instructions when executed further cause the processor to facilitate making a first determination that one or more first recipients of the electronic message are not in a predefined social group related to the sender facilitate making a second determination that one or more second recipients are in a predefined social group defined by the sender and that the sender has sent other electronic messages to the first recipients and facilitate in response to the first determination and second determination adding the one or more first recipients to the predetermined social group. The instructions when executed may further cause the processor to facilitate making a determination that the one or more recipients are not in a predefined social group related to the sender if a default group does not exist facilitate creating the default group and facilitate adding the one or more recipients to the default group. The instructions when executed may further cause the processor to facilitate receiving from a replying recipient a reply related to the electronic message and an indication to provide the reply to the social network and provide at least a portion of the reply for display as a reply to the message post.

In a further aspect a machine readable medium may include instructions thereon which when executed by a machine or computing device cause the machine or computing device to perform a method for converting electronic messages to message posts. In this regard the method may include facilitating receiving an electronic message designated for one or more recipients in a first system facilitating making a determination that the one or more recipients are members of a social network associated with a sender of the electronic message and in response to making the determination facilitating providing at least a portion of the electronic message for display in a second system associated with the social network as a message post to a message stream associated with the one or more recipients.

The previously described aspects and other aspects may provide one or more advantages including but not limited to using a user s electronic message account to facilitate the population of the user s social network member s message stream even if the user has been slow to adopt using the social network or has accumulated minimal contacts within the social network with other users so that the member is encouraged to interact with the social network.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

System may automatically convert an electronic message for example an email or text message sent via electronic message service to a message post for example a forum comment discussion post blog entry or the like viewable in a message stream for example discussion thread online blog or the like by authorized users of social network . In one example when an electronic message is received at electronic message service of a recipient the electronic message is automatically provided to the recipient s message stream . In another example when an electronic message is composed for sending through electronic message service electronic message client prompts the sender to confirm whether he or she would like electronic message to be posted as a message post to the recipient s message stream in addition to sending it to the designated recipient s . On confirming that electronic message should be posted electronic message including recipient addresses and or attachments may be received by social network . An electronic message processing component may process electronic message headers included with electronic message and determine whether recipient addresses are associated with members of social network . If a recipient address matches a member of social network then the content body of electronic message and any attachments may be posted to the recipient s message stream for private viewing by the recipient.

An electronic message composed at electronic message client and designated for one or more recipients associated with recipient addresses may be sent to the designated recipients though electronic message channels for example using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP . In addition to sending the electronic message message body and subject line may be received for example by a system server for example server of associated with the previously described electronic message service and or social network . Recipient addresses may be included in a message header of the electronic message and the server may process the message header using for example processing component to identify recipient addresses that are associated with one or more corresponding members of social network .

In response to determining that one or more recipients at recipient addresses are members of social network at least a portion of the electronic message for example all or one or more user selected paragraphs of message body may be provided to the social network as a message post for display to the one or more members for example in a message stream in the social network. For example if a recipient address matches an address of a social network member the message post may be provided to a message stream viewable at a profile page associated with member . In this regard the message post will comprise at least a portion of message body as content of the message post and the message post may be highlighted by a heading comprising at least a portion of subject line . In one aspect the message will not be viewable by members of the social network who were not designated as a recipient of the electronic message.

If the electronic message includes an attachment for example an image document or audio or video file or a link for example a hyperlink to a remote resource for example a webpage or file stored at a remote location the attachment or link may also be provided as part of the message post. For example if the electronic message includes a link to a video or image stored in a remote storage location for example storage then the message post may include in connection with content the link. Content of the message post may be automatically formatted to display the link as it is displayed by message body .

In some aspects one or more preview image icons may be generated for one or more links within message body that link to one or more respective videos or images. The preview icons may scale according to how many attachments are included. For example if there is only one video or image then the corresponding preview icon may be larger than if there are two or more videos or images. If there are multiple videos or images then a series of preview icons may be displayed together for example as a photo album . If the electronic message includes a file for example a document image video or audio file or the like attached or embedded within message body then the system server may copy the file to the remote storage location and then include a link to the recently stored file in the message post. The link may be embedded for example as HTML within the electronic message such that the file attached to the electronic message may be displayed together with the display of content .

If the electronic message includes an address embedded within message body the system server may automatically detect the address using for example regular expression matching. The address may then be included within content of the message post as a link to an electronic map for display of the address or location corresponding to the address on the electronic map. In one example the electronic map may be displayed as part of content and include a visual reference for example a visual marker displayed within the electronic map at a geographic location corresponding to the address.

In one aspect the message post may be provided for display only to those recipients who are members of social network . In another aspect the message post may be provided for display only to authorized members of one or more predefined social groups within social network . In one example if a recipient matches a member and member is in a predefined social group related to the sender for example previously created by the sender and the sender has authorized the group to view the message post then the message post may be provided only to the members of social group and not shown to other members outside the social group. Predefined social group may be related to the sender in that the sender is in the same social graph with members of social group . Additionally or in the alternative social group may have been previously defined by the sender to include specific members of the social network for example friends family coworkers acquaintances and the like or that share similar interests. If one or more recipients of the electronic message are not in a predefined social group then electronic message client may prompt the sender to add those recipients to a predefined social group. The sender may be provided with a list of predefined social groups for selection. On selection of a social group the recipients may be added to the social group and the message posted to for example a message stream viewable by the members of the social group.

If the recipient is not in a predefined social group the recipient may automatically be associated with a predefined social group or a default social group. The subject technology may associate a recipient not in a predefined social group with a default social group if the sender has sent more than a predetermined number of electronic messages for example more than three to the recipient over a predetermined period for example the last six months . In another aspect one or more recipients identified from recipient addresses may not be in a predefined social group but other recipients are. On determining that the other recipients are in a predefined social group the one or more recipients may also be associated with the predefined social group. In a further aspect if the one or more recipients identified from recipient addresses are members of social network but have not communicatively connected with the sender within social network for example have not communicated or been added to any social group associated with the sender then a message may be sent to those recipients requesting them to connect with the sender.

With brief reference to the recipient s electronic message service and or electronic message client may be operably connected with social network including for example social network in the previously described manner. In this regard the recipient may choose to convert an incoming message to a message post in the recipient s message stream or to a stream associated with a social group . For example the recipient may pre configure social network to automatically convert incoming messages or may select an option at a control to convert a message when the message is received at electronic message service . Additionally or in the alternative a recipient may on composing a reply electronic message be prompted by the electronic message service or electronic message client to provide at least a portion of the composed reply message as a reply to the message post within social network . In this regard system receives an indication from the replying recipient to provide the reply electronic message to social network and then provides content from the reply electronic message for display as a reply post to the original message post. In some aspects the original post and reply will only be viewable by authorized users for example the sender and recipient.

If the original recipient of electronic message is a member of social network and the original recipient forwards the electronic message to a second recipient system may post the forwarded message to a message stream associated with the second recipient and or associate the second recipient with the social network or social group in the same manner as previously described with respect to the original recipient. Furthermore if electronic message was posted to the second recipient s message stream a representation that the original recipient shared the posted message with the second recipient may be displayed to other users within the same social group in connection with the display of the posted message. Additionally or in the alternative if electronic message was posted to the second recipient s message stream a representation that the original recipient endorsed the posted message may be displayed to those users who could view the message for example users within the same social group . Additional content links or attachments amended to or included with the forwarded message may also be displayed in a message stream of the second recipient in the same manner as if displayed as part of the original message post described previously.

At the social network may be queried to determine if recipients corresponding to the electronic addresses included in the address header are members of the social network. If an electronic address of an electronic message recipient matches a for example verified electronic address of a member of the social network then at a server for example server of may determine whether the recipient is in a social graph with the sender for example associated with one or more predefined social groups related to the sender. On determining that the recipient is in the social graph or a related social group at a message body of the electronic message may be posted to the recipient s message stream as a message post. The message post may be viewable only to the recipient designated in the electronic message or in some aspects may be viewable only to members of the predefined social group but not other members. In other aspects at the time the electronic message is composed or sent the sender may be provided with one or more controls for selecting predefined social groups for whose members may view the message.

On determining that the recipient is not in a social graph with the sender or a predefined social group the server may attempt to automatically associate the recipient with a group. In one example the server may determine whether to add the recipient to a predefined social group based on other recipient addresses included in the electronic message. In this regard at the server may look to determine whether other designated recipients identified by the message header are in a predefined social group. In one aspect if other recipient addresses are found to be in a predefined social group then the recipient may be placed in that group. In another aspect if the other recipient addresses are in the predefined social group and the recipient has been included in electronic messages along with those recipients on other occasions the recipient may be added to the predefined social group. At the server may first determine if the sender had previously sent more than a predetermined number of electronic messages for example more than three to the recipient over a predetermined amount of time for example the past six months before placing the recipient in the group. At the recipient is placed into the predefined social group and at previously described the message body of the electronic message posted to the recipient s message stream.

If a predefined social group may not automatically be found the server may place the recipient in a default social group. For example at the server may determine if the sender had previously sent more than a predetermined number of electronic messages to the recipient over the predetermined amount of time before placing the recipient to the default social group at . Optionally at the system may create the default social group if it does not exist. In some aspects the server may prompt the sender to create and or name the default social group for example if the sender has selected to not place the recipient in an predefined social group . Once the recipient is placed into the default social group at previously described the message body of the electronic message may be posted to the recipient s message stream.

If the recipient address does not match a user of the social network then in addition to sending the electronic message to the recipient address at an invitation message may be sent to the recipient address inviting the recipient associated with the recipient address to join the social network. In other aspects a recipient replying to an electronic message may be prompted by the recipient s electronic message client to post the reply to the message post generated by the original electronic message.

In some aspects first user interface may also include a display of an electronic message client interface for composing electronic messages to one or more recipients including a second user . Electronic message client interface may include one or more controls for converting an electronic message composed at electronic message client interface to a message post viewable by second user in accordance with the previously described manner. Server may facilitate receiving an electronic message composed at electronic message client interface and designated for second user . Server may facilitate making a determination that second user is a member of an online social network associated with a sender of the electronic message. In response to making the determination server may facilitate providing at least a portion of a message body of the electronic message for display as a message post to second user in the social network. For example a second computing device may display a second user interface to second user . Second user interface may include a message receiving interface including a message stream for receiving and viewing messages posted to the social network for example stored in storage . The message body of the electronic message sent by first user may be displayed in message stream designated for example by a header representative of a portion of a subject line originally identifying the subject of the original electronic message.
