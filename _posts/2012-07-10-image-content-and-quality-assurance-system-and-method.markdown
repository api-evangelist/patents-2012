This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 450 807 filed on Apr. 19 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Disclosed herein are computer implement systems and methods for identifying and analyzing content e.g. text images videos etc. published on digital content platforms e.g. webpages mobile applications etc. . Such analysis is then used to determine whether the published content is appropriate for association with or hosting of a third party s content. In one embodiment for example the systems and methods presented are particularly useful for determining the appropriateness of an image published on a digital content platform prior to providing an advertisement proximate the image. As such merchants can avoid associating their advertised products services with vulgar obscene or otherwise inappropriate images that may have a negative impact on their brand or reputation.

Prior to describing the present invention in detail it is useful to provide definitions for key terms and concepts used herein. Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

 Advertisement or ad One or more images with or without associated text to promote or display a product or service. Terms advertisement and ad in the singular or plural are used interchangeably.

 Ad Creative or Creative Computer file with advertisement image or any other content or material related to a product or service. As used herein the phrase providing an advertisement may include providing an ad creative where logically appropriate. Further as used herein the phrase providing a contextually relevant advertisement may include providing an ad creative where logically appropriate.

Ad server One or more computers or equivalent systems which maintains a catalog of creatives delivers creative s and or tracks advertisement s campaigns and or campaign metrics independent of the platform where the advertisement is being displayed.

 Contextual information or contextual tag Data related to the contents and or context of digital content e.g. an image or content within the image for example but not limited to a description identification index or name of an image or object or scene or person or abstraction within the digital content e.g. image .

Contextually relevant advertisement A targeted advertisement that is considered relevant to the contents and or context of digital content on a digital content platform.

Crowdsource network One or more individuals whether human or computer used for a crowdsourcing application.

Crowdsourcing The process of delegating a task to one or more individuals with or without compensation.

Digital content Broadly interpreted to include without exclusion any content available on a digital content platform such as images videos text audio and any combinations and equivalents thereof.

Digital content platform Broadly interpreted to include without exclusion any webpage website browser based web application software application mobile device application e.g. phone or tablet application TV widget and equivalents thereof.

Image A visual representation of an object or scene or person or abstraction in the form of a machine readable and or machine storable work product e.g. one or more computer files storing a digital image a browser readable or displayable image file etc. . As used herein the term image is merely one example of digital content. Further as used herein the term image may refer to the actual visual representation the machine readable and or machine storable work product location identifier s of the machine readable and or machine storable work product e.g. a uniform resource locator URL or any equivalent means to direct a computer implemented system and or user to the visual representation. As such process steps performed on an image may call for different interpretations where logically appropriate. For example the process step of analyzing the context of an image would logically include analyzing the context of a visual representation. However the process step of storing an image on a server would logically include storing a machine readable and or machine storable work product or location identifier s of the machine readable and or machine storable work product e.g. uniform resource locator URL on a server. Further process steps performed on an image may include process steps performed on a copy thumbnail or data file of the image.

Merchant Seller or provider of a product or service agent representing a seller or provider or any third party charged with preparing and or providing digital content associated with a product or service. For example the term merchant should be construed broadly enough to include advertisers an ad agency or other intermediaries charged with developing a digital content to advertise a product or service.

Proximate Is intended to broadly mean relatively adjacent close or near as would be understood by one of skill in the art. The term proximate should not be narrowly construed to require an absolute position or abutment. For example content displayed proximate to an image means content displayed relatively near an image but not necessarily abutting or within the image. To clarify content displayed proximate to an image also includes content displayed abutting or within the image. In another example content displayed proximate to an image means content displayed on the same screen page or webpage as the image. 

Publisher Party that owns provides and or controls digital content or a digital content platform or third party who provides maintains and or controlls digital content and or ad space on a digital content platform.

Except for any term definitions that conflict with the term definitions provided herein the following related co owned and co pending applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12 902 066 13 005 217 13 005 226 13 045 426 13 151 110 13 219 460 13 252 053 13 299 280 13 308 401 13 299 280 and 13 427 341.

Disclosed herein are computer implement systems and methods for identifying and analyzing content e.g. text images videos etc. published on digital content platforms e.g. webpages mobile applications etc. . Such analysis is then used to determine whether the published content is appropriate for association with or hosting of a third party s content.

In one embodiment for example the computer implement systems and methods disclosed herein are used for identifying and analyzing the context content within images published on digital content platforms. The context content of an image is then used to determine whether the image is appropriate for association with or hosting of of a third party s content. The systems and methods presented are particularly useful for third parties e.g. merchants and or content developers to analyze the appropriateness of published images and thereby avoid associating their content e.g. products advertisements in image applications etc. on the digital content platform with vulgar obscene or otherwise inappropriate images. However if an image is deemed appropriate for association with the third party s content then a third party s content is matched linked to the image and provided to the digital content platform for publication proximate to the image. As such third parties can be assured that their content is being associated with or hosted by quality images that will not have a negative impact on their brand or reputation. The systems and methods disclosed herein can also be used to track and score publishers and thereby identify publishers best suited to host third party content.

For example in one embodiment there is provided a computer implemented system and method for a service provider to identify images eligible for hosting advertisements on a digital content platform. The embodiment includes using a computer implemented image collection system to 1 identify an image published on a digital content platform and 2 identify a publisher of the image. The embodiment further includes using a computer implemented image analysis system to assess the context content within the image. If the image analysis system determines that the image is eligible or otherwise appropriate for hosting advertisements then the image is automatically submitted to an image advertisement matching engine wherein the image is linked to an advertisement. The advertisement is then sent to the digital content platform for publication proximate to the image. However if the image analysis system determines that the image is ineligible or otherwise inappropriate for hosting advertisements then the image is flagged as ineligible and is automatically submitted for relationship test analysis. A relationship test analysis is then performed to assess whether the image and or publisher is in violation a pre defined service provider terms of service. A publisher trust score is maintained and updated based on the image analysis and or the relationship test analysis.

Additional embodiments and sub protocols are described in more detail below. However prior to describing such additional embodiments are presented to illustrate three example use cases for the systems and methods presented. As will be clear upon review of merchants and or content providers will benefit from a scalable and automated system to ensure the quality and or appropriateness of published images before they associate their content with the published image via implementation of the various use cases. and the additional embodiments presented outline examples of scalable and automated mechanisms for filtering out inappropriate images and or otherwise ensuring the quality and or appropriateness of published images prior to using the published images to host additional content.

For example is a high level diagram illustrating an example use case for an embodiment of the present invention. Similar systems and methods are discussed in greater detail in the above referenced related applications for example U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 252 053 and 13 299 280. As shown in an image is originally published on a publisher s webpage . When an end user accesses the webpage and activates a hotspot a call is made upon a service provider to provide contextually relevant content e.g. one or more ad creatives and within an image frame provided proximate to the image . The end user can then use interfaces and to browse amongst ad creatives or any digital content otherwise provided and . In practice the service provider implements any of a variety of image content matching algorithms and systems to identify and provide contextually relevant ad creatives and or . Such image content matching algorithms and systems are described in more detail below as well as in the above referenced related applications.

In one embodiment the ad creatives and or are contextually related to each other to the image and or to the rest of the digital content on the webpage . The image frame may be used as a means for the end user to browse ad creatives on the webpage without having to leave the webpage . Further each ad creative within the image frame may provide a link to another webpage such as a merchant s webpage. As such the image frame may provide a means for a merchant to display advertisements that are contextually relevant to the image digital content on the webpage and or other images displayed within the image frame . However if the image or any of the other digital content on the webpage is vulgar obscene or otherwise inappropriate for association with the merchant s ads the systems and methods presented herein can be used to flag the image and or publisher and avoid association or publication of the merchant s ads with the image .

In operation a publisher prepares publishes and maintains an HTML webpage script on a server Arrow A . The publisher also inserts a reference script which serves as a redirect to a dedicated content server maintained by a service provider Arrow B . An end user employs an end user device e.g. computer mobile device tablet etc. and web browser or alternatively a mobile application i.e. app to access the HTML webpage script via the Internet Arrow C . The user s web browser loads the HTML webpage script as a viewable webpage within the web browser . The webpage may include content such as image s and text . The image may include one or more hotspots or other means of activating the image. In one embodiment the image is not originally published with a hotspot but instead has a hotspot activated after the service provider has identified and analyzed the image and or the end user mouses over the image.

Arrow E indicates the reference script calling to the service provider and more specifically to a content decision engine maintained by the service provider in order for the service provider to identify the image and identify content that is contextually relevant to the image. Such contextually relevant content e.g. contextually relevant advertisements is then returned to the end user device for display within the web browser as shown by Arrow F. In one embodiment the contextually relevant content is shown within the same pixel frame or pixel profile as the originally published image . However the contextually relevant content can be published anywhere proximate to image .

As with use case if the image or any of the other content on the webpage is vulgar obscene or otherwise inappropriate for association with the available contextually relevant content the systems and methods presented herein can be used to flag the image and or the publisher and avoid association or publication of contextually relevant content with the image webpage and or publisher .

As shown in one or more application developer s may provide one or more interactive applications for enablement activation and rendering on published digital content e.g. the image . In practice applications and or can be enabled by the application developer a service provider and or the publisher of the digital content. Enablement of the applications provides the end user with a palette of applications to choose from. In the example shown in the end user can then activate one or more of the enabled applications by selecting a respective icon or hotspot on the image . User activation of the selected application then pulls image data available for the image in order to render an in image interactive application proximate to the image. The use of the term in image should not be interpreted to require a fixed positional relationship between the image and the application. For example in one embodiment an in image application may be rendered proximate to the image i.e. inside or outside the image boundary frame near the image on the same screen as the image on the same webpage as the image or any other equivalent position relative to the image. 

In order for the enablement activation and or rendering of the in image application to be relevant to the image the application developer s may require detailed contextual information or data on the contents context of the image . In practice the contextual data is provided by the service provider . More specifically the service provider implements various interfaces and sub protocols to identify published content analyze the content index and maintain the data available on the content and provide contextual data to the enabled and activated applications and . For example the service provider can pull digital images published on webpages and process the images through an image tagging engine . Within the image tagging engine the service provider employs techniques such as algorithmic identification or analysis of the image image recognition protocols and analysis of the image proximate text recognition in search of contextual information of the image based on text published proximate to the image submission of the image to a crowdsource network to identify the context of the image and tag the image with relevant data a thematic tagging engine to identify and tag the image with relevant data based on a pre defined theme an application feedback engine to receive use feedback from an enabled activated and rendered application and or any combinations or equivalents thereof. Information data obtained or developed respective to the image is then stored in an image data repository . In one embodiment the image data is indexed within image data repository via a unique image key uniform resource locator URL or equivalents thereof. As such inquiries and or searches upon image data repository may quickly and effectively provide all relevant data available for use in an interactive in image application.

As with use cases and if the image is vulgar obscene or otherwise inappropriate for association with the applications or the systems and methods presented herein can be used to flag the image and or the publisher of the image and avoid association or enablement activation publication of the applications or with the image .

More specifically shows an embodiment wherein a service provider analyzes an image published on a digital content platform . In practice the image is received and stored within an image database . Of note an actual copy of the image need not be stored into the image database . For example the image database can be used to capture and store metadata around the image a URL link of the image post processing metadata associated with the image a thumbnail of the image an image hash of the image or any equivalent means for identifying viewing or processing of the image. Publisher data is also received from the digital content platform and stored in a publisher database .

Image collection or capture procedures include scraping images from the digital content platform a web crawling robot computer code for walking the DOM tree a computerized widget to automatically queue images when the webpages are first loaded an interface for a publisher to submit published images and or any combinations or equivalents thereof. The collecting or capturing of images broadly includes the identifying of making a copy of and or saving a copy of the image or associated data into image database . The collecting or capturing of images may also broadly include identifying image locations e.g. image URLs such that the images need not be stored temporarily or permanently in image database but may still be accessed when needed.

Within image database the images or image identifiers may be cataloged categorized sub categorized and or scored based on image metadata and or existing image tags. In one embodiment the scoring may be based on data obtained from the digital content platform that published the image . The data may be selected from the group consisting of image hash digital publisher identification publisher priority image category image metadata quality of digital image size of digital image date of publication of the digital image time of publication of digital image image traffic statistics and any combination or equivalents thereof. The images may also be tagged with the location of origin of the image. The image may also be thumb nailed resized or otherwise modified to optimize processing.

In one embodiment image database is maintained by the service provider . Alternatively the service provider need not maintain but only have access to the image database . The images within image database e.g. the image are then processed by the service provider through a quality assurance filter and an image content matching engine .

In the embodiment shown the quality assurance filter includes one or more sub protocols such as hash based filter content based filter and or relationship based filter . Within hash based filter an image hash analysis is performed to test whether the image hash matches any known or previously flagged inappropriate image hashes. For example an image hash analysis can be used to automatically and quickly identify image hashes for known pornography images. Such image hash identification provides an automated and scalable means for removing inappropriate images from further analysis and processing. Image hashing algorithms are described in greater detail in Venkatesan et al. Robust Image Hashing IEEE Intn l Conf. on Image Processing ICIP September 2000 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

A content based filter can then be applied to images that pass the hash based filter . Within the content based filter image recognition algorithms and or crowdsourcing protocols can be applied to review and analyze the context content of the processed images. The content based filter may further include image pattern matching algorithms to automatically scan and detect image content based on metrics such as patter. As such a pattern scan of the image can be performed to compare the pattern scan of the image against a database of known ineligible images. If the pattern scan of the image matches a pattern scan of a known ineligible image then the image can be flagged as ineligible for hosting content. If the pattern scan of the image does not match a pattern scan of a known ineligible image then the image can be submitted for further processing. The content based filter may further include text association analysis algorithms to detect metadata text and or scrape the published page for associated text clues or hints of the image. As such a comparison of the text association analysis of the image may be performed against a database of known ineligible images. If the text association analysis of the image matches a known ineligible image then the image can be flagged as ineligible for hosting content. If the text association analysis of the image does not match a known ineligible image then the image can be submitted for further processing. In other words a content based filter serves as a means for checking and or verifying the context content of the image.

A relationship based filter may then be applied to images that pass both the hash based filter and or the content based filter . Within the relationship based filter publisher information and or other external data can be used to determine whether the image is appropriate for hosting content. For example there may be instances wherein the image itself is appropriate for hosting contextually relevant advertisements but the publisher and or platform may be deemed inappropriate. Such instances may include pornography dedicated websites and or publishers with negative trust scores ratings or controversial reputations. Merchants for example may not wish to associate their advertisements with such publishers even if a particularly published image is otherwise appropriate.

Images that pass the quality assurance filter are then submitted to an image content matching engine wherein the images may be subjected to one or more sub protocols such as algorithmic content matching image recognition analysis of the image proximate text recognition in search of contextual information of the image based on text published proximate to the image submission of the image to a crowdsource network to identify the context content of the image and tag the image with relevant data tags a thematic tagging engine to identify and tag the image with relevant data tags based on a pre defined theme publisher provided data analysis and or any combinations or equivalents thereof. Content e.g. ads apps etc. stored in a content database can then be matched to appropriate images and sent to the digital content platform for publication proximate to the image . For example if quality assurance filter deems the image to be appropriate for hosting content then when an end user activates hotspot the service provider can provide contextually relevant content and in a scrollable image frame on the digital content platform .

However images that pass the image hash analysis of step are further subjected to an image content analysis in step . Image content analysis may include various sub protocols as presented herein including image recognition analysis and submission of the image to a crowdsource network for content analysis. If the image content analysis of step determines that the image is appropriate for hosting ads content the image is forwarded to an image content matching engine in step . Sources providing appropriate images for hosting ads content then have their trust score updated in step .

If the image content analysis of step determines that the image is inappropriate for hosting ads content the process continues with step as discussed above and or step . In step a relationship test analysis is performed to determine whether the image content and or the source violates pre defined terms of service. The terms of service may include pre defined agreements between the service provider and the various sources. If the terms of service have been violated the process continues with step . However if the terms of service have not been violated the process may have a secondary check performed at step . For example in step a determination is made as to whether to reverse the decision or flagging of step . If not the process may continue with step . However if the decision or flagging of step is reversed the image can be sent to the image content matching engine of step and the source s trust score can be updated in step .

In another embodiment there is provided computer implement systems and methods for selecting images eligible for hosting ads on a digital content platform filtering images for inappropriate content monitoring image content quality policing publishers of digital content platforms and or ensuring image quality in an image analysis system. The embodiment includes pulling receiving or inputting a plurality of images image identifiers image location identifiers and or image URLs from a plurality of digital content platforms e.g. webpages social networks mobile software applications etc. . The embodiment includes filtering or processing the plurality of images through a first algorithmic filter to identify any ineligible images. The first algorithmic filter may include machine learning of publisher tendencies a crawler function that adjusts depending on learning of publisher tendencies a crawler function that identifies the image as inappropriate by matching the image to a pre identified ineligible image and or an image hash function analysis. Ineligible images are the removed from further consideration. The publisher of the ineligible image may also be flagged for publisher review. The embodiment also includes storing the eligible images into a database and processing the images through a first content filter. The first content filter may be a certified crowdsource network member. Images deemed ineligible based on content are then flagged for processing through a second content filter. However images deemed eligible based on content are submitted to an image content or image ad matching engine. The image content or image ad matching engine may include a crowdsourcing network for matching content advertisements to images based on the context content of the image. The embodiment further includes processing the flagged images through a second content filter wherein images are analyzed to identify whether they violate pre defined publisher terms of service. The second content filter can also 1 analyze publisher metrics 2 update a publisher s score rating 3 update a publisher s trust ranking and or 4 flag the publisher for publisher review. If the second content filter identifies an image that violates pre defined publisher terms of service the publisher can be entirely removed from the system and their images may be removed from the image database. As such removed publishers images do not get processed by the system. The embodiment may further include performing a publisher review to identify publishers that should be re enabled after being disabled removed from the system.

In another embodiment there is provided a method for identifying a digital content publisher to exclude from a computer implemented image advertisement matching system wherein the image advertisement matching system includes 1 an image input cue for receiving a plurality of images from a plurality of digital content platforms 2 one or more content filters for identifying images that are ineligible for hosting advertisements and or 3 a crowdsource network for matching at least one digital advertisement to a respective image. In practice the digital advertisement is then provided proximate to the image on the digital content platform maintained by the digital content publisher. The method includes one or more of the steps of a storing the images received in the image input cue in an image database b processing images from the database through a first algorithmic filter to identify one or more ineligible images c identifying the publisher of an ineligible image based on an algorithmic filter and flagging the publisher for publisher review d processing the images from the database through a first content filter e identifying the publisher of an ineligible image based on content and flagging the publisher for publisher review f processing flagged images through a second content filter wherein images are analyzed to identify whether they violate pre defined publisher terms of service wherein if the second content filter identifies an image that violates pre defined publisher terms of service the publisher is excluded from the image advertisement matching system and their images are removed from the database and or g performing a publisher review to identify publishers that should be re enabled after being excluded in step f . The first algorithmic filter may include machine learning of publisher tendencies a crawler function that adjusts depending on learning of publisher tendencies a crawler function that identifies the image as inappropriate by matching the image to a pre identified ineligible image and or an image hash algorithmic analysis. The first content filter may include crowdsource network for flagging ineligible images for further review based on content. The second content filter may also 1 analyze publisher metrics 2 update a publisher s score rating 3 update a publisher s trust ranking and or 4 flag the publisher for publisher review.
