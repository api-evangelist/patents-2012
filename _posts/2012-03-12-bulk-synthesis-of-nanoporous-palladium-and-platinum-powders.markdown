This present invention pertains to a method for the manufacture of nanoporous palladium and platinum powders. More particularly this invention pertains to the synthesis of palladium and platinum powders having particle diameters of approximately 50 nm wherein each particle is perforated by a plurality of approximately 3 nm pores. Such materials are of potential value for hydrogen isotope storage and electrical charge storage applications.

Palladium and platinum are of well known value for applications in catalysis hydrogen storage and electrochemistry Lewis F. A. 1996 v.21 6 pp. 461 464 . Interfacial interactions can often limit performance so a high surface area material is usually desired. In these cases as a practical maximum every point in the material particle would be ideally within a few atoms of an interface. Such materials would exhibit high double layer capacitance higher reaction rates in kinetically limited interfacial reactions and in the case of palladium rapid charging with hydrogen. When the hydrogen isotope is tritium the helium decay product is more likely to diffuse out of the particle limiting the formation of bubbles that can compromise mechanical properties.

These previous approaches have brought disadvantages in scalability safety purity versatility and or pore density.

We present a convenient pathway that is satisfactory in all of these criteria resulting in Pd and Pt nanopowders with 2 nm 3 nm pores that we have produced in gram scale batches.

It is therefore an object of this invention to provide palladium and platinum powders having an average particle size of about 80 nm or less wherein each particle comprises a plurality of nanopores approximately 2 nm 3 nm in diameter.

It is also an object of this invention to provide a method for preparing nanoporous palladium and platinum powders using a reducing agent which does not introduce metal boride impurities.

It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method for slowing the reaction for reducing palladium and platinum so that the reaction does not occur on the timescale of constituent mixing and so that microscopic conditions are as uniform as possible.

Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed. The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification illustrate several embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention.

We describe herein a method to provide nanoporous palladium and platinum which avoids the shortcomings of the prior art.

Materials Palladium black ammonium tetrachloropalladate ammonium tetrachloroplatinate and palladium II chloride were purchased from Alfa Alfa. Aesar Ward Hill Mass. . BRIJ 56 a polyethylene glycol hexadecyl ether surfactant e.g. CH OCHCH OH where n is about 10 sodium chloride ammonium chloride ascorbic acid hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide were all purchased from Aldrich Sigma Aldrich Co. St. Louis Mo. . All materials were used as received and 18 M deionized water was prepared in the laboratory.

Metal salt pastes 17.7 mg of palladium II chloride 0.1 millimole and 47.0 mg of sodium chloride 0.8 millimole were added to 0.4 mL of deionized water and heated to 80 C. in a water bath. All solids dissolved forming a brown solution. Alternatively 28.4 mg of ammonium tetrachloropalladate was dissolved in the same volume of water with no added sodium chloride and heated to 80 C. For platinum 37.3 mg ammonium tetrachloroplatinate was dissolved in 0.3 mL water and 0.1 mL 4M hydrochloric acid and heated to 80 C. In addition other alkali metal ammonium chlorides or bromides and their complexes with palladium or platinum can be used. In each case 0.66 mL of BRIJ 56 previously melted in the water bath was added to the solution and mixed by shaking or preferably with a vortex mixer until the paste becomes too viscous to agitate easily. Heating and mixing cycles typically 3 were continued until a homogenous brown paste is formed. The paste was left on the bench to cool to room temperature and then placed in a 20 C. freezer.

Reducing paste 14.4 L concentrated ammonium hydroxide about 30 0.214 millimole and 41.9 mg ascorbic acid 0.238 millimole or a similar formulation of buffered ascorbate were dissolved in 0.186 mL water and heated to 80 C. 0.33 mL BRIJ 56 was added and the mixture homogenized and cooled as above resulting in a white paste.

Porous metal particles Pastes cooled to 20 C. were kneaded together with ceramic spatulas for several minutes in a casserole dish that also had been cooled to 20 C. No color change in the pastes was seen at this point. Equal amounts of the kneaded paste were loaded into two 50 mL centrifuge tubes and returned to the freezer. One day later the tubes were moved to a 4 C. refrigerator and left for 2 days. The pastes were stirred and then left for 1 day at room temperature and gradually turned black over these 4 days. In the case of platinum no cooling below room temperature was necessary and the preferred reaction time was 2 weeks.

To remove the surfactant and byproducts the tubes were filled with ethanol and heated to 80 C. with intermittent vortexing and sonication. This dissolved the paste leaving a black suspension. Solids were separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm and the faintly yellow supernatant was decanted. The black material was resuspended in 50 mL water heated to 80 C. for 10 minutes and centrifuged again. The material easily resuspends in water so it was decanted carefully leaving approximately 1 mL. This step was repeated one more time with ethanol. Higher yields can be obtained using preferably two rinses of a solution comprising 3 parts by volume ethanol to 1 part by volume water. The procedure has been tested on scales ranging from 0.1 millimole to 5.5 millimoles. We have been able to purify up to 1 millimole per centrifuge tube.

In this approach metal salts in the aqueous phase are reduced to metal particles that grow around hexagonally packed surfactant cylinders. When the surfactant is washed away a pore remains. Careful choice of reducing agent and conditions allows extended growth of particles without disturbing the surfactant structure and minimizes incorporation of impurities.

At room temperature mixing the palladium and ascorbate pastes results in immediate reaction the mixture turns gray or black in patches. It is preferable to slow the reaction so that it does not occur on the timescale of mixing and that microscopic conditions are as uniform as possible. Adding 8 equivalents of sodium or ammonium chloride to the palladium paste or 6 to the palladium paste and 3 to the ascorbate paste slows the reaction rate sufficiently. This can also be achieved by reducing the temperature. The results reported here use both approaches although it is preferable to use primarily the latter because it results in less material that must be removed during the isolation steps.

The reaction is exothermic so care must be taken during mixing to keep the temperature low. For scales much larger than 1 gram the use of chloride to slow the reaction may be preferable but we obtained satisfactory results by kneading on a cold nonporous surface. Platinum must be kept acidic to suppress reaction with oligo ethylene oxide at the elevated temperatures needed to prepare the paste. Under these conditions reduction by ascorbic acid is slow so added salt and reduced temperature are less important. The palladium reaction also can be performed under acidic conditions without cooling below room temperature but it proceeds more quickly at higher pH. Keeping the pH near the pKof ascorbate helps ensure that the reaction rates at the start and end of the reaction are comparable allowing high yield to be achieved in a relatively short time.

Cleaning the product is challenging given the high surface area pore aspect ratio and reactivity of a bare palladium surface. Ethanol efficiently removes nearly all of the surfactant but washing with water or an ethanol water mixture is required to remove salts as illustrated in the Auger spectra shown in . When washes are performed at room temperature thermogravimetric analysis shows mass losses in the 1 range under air at 180 C. 200 C. suggesting the presence of organic contaminants. This number is several times smaller if the washing steps are heated as shown in . As a point of reference if pores are assumed to be spaced by one diameter one would expect about 20 of the material s volume to be pores and palladium is 10 times denser than typical organic material so clogged pores would be expected to show a 2 mass loss in the air analysis.

BET surface area measurements shown in were performed with an ASAP 2020 Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry Analyzer obtained from Micromeritics Instrument Corporation Norcross Ga. using nitrogen as the analytic gas at 77 K. Prior to analysis samples were de gassed under vacuum for several hours at 50 C. shows the pore size distributions of a quantity of palladium powder made by the present method wherein the sharp peak below 2 nm corresponds to the porosity incorporated in the palladium particles. The broader distribution of pore size reflects the spacing between particles. shows an expanded view of the same pore distribution up to 20 nm and more clearly shows the 2 nm peak. The presence of this peak demonstrates that the pores are accessible to the measuring gas.

Pore geometry can be elucidated using transmission electron microscopy and tomography. shows particles imaged at zero tilt angle showing faceted particles in the 50 nm range that are perforated by 2 3 nm pores arranged with a degree of regularity and density but not close packed.

To demonstrate that the high contrast regions shown in are pores that go through the entire particle scanning transmission electron micrographs were collected at several angles and reconstructed to form a three dimensional representation of several particles. A series of 1 nm slices through this reconstructed view are shown in and show pores that nm the length of the particle with slight irregularities in their path.

Several effects may contribute to the observed pore density differences between the two metals. Electroplated palladium in purified surfactant shows regular pores but the more constrained environment of a film may make regularity easier to maintain than in a free particle. We suspect that the surfactant assembly is perturbed by concentration gradients of reactants and products which are exacerbated by higher reaction rates recall that the platinum reaction proceeds much more slowly. Specific interactions between the particle surface and the products or surfactants may influence the arrangement of surfactant molecules an effect that would be more pronounced in a suspended particle than a film. The difference between our palladium and other results also may depend on the aspect ratio of the product. The tilted platinum particles in suggest a thinner product than the palladium particles as is consistent with other reports. We can expect pore regularity to be more likely over shorter distances. If true this effect may mean that attempts to grow particles larger than about 50 nm will produce less regular pores resulting in a practical upper limit on particle size. By seeding particle growth by mixing a half batch of previously formed particles into the metal paste before adding the reducing paste we were able to produce 80 nm diameter particles with similar pore size and density to the seed particles so we have not yet observed such an upper limit.

The material presented herein is practical to prepare at useful scales and is of potential benefit to hydrogen isotope storage electrical energy storage and catalysis applications due to the high exposed surface area provided by the observed high density of small pores. We anticipate that surfactant templates such as BRIJ 56 may result in the highest practical surface areas for porous noble metals for smaller pores high pore surface energy and mobility may result in pore collapse at low temperatures. Results reported here show that the 2 nm 3 nm pores in palladium and platinum are stable at 80 C.
