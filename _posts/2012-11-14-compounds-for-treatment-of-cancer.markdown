Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States exceeded only by heart disease. In the United States cancer accounts for 1 of every 4 deaths. The 5 year relative survival rate for all cancer patients diagnosed in 1996 2003 is 66 up from 50 in 1975 1977 American Cancer Society Atlanta Ga. 2008 . This improvement in survival reflects progress in diagnosing at an earlier stage and improvements in treatment. Discovering highly effective anticancer agents with low toxicity is a primary goal of cancer research.

Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments consisting of tubulin heterodimers and are involved in a wide range of cellular functions including shape maintenance vesicle transport cell motility and division. Tubulin is the major structural component of the microtubules and a well verified target for a variety of highly successful anti cancer drugs. Compounds that are able to interfere with microtubule tubulin equilibrium in cells are effective in the treatment of cancers. Anticancer drugs like taxol and vinblastine that are able to interfere with microtubule tubulin equilibrium in cells are extensively used in cancer chemotherapy. There are three major classes of antimitotic agents. Microtubule stabilizing agents which bind to fully formed microtubules and prevent the depolymerization of tubulin subunits are represented by taxanes and epothilones. The other two classes of agents are microtubule destabilizing agents which bind to tubulin dimers and inhibit their polymerization into microtubules. Vina alkaloids such as vinblastine bind to the vinca site and represent one of these classes. Colchicine and colchicine site binders interact at a distinct site on tubulin and define the third class of antimitotic agents.

Both the taxanes and vinca alkaloids are widely used to treat human cancers while no colchicine site binders are currently approved for cancer chemotherapy yet. However colchicine binding agents like combretastatin A 4 CA 4 and ABT 751 are now under clinical investigation as potential new chemotherapeutic agents Luo Y. Hradil V. P. Frost D. J. Rosenberg S.

Unfortunately microtubule interacting anticancer drugs in clinical use share two major problems resistance and neurotoxicity. A common mechanism of multidrug resistance MDR namely ATP binding cassette ABC transporter protein mediated drug efflux limits their efficacy Green H. Rosenberg P. Soderkvist P. Horvath G.

P glycoproteins P gp encoded by the MDR1 gene are important members of the ABC superfamily. P gp prevents the intracellular accumulation of many cancer drugs by increasing their efflux out of cancer cells as well as contributing to hepatic renal or intestinal clearance pathways. Attempts to co administer P gp modulators or inhibitors to increase cellular availability by blocking the actions of P gp have met with limited success Gottesman M. M. Pastan I.

The other major problem with taxanes as with many biologically active natural products is its lipophilicity and lack of solubility in aqueous systems. This leads to the use of emulsifiers like Cremophor EL and Tween 80 in clinical preparations. A number of biologic effects related to these drug formulation vehicles have been described including acute hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathies Hennenfent K. L. Govindan R. Novel formulations of taxanes a review. Old wine in a new bottle 2006 17 5 735 49 ten Tije A. J. Verweij J. Loos W. J. Sparreboom A.

Compared to compounds binding the paclitaxel or vinca alkaloid binding site colchicine binding agents usually exhibit relatively simple structures. Thus providing a better opportunity for oral bioavailability via structural optimization to improve solubility and pharmacokinetic PK parameters. In addition many of these drugs appear to circumvent P gp mediated MDR. Therefore these novel colchicine binding site targeted compounds hold great promise as therapeutic agents particularly since they have improved aqueous solubility and overcome P gp mediated MDR.

Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancers among men in the US and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths with over 180 000 new cases and almost 29 000 deaths expected this year. Patients with advanced prostate cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy ADT typically either by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone LHRH agonists or by bilateral orchiectomy. Androgen deprivation therapy not only reduces testosterone but estrogen levels are also lower since estrogen is derived from the aromatization of testosterone which levels are depleted by ADT. Androgen deprivation therapy induced estrogen deficiency causes significant side effects which include hot flushes gynecomastia and mastalgia bone loss decreases in bone quality and strength osteoporosis and life threatening fractures adverse lipid changes and higher cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction and depression and other mood changes.

Leuprolide acetate Lupron is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH or LHRH . Leuprolide acetate is an LHRH superagonist that eventually suppresses LH secretion by the pituitary. Leuprolide acetate acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion resulting in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. In humans administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone LH and follicle stimulating hormone FSH leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females . However continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH. In males testosterone is reduced to castrate levels below 50 ng dL . In premenopausal females estrogens are reduced to postmenopausal levels. Testosterone is a known stimulus for cancerous cells of the prostate. Suppressing testosterone secretion or inhibiting the actions of testosterone is thus a necessary component of prostate cancer therapy. Leuprolide acetate can be used for LH suppression which is the reduction and lowering of serum testosterone to castrate levels to treat prostate cancer.

Malignant melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer accounting for about 75 of skin cancer deaths. The incidence of melanoma is rising steadily in Western populations. The number of cases has doubled in the past 20 years. Around 160 000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed worldwide each year and it is more frequent in males and Caucasians. According to a WHO Report about 48 000 melanoma related deaths occur worldwide per year.

Currently there is no effective way to treat metastatic melanoma. It is highly resistant to current chemotherapy radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis with a median survival rate of 6 months and a 5 year survival rate of less than 5 . In the past 30 years dacarbazine DTIC is the only FDA approved drug for metastatic melanoma. However it provides only less than 5 of complete remission in patients. In recent years great efforts have been attempted in fighting metastatic melanoma. Neither combinations of DTIC with other chemotherapy drugs e.g. cisplatin vinblastine and carmustine nor adding interferon 2b to DTIC have shown a survival advantage over DTIC treatment alone. Most recently clinical trials with antibodies and vaccines to treat metastatic melanoma also failed to demonstrate satisfactory efficacy. Ipilimumab Yervoy is such drug that uses your immune system to fight melanoma. Ipilimumab is used to treat advanced melanoma that has spread beyond its original location. Targeted therapy uses medications designed to target specific vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Vemurafenib Zelboraf is a targeted therapy approved to treat advanced melanoma that can t be treated with surgery or melanoma that has spread through the body. Vemurafenib only treats melanoma that has a certain genetic mutation.

Melanoma cells have low levels of spontaneous apoptosis in vivo compared with other tumor cell types and they are relatively resistant to drug induced apoptosis in vitro. The natural role of melanocytes is to protect inner organs from UV light a potent DNA damaging agent. Therefore it is not surprising that melanoma cells may have special DNA damage repair systems and enhanced survival properties. Moreover recent studies showed that during melanoma progression it acquired complex genetic alterations that led to hyperactivation of efflux pumps detoxification enzymes and a multifactorial alteration of survival and apoptotic pathways. All these have been proposed to mediate the multidrug resistant MDR phenotype of melanoma. With the rapidly rising incidence of this disease and the high resistance to current therapeutic agents developing more effective drugs for advanced melanoma and other cancer types that can effectively circumvent MDR will provide significant benefits to cancer patients.

In one embodiment metastatic cancer refers to a cancer that spread metastasized from its original site to another area of the body. Virtually all cancers have the potential to spread. Whether metastases develop depends on the complex interaction of many tumor cell factors including the type of cancer the degree of maturity differentiation of the tumor cells the location and how long the cancer has been present as well as other incompletely understood factors. Metastases spread in three ways by local extension from the tumor to the surrounding tissues through the bloodstream to distant sites or through the lymphatic system to neighboring or distant lymph nodes. Each kind of cancer may have a typical route of spread. The tumor is called by the primary site ex. breast cancer that has spread to the brain is called metastatic breast cancer to the brain .

In one embodiment drug resistant cancer refers to cancer cells that acquire resistance to chemotherapy. Cancer cells can acquire resistance to chemotherapy by a range of mechanisms including the mutation or overexpression of the drug target inactivation of the drug or elimination of the drug from the cell. Tumors that recur after an initial response to chemotherapy may be resistant to multiple drugs they are multidrug resistant . In the conventional view of drug resistance one or several cells in the tumor population acquire genetic changes that confer drug resistance. Accordingly the reasons for drug resistance inter alia are a some of the cells that are not killed by the chemotherapy mutate change and become resistant to the drug. Once they multiply there may be more resistant cells than cells that are sensitive to the chemotherapy b Gene amplification. A cancer cell may produce hundreds of copies of a particular gene. This gene triggers an overproduction of protein that renders the anticancer drug ineffective c cancer cells may pump the drug out of the cell as fast as it is going in using a molecule called p glycoprotein d cancer cells may stop taking in the drugs because the protein that transports the drug across the cell wall stops working e the cancer cells may learn how to repair the DNA breaks caused by some anti cancer drugs f cancer cells may develop a mechanism that inactivates the drug. One major contributor to multidrug resistance is overexpression of P glycoprotein P gp . This protein is a clinically important transporter protein belonging to the ATP binding cassette family of cell membrane transporters. It can pump substrates including anticancer drugs out of tumor cells through an ATP dependent mechanism. Thus the resistance to anticancer agents used in chemotherapy is the main cause of treatment failure in malignant disorders provoking tumors to become resistant. Drug resistance is the major cause of cancer chemotherapy failure.

In one embodiment resistant cancer refers to drug resistant cancer as described herein above. In another embodiment resistant cancer refers to cancer cells that acquire resistance to any treatment such as chemotherapy radiotherapy or biological therapy.

To determine water solubility 1 mg of each compound was suspended in 1 mL water and shaken for 48 h at room temperature RT . The suspension was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and filtered on 0.22 m filter. Concentrations of each compound were measured by LC MS consisting of an HP S1100 HPLC instrument Agilent Foster ceity CA and a Bruker ESQUIRE MS detector with electrospray ion trap instrument in positive ion mode Bruker Fremont Calif. . For HPLC a reverse phase Nova pak C18 column 150 mm 3.9 mm Waters Milford Mass. was used. The mobile phase was composed of 20 80 v v water acetonitrile. For MASS the peak was extracted at 382 m z for imidazole compounds and 399 m z for thiazole compounds respectively. The concentration of each compound was calculated by MS peak area according to the following calibration equation y 1.3295x 114.24 R 1.00 . To make the standard curve from which the equation was derived 50 100 L of each 100 g mL 10 g mL of ABI compound 12ga and its corresponding thiazole analog as well as CA 4 see for structure in acetonitrile were injected into HPLC and monitored by mass spectroscopy.

Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assay of Prostate Cancer and Melanoma. All cell lines were obtained from ATCC American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA while cell culture supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech Herndon Va. USA . We examined the antiproliferative activity of our anti tubulin compounds in four human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP DU 145 PC 3 and PPC 1 and two human melanoma cell lines A375 and WM 164 . Human ovarian cell line OVCAR 8 and its resistant cell line that over expresses P gp NCI ADR RES were used as MDR models. Both ovarian cell lines were obtained from National Cancer Institutes NCI . All cell lines were tested and authenticated by either ATCC or NCI. All prostate cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS .

Melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5 FBS 1 antibiotic antimycotic mixture Sigma Aldrich Inc. St. Louis Mo. USA and bovine insulin 5 g mL Sigma Aldrich . The cytotoxic potential of the anti tubulin compounds was evaluated using the sulforhodamine B SRB assay after 96 h of treatment.

All of the reported compounds were first evaluated for cytotoxicity in the mouse melanoma cell line B16 F1 human melanoma cell lines A375 and WM 164 and prostate cancer cell lines DU145 PC 3 LNCaP PPC 1 . Compound 1h and ABT 751 E7010 Abbott Laboratories Eisai Co Ltd which has entered phase II clinical studies in treating patients with different cancers were included in the assays as examples of colchicine site binding agents. ICvalues for cell growth inhibition are shown in Tables 1 2 and 3.

The first series was targeted to alternatives to the thiazole B ring. Accordingly a series of heterocyclic B rings were examined. As shown in Table 1 the successful replacements of the thiazole were pyridine 1c furan 1d and thiophene 1f. The ICs 12 nM 35 nM against prostate cancer cells are close to the thiazole compound 1h. Introducing phenyl 1a oxazoline 35a and oxazole 36a maintained activity in the hundreds of nanomolar range. But introducing of pyrimidine 1b IC 3.7 8.3 M a reversed 2 5 thiazole and 3 5 isoxazole 1e and 1i IC 10 M caused obvious losses of potency. Modification of B ring to the saturated ring of piperidine 1g also totally abolished activity IC 20 M .

In vitro hepatic metabolic stability studies revealed that the carbonyl linker between B and C rings in SMART compounds caused short half lives 5 17 min primarily due to carbonyl reduction. For the sake of blocking this ketone reduction to the inactive hydroxyl linker compound 2b the carbonyl linker in the second series of compounds was modified Table 2 . The carbonyl linker was replaced with double bonds 2a 3a and 3b amides 2g 2h oximes 2e cis trans and 2f cis trans hydrazide 2d cis 2d trans acrylonitriles 2c trans 2c cis cyanoimine 2j sulfonyl amide 4d sulfur ether 4a sulfonyl and sulfinyl compounds 4b 4c . A direct link compound 2i without any linker between B and C rings was also prepared. Among these linker modifications only cyanoimine linkage 2j showed promising potential 20 60 nM compared with carbonyl compound 1h but an in vitro metabolism study showed that the half life of 2j in human liver microsome was less than 5 min. This suggested that although the ketone reduction is blocked it might introduce a new metabolic liability in compound 2j. The isomer pairs of compounds containing double bonds oximes and hydrazides were separated. Compound 3a was designed to mimic the structure of CA 4 FIG. which contain a cis C C between two aryl rings unfortunately 3a and other isomer pairs lost activity after replacing the C O linker. One interesting phenomenon is syn isomer of 2e cis 0.1 0.3 M showed 10 fold more activity than its anti isomer 2e trans 10 M . The half life of 2e cis in human liver microsome is extended to 35 min while half lives of compounds 2d can be prolonged to 55 min. But decreased activity 1 M of 2d also reduced their potency.

The solubility of drugs was determined by Multiscreen Solubility Filter Plate Millipore Corporate Billerica Mass. coupled with LC MS MS. Briefly 198 L of phosphate buffered saline PBS buffer pH 7.4 was loaded into 96 well plate and 2 L of 10 mM test compounds in DMSO was dispensed and mixed with gentle shaking 200 300 rpm for 1.5 h at RT N 3 . The plate was centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min and the filtrate was used to determine its concentration and solubility of test compound by LC MS MS as described below.

One major limitation of the SMART agents is low aqueous solubility. Surfactants such as Tween 80 were used to study in vivo SMART behavior accordingly favorable results were obtained. But these surfactants are biologically active and are responsible for many side effects. In addition it was thought that low aqueous solubility of 1h resulted in low oral bioavailability 3.3 Table 4 . In the third series of compounds the aqueous solubility was successfully increased without impacting the potency by introducing polar groups like hydroxyl and indolyls. In addition ionizable groups like amino and alkylamino groups were also introduced into A ring para position. As shown in and Table 3 introducing indolyl groups to the A ring especially 5 indolyl 66a 7 25 nM increased the potency compared with the 4 OH compound 2l 76 116 nM . Aminomethyl CHNHat the A ring para position also maintained potency 2r 13 80 nM but p NHMe 2s or p NMe 2u abrogated activity. As shown in analytical measurement to estimate aqueous solubility showed that indolyl compound 66a increased solubility in PBS from 1.1 g mL compound 1h to 3.8 g mL. Aminomethyl compound 2r was converted to the HCl salt which increased solubility over 35 fold 35 g mL . Although compound 2r showed satisfactory aqueous solubility the pharmacokinetic studies showed this compound still had very poor bioavailability F 0.2 . It was thought that compound 2r was ionized in the stomach and therefore not absorbed into the circulation system.

Female Sprague Dawley rats n 3 or 4 254 4 g were purchased from Harlan Inc. Indianapolis Ind. . Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. Braintree Mass. . On arrival at the animal facility the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature controlled room 20 22 C. with a 12 h light dark cycle before any treatment. Compound 1h was administered intravenously i.v. into the jugular vein catheters at a dose of 2.5 mg kg in DMSO PEG300 2 8 whereas 5Ha and 5Hc were dosed at 5 mg kg in DMSO PEG300 1 9 . An equal volume of heparinized saline was injected to replace the removed blood and blood samples 250 L were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 10 20 30 min and 1 2 4 8 12 24 h. Compounds 1h 5Ha and 5Hc were given p.o. by oral gavage at 10 mg kg in Tween80 DMSO HO 2 1 7 . All blood samples 250 L after oral administration were collected via the jugular vein catheters at 30 60 90 min 120 min 150 min 180 min 210 min 240 min and 8 12 24 h. Heparinized syringes and vials were prepared prior to blood collection. Plasma samples were prepared by centrifuging the blood samples at 8 000 g for 5 min. All plasma samples were stored immediately at 80 C. until analyzed.

Analytes were extracted from 100 L of plasma with 200 L of acetonitrile containing 200 nM the internal standard 3 5 dimethoxyphenyl 2 phenyl 1H imidazol 4 yl methanone . The samples were thoroughly mixed centrifuged and the organic extract was transferred to autosampler for LC MS MS analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring MRM mode scanning m z 356 188 compound 1h m z 371 203 compound 5Ha m z 389 221 compound 5Hc and m z 309 171 the internal standard was used to obtain the most sensitive signals. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non compartmental analysis WinNonlin Pharsight Corporation Mountain View Calif. 

Many established tubulin targeting anticancer drugs like taxanes and vinblastine require intravenous administration because of low oral bioavailability. Oral bioavailability is a complex parameter involving many chemical and physiological processes such as solubility permeability and metabolic stability. The solubility of these tubulin inhibitors was improved by inserting an amino linker between the A and B rings as in 5a d Table 3 demonstrates that the NH bridged compounds 5a c had similar potency 35 65 nM as 1h with increased solubility 15 and 19 g mL for 5a and 5c respectively but they are over 20 fold more active than ABT 751 Table 3 and for the structure of ABT 751 .

Rat pharmacokinetic studies were performed to study whether these new compounds exhibited improved bioavailability compared to compound 1h Table 4 . The data clearly showed that 5Hc HCl salt of 5c exhibited more than 4.3 fold increased exposure AUC by the oral route as compared to 1h suggesting that improved aqueous solubility by the amino linker successfully improved oral bioavailability. In addition the maximal concentration Cmax of 5Ha and 5Hc by oral administration was 814 and 1262 ng mL respectively. While Cmax of 1h was only 212 ng mL. Overall the bioavailability of 5Ha and 5Hc was increased from 3.3 of 1h to 11 and 21 respectively Table 4 . Compound 5Hc exhibited moderate clearance moderate volume of distribution and acceptable oral bioavailability. This data suggested that these new synthesized amino linked compounds have the potency and PK profile to be developed as a new class of orally bioavailable antitubulin agents.

Bovine brain tubulin 0.4 mg 97 pure Cytoskeleton Denver Colo. was mixed with 10 M of the test compounds and incubated in 100 l of general tubulin buffer 80 mM PIPES 2.0 mM MgCl 0.5 mM EGTA and 1 mM GTP at pH 6.9. The absorbance of wavelength at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 20 min by the SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader Bio Tek Instruments Winooski Vt. . The spectrophotometer was set at 37 C. for tubulin polymerization.

The inhibition of tubulin polymerization by selected potent compounds 1c 2j 66a and 5a was investigated by all three design strategies alternative B rings novel linkers and solubilizing moieties and compared with 1h. Bovine brain tubulin 97 pure was incubated with the individual compounds 10 M to test their effect on tubulin polymerization . After 20 min incubation tubulin polymerization was inhibited 47 by 1h as compared to vehicle. Both 1c and 2j inhibited 64 of polymerization at 20 min with different inhibition patterns. Compounds 5a and 66a provided greater inhibitions as 78 and 81 respectively. These data suggest that these compounds exhibit strong antitubulin polymerization activity that corresponds well with their cytotoxicity.

The inhibition of tubulin polymerization by compound 5c by binding with colchicines binding site and compared with compound 1h is demonstrated in and

The P glycoprotein P gp system appears to be a primary physiological mechanism of multidrug resistance MDR which acts as an ATP dependent drug efflux pump actively removing a variety of structurally diverse cytotoxic compounds. Enhanced efflux of these compounds reduces their intracellular accumulation and so reduces their cytotoxicity. Therefore novel compounds which are not susceptible to drug resistance could be of high therapeutic and economic value. In addition to P gp clinically used antitubulin agents have other resistance mechanisms such as changes in microtubule dynamics and mutations in tubulin which are known to limit sensitivity to the taxanes. The anti tubulin compounds of the invention were tested against an ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR 8 parent and P gp over expressing NCI ADR RES cell line Tables 5A 5B .

Notably the anti tubulin compounds of the invention demonstrated equipotent antiproliferative effects against OVCAR 8 and NCI ADR RES cell lines suggesting that they are not P gp substrates and that they function in a P gp independent manner. This feature is distinct from that of paclitaxel vinblastine and colchicine in NCI ADR RES cells.

The phenyl amino thiazole compounds 5a 5Hb 5c and 5d demonstrated potent activity in a number of prostate cancer cell lines. Unexpectedly the phenyl amino imidazole compound 5e demonstrated no activity IC 1000 nM in LNCaP PC 3 DU 145 and PPC 1 in these prostate cancer cell lines. The positive controls for this experiment were 55 and 17ya which demonstrated ICvalues between 7.5 nM and 24.1 nM in the same cell lines Table 5C .

A new series of tubulin polymerization inhibitors with acceptable oral bioavailability and equi potent activity in multidrug resistant tumor cell lines has been discovered. Medicinal chemistry efforts starting from optimizing SMART compound 1h. Chemical modifications of different substituted aryl in B ring and linkages between B and C rings were investigated based on biological evaluation against cancer cells in vitro. SAR studies revealed that optimal B rings include pyridine 1c thiophene 1f and furan 1d which maintain excellent in vitro potency. Replacing carbonyl linker with cyanoimine 2j between B and C ring will increase the activity. Structure modifications to increase aqueous solubility and bioavailability were performed. Introducing an amino between A and B rings gave us compounds 5a c which showed similar in vitro antiproliferative potency against tested cancer cells as well as MDR and MDR cell lines furthermore the solubility and in vivo bioavailability were improved greatly over those of the 1h. Therefore these new anti tubulin compounds represent a new family of compounds that may be very useful in the treatment of cancer.

The antiproliferative activity of analogs prepared by the methods of the invention are shown in Tables 6 and 6A.

LNCaP PC 3 DU 145 PPC 1 MES SA and MES SA DX5 were originally obtained from ATCC Rockville Md. . All cells obtained from ATCC were immediately expanded and frozen down such that all cell lines could be restarted every 2 3 months from a frozen vial of the same batch of cells. For the in vivo xenograft studies PC 3 was authenticated at Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory Columbia Mo. within four months before studies. Inter species contamination was tested by PCR and the identity of the cell lines was verified by generating a genetic profile. MES SA and MES SA DX5 were maintained in McCoy s 5A Medium containing 2 mM L glutamine supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS . All other cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM L glutamine and 10 FBS.

The cytotoxic or antiproliferative activity of test compounds was investigated in several cell lines using the sulforhodamine B SRB assay. Cultured cells were plated into 96 well plates and incubated with medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds for 96 h. Cells were stained with SRB solution. The optical density was determined at 540 nm on a microplate reader Dynex Technologies Chantilly Va. . Plots of percent inhibition of cell growth versus drug concentration were constructed and the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50 relative to the untreated control IC was determined by nonlinear least squares regression using WinNonlin software Pharsight Corporation Cary N.C. .

Cell cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide PI staining. Treated cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 70 ice cold ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were then stained with 20 g mL of PI in the presence of RNase A 300 g mL at 37 C. for 30 min. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis core services at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center TN.

For both phase I the incubation mixture in 65 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 consisted of 1 mg mL liver microsomal proteins 3 mM NADPH and 0.5 M test compound. The concentration of methanol used for dissolving the substrate was 1 v v . Total volume of the incubation was 200 L and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 C. To generate the stability curves for test compounds different incubations were stopped at 10 20 30 60 and 90 minutes for analysis of compounds remaining. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 L ice cold acetonitrile. Subsequently the samples were then centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 min and supernatant was analyzed by LC MS MS.

Male ICR mice 5 6 weeks 20 25 g were used. For 6a 6b and 6c a dose of 5 mg kg was administered via the i.v. i.p. and p.o. route. I.v. doses were administered via the tail vein. Oral doses were administered by gavage. At each time point three to four mice were euthanized by isoflurane Baxter Healthcare Deerfield Ill. and blood samples up to 600 L each were taken from the posterior vena cava. Plasma samples were stored at 20 C. prior to analysis. Plasma proteins were precipitated by the addition of acetonitrile 150 L containing the internal standard to 100 L of mouse plasma. Samples were vortexed and then centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean vial for injection into the mass spectrometer for analysis.

PC 3 cells 2.5 10cells site plus Matrigel BD biosciences San Jose Calif. were injected subcutaneously into flanks of male nu nu mice. Tumor size was measured using calipers every 2 4 days and calculated as V 6 length width . When tumors reached a volume of approximately 100 150 mm drug treatment was initiated. The control group was treated with vehicle 20 Captex200 in Tween80 . During the treatment tumor size and body weights were measured every 2 4 days.

Whole blood was obtained from nude mice at the end of efficacy study. To count white blood cells WBC using a hemacytometer 10 L of whole blood sample was diluted with the 190 L of 2 acetic acid. With proper light adjustment the leukocytes appeared as dark dots on the hemacytometer. WBC in each sample was counted twice within one hours following dilution and average was calculated.

Efficacy and tolerability of 6b and 6c was measured in xenograft models after i.p. injection . PC 3 xenografts were treated with vehicle qd 6b 40 mg kg qd or 6c 40 mg kg qd for 3 weeks. Dosing vehicles were composed of 20 Captex200 in Tween80. The tumor volumes mm were plotted against time and are the means SD from eight animals. The tumor volumes and survival rates or body weights are shown in . The liver size g of each nude mouse was measured after 3 weeks treatment and is shown in . The number of white blood cells was counted in whole blood collected from animal after 3 weeks treatment and is shown in .

The antiproliferative activity of the ABI compounds in three melanoma cell lines A375 and WM 164 human melanoma cell line B16 F1 mouse melanoma cell line and four human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP DU 145 PC 3 and PPC 1 were studied. All these cell lines were purchased from ATCC American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. except the PPC 1 cell line. MDA MB 435 and MDA MB 435 LCCMDR1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Clarke at Georgetown University School of Medicine Washington D.C. Melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM Cellgro Mediatech Inc. Herndon Va. and prostate cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 Cellgro Mediatech Inc. Herndon Va. supplemented with 10 FBS Cellgro Mediatech . Cultures were maintained at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 CO. 1000 to 5000 cells were plated into each well of 96 well plates depending on growth rate and exposed to different concentrations of a test compound for 48 h fast growing melanoma cells or 96 h slow growing prostate cancer cells in three to five replicates. Cell numbers at the end of the drug treatment were measured by the sulforhodamine B SRB assay. Briefly the cells were fixed with 10 trichloroacetic acid and stained with 0.4 SRB and the absorbances at 540 nm were measured using a plate reader DYNEX Technologies Chantilly Va. . Percentages of cell survival versus drug concentrations were plotted and the IC concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50 of untreated control values were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism GraphPad Software San Diego Calif. .

The results of the in vitro antiproliferative activities of the compounds of this invention using three melanoma cell lines one murine melanoma cell line B16 F1 and two human metastatic melanoma cell lines A375 and WM 164 and four human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP PC 3 Du 145 and PPC 1 are summarized in Tables 11 13.

From Table 11 compounds 12aa 12ai showed moderate activity with ICvalues in the M range average of all seven cell lines . The most potent compound of this series was 12aa with an average ICvalue of 160 nM. The removal of one of the methoxy groups from the 3 4 5 trimethoxy on the C ring 12ad 12ae led to a significant loss of activity IC 10 M for 12ae and an average ICof 3.1 M for 12ad . Compound with 4 fluoro on the C ring 12af also showed relatively good activity IC 0.91 M a finding that has an important implication because replacing the trimethoxy moiety with a 4 fluoro group may provide good activity and improved metabolic stability. The position of the fluorine on the C ring was critical for activity because a shift from 4 fluoro to 3 fluoro resulted in a total loss of activity IC 10 M for 12ag compared with 0.91 M for 12af . This result suggested that a potential hydrogen bond donor is present close to the 4 position of this ring.

As clearly indicated in Table 11 the positions of the A and C rings were critical. A simple shift of the C ring moiety from position 4 to position 1 in the imidazole ring B ring resulted in total loss of activity IC 10 M for 12aba 12aaa 10a 10x 10j .

From Table 12 compounds with 3 4 5 trimethoxy and 4 fluoro substitutions on the C ring showed good activity with different substitutions on the A ring. These compounds demonstrated excellent antiproliferative activity with ICvalues as low as 8.0 nM on WM164 cell line 12da . In general compounds incorporating a single substituent on the para position of the A ring were more potent as can be seen from the activities of 12ca 12cb 12da 12db 12fa 12fb 12ga and 12gb IC 7.9 110 nM . 12db HCl salt IC 172 nM showed slightly diminished activity compared with the corresponding free base 12db IC 109 nM . Compound 12fb IC 63.7 nM with a single halogen substituent in the para position of the A and C rings demonstrated potent and was devoid of a methoxy moiety. Compounds with 3 4 5 trimethoxy substituents on the A ring lost activity completely IC 10 M for 12ea 12eb suggesting very different binding environments near the A ring and C ring. Removal of the 5 methoxy substituent from the A ring improved activity significantly IC 330 nM and 10 M for 12ha 12ea respectively . Demethylation of the 3 4 5 trimethoxy decreased activity sharply from 43 nM 12fa to 3.89 M 13fa . Similar results were observed for 13ea 12ka 12kb and 13ha due to the demethylation of substituents on either the A or C ring. Electron donating groups 4 methoxy 4 dimethylamino 4 methyl and electron withdrawing groups 4 chloro 2 trifluoromethyl on the A ring did not show substantial differences in activity. The introduction of a trifluoromethyl group at the ortho position of the A ring caused complete loss of activity IC 10 M for 12ia 12ib . The presence of a benzyloxy group at the para position of A ring IC 75 nM for 12jb resulted in a 440 fold increase in activity when compared with the para hydroxy compound 12kb IC 33 M . It is worthwhile to note that compound 12jb with the 4 fluoro in the C ring has better activity than does its counterpart 12ja which has a 3 4 5 trimethoxy group in the C ring ICis 75 nM for 12jb and 7.3 M for 12ja .

From Table 13 compounds with a phenylsulfonyl protection group attached to the nitrogen of the imidazole ring 11cb 11db 11fb 11ga 11gb 11ha 11jb were also very active with ICin the nM range Table 13 . Generally the activities of these compounds are comparable to their corresponding unprotected counterparts as exemplified by comparing the activities of 11cb 43 nM 11db 111 nM 11fb 72 nM 11ga 285 nM 11gb 87 nM 11ha 268 nM and 11jb 61 nM with their corresponding unprotected counterparts 12cb 36 nM 12db 109 nM 12fb 64 nM 12ga 131 nM 12gb 72 nM 12ha 330 nM and 12jb 75 nM . Other compounds 11ab 11ag 11ea 11eb 11hb 11ia and 11ib 1 50 M were generally much less active also in line with their counterparts 12ab 12ag 12ea 12eb 12hb 12ia and 12ib 1 50 M .

Cell cycle distribution was determined by propidium iodide PI staining. Treated cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 70 ice cold ethanol overnight. Fixed cells were then stained with 20 g mL of PI in the presence of RNase A 300 g mL at 37 C. for 30 min. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis core services at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center TN.

Reversed ABIs RABIs demonstrated by cell cycle analysis that they arrest cells in the G2 M phase. Compounds 12q 70a 70f and 70m were treated on PC3 cells for 24 h and the distribution of PI stained cells was investigated by FACS analysis. Four different concentrations 1 10 50 and 100 nM of each compound were chosen to examine the dose effect. In the vehicle treated group about 18 of PC3 cells were distributed in the G2 M phase. RABIs increased the proportion of cells in G2 M phase up to 70 approximately in a concentration dependent manner. The potency of the different concentrations in arresting cells in the G2 M phase positively correlated with in vitro cell growth inhibitory activity.

P glycoprotein Pgp mediated drug efflux represents a major mechanism for cancer cells to prevent the build up of effective anticancer intracellular drug concentrations. The activity of the ABI compounds were compared against multidrug resistant MDR melanoma cells MDA MB 435 LCCMDR1 and their parental nonresistant cancer cells MDA MB 435 . Although MDA MB 435 was originally designated as a breast cancer cell line it has been shown definitively to originate from the M14 melanoma cell line. Compounds 12da 12fb 12cb 11cb and 11fb together with other tubulin targeting agents including colchicine paclitaxel and vinblastine were tested on both the MDR melanoma cell line and its parental melanoma cell line Table 14A . Paclitaxel and vinblastine are clinically used anticancer drugs known to target cell tubulin. Although colchicine is not an FDA approved drug for cancer treatment its prodrug ZD6126 is in clinical trial for solid tumors. Bortezomib is the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor and was approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in multiple myeloma. ABT 751 is known to target the tubulin colchicine binding site. It is a promising drug candidate in clinical trial for children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Compounds 12da 12fb 12cb 11cb 11fb had much better resistance indices 3.0 for 12da 0.9 for 12fb 1.3 for 12cb 0.8 for 11cb 0.7 for 11fb than colchicine 65.8 paclitaxel 69.3 and vinblastine 27.5 . Although colchicine paclitaxel and vinblastine showed excellent activity in nonresistant melanoma cell lines 0.5 10 nM these compounds were significantly less potent in the MDR melanoma cell line 277 658 nM . In contrast 12cb 11cb 11fb had essentially equivalent potency on both MDR 15 nM 38 nM 30 nM 30 nM 35 nM for 12da 12fb 12cb 11cb and 11fb respectively and nonresistant melanoma cell lines 5 nM 41 nM 24 nM 38 nM 50 nM for 12da 12fb 12cb 11cb and 11fb respectively . Compound 12da was more active than paclitaxel and colchicine on A375 and WM 164 cells.

The results of Table 14A showed that cell line MDA MB 435 LCCMDR1 was very resistant to colchicine paclitaxel and vinblastine. But the ABIs of this invention showed equal potency to the drug resistant cell line and the sensitive parent cell line. This result strongly suggests that ABIs are not substrates for P gp. Thus they overcame the multidrug resistance found in MDA MB 435 LCCMDR1 cells. The dose response curves are shown in for 12fb 12da and 12cb. Table 14B explores further the resistance mechanisms for paclitaxel SN 38 vinblastine and colchicine as compared to the ABIs 12cb 12da and 12fb. MRP and BCRP conferred moderate resistance to paclitaxel resistance indexes of 4 and 6 respectively vinblastine resistance indexes of 6 and 5 respectively and BCRP conferred significant resistance to SN 38 resistance index of 41 . However none of the ABIs were susceptible to MRP or BCRP mediated resistance resistance indexes ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 . ABT 751 like the ABIs was not susceptible to MDR1 MRP or BCRP.

Bovine brain tubulin 0.4 mg Cytoskeleton Denver Colo. was mixed with 10 M of the test compound and incubated in 110 l of general tubulin buffer 80 mM PIPES 2.0 mM MgCl 0.5 mM EGTA and 1 mM GTP at pH 6.9. The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored every 1 min for 15 min by the SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader Bio Tek Instruments Winooski Vt. . The spectrophotometer was set at 37 C. for tubulin polymerization.

The inhibition of tublin polymerization by Aryl Benzoyl Imidazole ABI compounds was examined. Bovine brain tubulin 97 pure was incubated with three potent ABI compounds 12cb 12da and 12db at a concentration of 10 M to determine the effect of these ABI compounds on tubulin polymerization . Tubulin polymerization was completely inhibited by compound 12da while 80 inhibition was observed during incubation with compounds 12cb and 12db.

This microtubule destabilization effect was similar to that of colchicine and vinblastine but was opposite to that of paclitaxel. The results not only confirmed that ABIs can directly interact with tubulin but also suggested that they may share the same binding site with colchicine or vinblastine .

B16 F1 melanoma cells were plated at a colony forming density 2000 cells per well on six well plates on top of 0.8 base agar. Cells were grown in 0.4 agar together with DMEM medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic antimycotic solution at 37 C. in an atmosphere of 95 air and 5 CO. Cells were treated with compounds 12da 12cb and 12fb at different concentrations 20 100 and 500 nM . Compounds were added to the media from 1 mM DMSO stock solutions and a corresponding dilution of DMSO was used as control. Cells were grown for 14 days. Plates were photographed and the number of colonies was measured by Artek 880 Automated Colony Counter Artek Systems Corporation Farmingdale N.Y. .

Four representative photos are shown in . After 14 days of incubation about 130 detectable colonies diameter larger than 100 m were formed in controls no treatment .

Compounds 12cb and 12da effectively inhibited B16 F1 melanoma colony formation even at the lowest tested concentration 20 nM p

Female C57 BL mice age 4 6 weeks were purchased from Harlan Laboratories Harlan Laboratories Inc. Indianapolis Ind. . The animal housing met the Association for Assessment and Accreditation and Laboratory Animal Care specifications. All of the procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines of our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Mouse melanoma B16 F1 cells were prepared in FBS free DMEM medium Cellgro Mediatech at a concentration of 5 10viable cells mL. The cell suspension 100 L was injected subcutaneously in the right dorsal flank of each mouse. When tumor size reached about 100 150 mm about 7 days after cell inoculation all mice bearing tumors were divided into control and treatment groups based on tumor size n 5 per group . Each group had similar average tumor size. Mice in control groups negative control were injected intraperitoneally with 50 L vehicle solution only or DTIC at 60 mg kg positive control once daily. Tumor volume was measured every 2 days with a traceable electronic digital caliper Fisher Scientific Inc. Pittsburgh Pa. and calculated using the formula a b 0.5 where a and b represented the larger and smaller diameters respectively. Tumor volume was expressed in cubic millimeters. Data were expressed as mean SE for each group and plotted as a function of time. Percentage tumor reduction at the conclusion of the experiment 14 days after starting treatment was calculated with the formula 100 100 T T C C where T represents mean tumor volume of a treated group on a specific day Trepresents mean tumor volume of the same group on the first day of treatment C represents mean tumor volume of a control on a specific day and Crepresents mean tumor volume of the same group on the first day of treatment. Animal activity and average body weight of each group were monitored during the entire experiment period to assess compound toxicity. At the end of treatment all mice were euthanized by COfollowed by cervical dislocation and tumors were harvested for further studies.

To evaluate efficacy of ABI analogs in vivo we tested the antitumor activity of compound 12cb on mice melanoma B16 F1 xenograft against DTIC the gold standard in malignant melanoma treatment was used as a positive control . Twenty female C57 BL mice were divided into four groups a vehicle control group a DTIC 60 mg kg treatment group a 12cb 10 mg kg treatment group and a 12cb 30 mg kg treatment group. Each mouse was injected with 0.5 million B16 F1 melanoma cells subcutaneously. Seven days after tumor inoculation treatment started with each compound injected intraperitoneally daily . Tumor volume was significantly p

Two dose levels of 12fb 15 and 45 mg kg were chosen. DTIC at 60 mg kg was used as a positive control. B16 F1 melanoma allograft model on C57BL 6 mice was first chosen for study. After 13 days of treatment compound 12fb inhibited melanoma tumor growth TGI value by 32 at 15 mg kg and 82 at 45 mg kg. Student s t test p value of 12fb at 45 mg kg compared with control was less than 0.001 indicating a significant difference. The t test p value of 12fb at 15 mg kg compared with control was 0.08 suggesting that this dose was not effective. Comparing 12fb at 45 mg kg with DTIC at 60 mg kg which had a TGI of 51 the t test p value was about 0.001 suggesting that 12fb had substantially better activity than did DTIC. For the control and 12fb 15 mg kg treatment groups average body weight increased slightly throughout the experiment period.

To further confirm ABIs in vivo activity A375 human melanoma xenograft model on SHO mice was used and 12fb at 25 mg kg was tested. DTIC at 60 mg kg was used as a positive control again. After 31 days of treatment 12fb inhibited melanoma tumor growth TGI value by 69 whereas DTIC inhibited growth by 52 . The t test p value of 12fb treatment versus control was less than 0.001 suggesting that 12fb significantly inhibited melanoma tumor growth at 25 mg kg. The t test p value of 12fb treatment versus DTIC was less than 0.05 suggesting again that 12fb had better activity than did DTIC. Average body weight of all groups increased slightly throughout the experiment period. Physical activities for the mice also looked normal suggesting that 25 mg kg was a well tolerated dose for SHO mice.

Each test compound was prepared at 20 concentration in G PEM buffer Cytoskeleton Inc. Denver Colo. followed by pipetting 10 L of test compound into the 96 well plates. Ten microliters of tritiated labeled colchicine Perkin Elmer Waltham Mass. was added to each testing well. Subsequently 180 L bead tubulin GE Healthcare Bio Sciences Corp. Piscataway N.J. suspension was added into each well. The plate was incubated for 45 min at 37 C. before it was read by a Topcount NXT plate reader Perkin Elmer Waltham Mass. . Nonradiolabeled cold colchicine was included as a positive control and paclitaxel as a negative control because paclitaxel binds to a different site in tubulin and does not compete for the colchicine site binding. Data were processed using GraphPad Prism software.

Flow cytometry analysis was performed to study cell cycle phase distribution. A375 cells were cultured in 10 cm tissue culture dishes until the confluence was about 80 and then cells were treated with 0 10 50 200 and 1000 nM of colchicine 12da 12fb and 12cb for 24 h in growth media. Cellular DNA was stained with PBS containing 50 g mL propidium iodide and 100 g mL RNase A.

Three ligand binding sites in tubulin heterodimer have been reported paclitaxel binding site vinblastine binding site and colchicine binding site. The binding affinity of compound 12cb using H labeled colchicine and a competitive binding scintillation proximity assay SPA was measured. The results confirmed the strong binding of 12cb with a binding affinity of 3.4 1.5 M . Colchicine bound tubulin with an ICvalue of 1.8 0.5 M under these conditions. These results clearly indicated that ABI compounds effectively inhibit tubulin polymerization.

The binding graph clearly shows that ABIs can competitively bind to the tubulin colchicine binding site. As the concentration of the three tested compounds increased from 0.03 M to 100 M increased tritiated colchicine was competitively stripped away from tubulin and emitted lower SPA counts. The negative control paclitaxel gave only a flat line because theoretically it should not bind to the colchicine binding site on tubulin. Second ABIs have relatively high binding affinity to the tubulin colchicine binding site. GraphPad Prism calculated ICvalues for binding showed that 12da has the highest binding affinity. The binding affinity was positively correlated to in vitro antimelanoma activity the higher the binding affinity the higher the antimelanoma activity.

ABIs demonstrated that they arrest cells by cell cycle analysis in the G2 M phase as indication that they target tubulin. Compounds 12da 12fb and 12cb were tested together with colchicine as a positive control on A375 cells . Four different concentrations 10 50 200 and 1000 nM of each compound were chosen to show the dose effect . For controls no treatment without interference about 16 of A375 cells were distributed in the G2 M phase. For the colchicine treatment group as concentration increased from 10 nM to 50 nM the percentage of cells distributed in the G2 M phase increased from 14 to 85 . ABIs had similar results for A375 cells in arresting them in the G2 M phase in a dose dependent manner. The potency of the different concentrations in arresting cells in the G2 M phase positively correlated with in vitro activity.

Male ICR mice n 3 per group 6 to 8 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan Inc. and used to examine the pharmacokinetics PK of 17ya 12fa and 55. All compounds 10 mg kg were dissolved in DMSO PEG300 1 9 and administered by a single intravenously i.v. injection 50 L into the tail vein. Blood samples were collected at 5 15 and 30 min 1 1.5 2 3 4 8 12 and 24 h after i.v. administration. Mice were given p.o. by oral gavage at 20 mg kg in Tween80 DMSO HO 2 2 6 of each test compound to evaluate their oral bioavailability. Blood samples were collected at 0.5 1 1.5 2 3 4 8 12 and 24 h after p.o. administration.

Female Sprague Dawley rats n 3 254 4 g were purchased from Harlan Inc. Indianapolis Ind. . Rat thoracic jugular vein catheters were purchased from Braintree Scientific Inc. Braintree Mass. . On arrival at the animal facility the animals were acclimated for 3 days in a temperature controlled room 20 22 C. with a 12 h light dark cycle before any treatment. Compounds 17ya 12fa and 55 were administered i.v. into the thoracic jugular vein at a dose of 5 mg kg in DMSO PEG300 1 9 . An equal volume of heparinized saline was injected to replace the removed blood and blood samples 250 L were collected via the jugular vein catheter at 10 20 30 min and 1 2 4 8 12 24 h. Rats were given p.o. by oral gavage at 10 mg kg in Tween80 DMSO HO 2 2 6 of each test compound to evaluate their oral bioavailability. All blood samples 250 L after oral administration were collected via the jugular vein catheter at 30 60 90 min 120 min 150 min 180 min 210 min 240 min and 8 12 24 h.

PC 3 TxR cells 10 10per mL were prepared in RPMI1640 growth media containing 10 FBS and mixed with Matrigel BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. at 1 1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 L of the mixture 5 10cells per animal subcutaneously s.c. into the flank of 6 8 week old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume mm was calculated by the formula 6 L W where length L and width W were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 300 mm the animals bearing PC 3 TxR tumors were treated with vehicle Tween80 DMSO HO 2 2 6 or 17ya 10 mg kg orally. The dosing schedule was 3 times a week for four weeks.

The ability of 17ya and 55 to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines was evaluated using SRB assay Table 15 . Both compounds inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines including five prostate and one glioma cancer cell lines with ICvalues in the low nanomolar range. 17ya exhibited 1.7 4.3 fold higher potency than 55 in these cell lines. Paclitaxel resistant PC 3 PC 3 TxR cell line that over expresses P glycoprotein P gp was used to study the effect of drug resistance on 17ya and 55 and to compare against its parent PC 3 cell line. The ICvalues of docetaxel were 1.2 0.1 nM and 17.7 0.7 nM in PC 3 and PC 3 TxR cells respectively. 17ya and 55 were both equipotent against parent PC 3 and PC 3 TxR whereas paclitaxel and docetaxel exhibited relative resistance of 85 and 15 fold respectively. These data indicate that both 17ya and 55 circumvent P gp mediated drug resistance.

17ya and 55 Bind to Colchicine Binding Site on Tubulin Inhibit Tubulin Polymerization and Induce Cell Apoptosis .

A competitive mass binding assay was developed to study the interaction of small molecule inhibitors with tubulin. In this study varying concentrations of 17ya or 55 were used to compete with colchicine tubulin binding. Both compounds competed effectively with colchicine for tubulin binding however their competitive binding curves deviated substantially from zero at higher concentrations when compared to podophylltoxin a known potent colchicine site binding ligand. This suggests that both 17ya and 55 exhibited less affinity than podophylltoxin or they partially bind to the colchicine binding site. Vinblastine the negative control did not inhibit the colchicine tubulin binding successfully demonstrating the specificity of this competitive mass binding assay

Porcine brain tubulin 97 pure was incubated with 17ya or 55 5 M to test their effect on tubulin polymerization . 17ya and 55 inhibited tubulin polymerization by 47 and 40 at 15 min respectively. Colchicine at 5 M was used as a positive control and inhibited tubulin polymerization by 32 . These data suggest that both 17ya and 55 have slightly greater inhibition of tubulin polymerization than colchicine. Therefore the molecular mechanism of these compounds is binding to the colchicine binding site inhibiting tubulin polymerization and inducing cytotoxicity.

PC 3 and PC 3 TxR cells were exposed to 0.8 to 600 nmol L of 17ya 55 or docetaxel for 24 h. The levels of DNA histone complexes were used to represent cell apoptosis. Both 17ya and 55 were equally potent to induce cell apoptosis in PC 3 and PC 3 TxR in 24 h. Though docetaxel was highly potent to induce apoptosis of PC 3 cells it was weaker in PC 3 TxR cells due to over expression of P gp.

Drug like properties such as metabolic stability permeability aqueous solubility and drug drug interactions were examined for 17ya and 55 Table 16A . 17ya exhibited greater metabolic stability and aqueous solubility than 55. Both chemicals exhibited more than adequate permeability values suggesting their potential to be orally used. In addition both 17ya and 55 showed high ICvalues in micromolar range on CYP enzyme inhibition assays indicating that both compounds may avoid drug drug interactions through main CYP liver enzymes. Overall both compounds exhibited favorable drug like properties.

As shown in Table 16B 17ya had a half life of 80 min by phase I reaction suggesting that 17ya was stable in phase I metabolic processes. The half life 90 min in the presence of UDP glucuronic acid was similar to that observed in its absence. These data suggested that 17ya is stable in human liver microsomes and it was hoped that low clearance and long half life will be obtained in human. On the other hand 55 exhibited 30 and 43 min as half lives when it was in the presence and absence of UDP glucuronic acid respectively. Compound 12fa shows the half life with 44 in phase I. These data suggested that all three compounds showed acceptable stability in human liver microsomes and 17ya is more stable than 12fa and 55. When investigating their metabolism it was found that 12fa and 55 exhibited higher levels of ketone reduction data not shown suggesting that 12fa and 55 are more labile than 17ya.

Compound 17ya contained an imidazole ring and this ring improved aqueous solubility resulting in 75 g mL aqueous solubility Table 16A . Compounds 12fa and 55 exhibited less aqueous solubility and exhibited 12 and 19 g mL respectively. Overall 17ya demonstrated a great aqueous solubility and 12fa and 55 showed acceptable aqueous solubility and much improved over 1h. The greater solubility of 12fa translated into much improved oral bioavailability compared to 1h 35 vs. 3.3 in rat . Similarly for 17ya and 55 aqueous solubility correlated with much improved oral bioavailability as discussed infra Table 17 .

The pharmacokinetic parameters of 17ya and 55 given in a single i.v. or p.o. dose in ICR mice Sprague Dawley rats and beagle dogs are summarized in Table 17. 17ya exhibited low clearance in mice and rats suggesting that 17ya exhibited metabolic stability and minimal first pass metabolism in these species. In addition 17ya had moderate volume of distribution in mice and rats indicating that it may properly distribute into tissues including tumors. Unlike in mice and rats surprisingly the total clearance of 17ya in dogs was high. Two abundant metabolites in dog plasma a hydroxylated metabolite and an unknown metabolite with 34 m z of the parent data not shown were consistent with those found in dog liver microsomes. In summary higher clearance and lower oral exposure was obtained for 17ya compared to 55 in dogs but not in mice and rats. In addition 17ya exhibited abundant metabolites only in dog liver microsomes but not in mouse rat or human liver microsomes data not shown . 17ya showed acceptable 21 36 and 50 oral bioavailability in rats mice and dogs respectively. Meanwhile 55 had low clearance in rats and moderate clearance in mice and dogs. Similar to 17ya 55 exhibited moderate volume of distribution in these species. 55 had constant oral bioavailability rates among three species 24 36 . These properties indicate that both 17ya and 55 are potential orally available tubulin inhibitors.

PC 3 and paclitaxel resistant prostate cancer PC 3 TxR cells were inoculated in nude mice and the tumor volumes were allowed to reach about 150 300 mm. Docetaxel 10 or 20 mg kg which is in clinic for prostate cancer was used to evaluate its effectiveness in models of P gp mediated drug resistance in vivo. PC 3 TxR tumor was found to be fast growing and the volume reached 1500 2500 mmat the termination of the study. Though 10 and 20 mg kg intravenously administered docetaxel exhibited a dose response in both models the tumor growth inhibition TGI effect decreased from 84 TGI in PC 3 tumors to 14 TGI in PC 3 TxR tumors when intravenously dosed at 10 mg kg Table 18 . In addition at the higher dose 20 mg kg docetaxel elicited partial regression 100 TGI of PC 3 tumors but barely 56 TGI in PC 3 TxR tumors. The effectiveness of docetaxel in PC 3 TxR tumors was dramatically decreased when compared to that in PC 3 tumors suggesting that the efficacy was impaired by P gp mediated drug resistance and these results are in very good agreement with our in vitro cytotoxicity or apoptosis data. In contrast to the lack of efficacy of docetaxel in PC 3 TxR tumors orally administered 17ya 6.7 mg kg demonstrated more than 100 TGI without an effect on their body weights and Table 18 . In addition 2 out of 4 nude mice bearing PC 3 TxR tumors were tumor free on day 19 data not shown .

The PC 3 TxR xenograft model was further utilized to evaluate efficacies of 17ya in other dosing schedules and 55. The maximal tolerated dose body weight loss 20 of 17ya was found to be 10 mg kg when orally dosed once daily for four days or at 3.3 mg kg twice a day b.i.d. for five days data not shown . As shown in 3.3 mg kg of 17ya was dosed b.i.d. for first consecutive four days in the first week and the schedule was then changed to once daily between weeks 2 and 4. The result shows that partial regression was obtained during day 4 19 and the TGI was 97 and one of the seven mice was tumor free on day 26. Higher dose 10 mg kg with lower dosing frequency q2d of 17ya elicited partial regression during days 13 to 29. These data suggest that regimens with optimized doses and dosing schedules will facilitate 17ya to successfully inhibit PC 3 TxR tumors. 55 was orally administered to nude mice with 10 or 30 mg kg b.i.d. and five times a week between weeks 1 and 4. As shown in the inhibition profiles exhibit a dose response in PC 3 TxR tumor. The TGI value was 59 for the treatment group with a lower dose 10 mg kg . Moreover the higher dose 30 mg kg started to show partial regression 100 TGI from day 19 to the termination of the study day 26 . Some mice in the vehicle group lost body weight at the endpoint in part due to cancer cachexia. On the contrary mice treated with 17ya 3.3 mg kg or 55 30 mg kg were gaining weight Table 18 suggesting that these optimized doses of 17ya or 55 may be well tolerated and were preventive of cancer cachexia.

Whole brain concentrations in nude mice at 1 h and 4 h after oral administration of 20 mg kg 17ya or 55 were determined Table 19 . The ratios of brain to plasma concentrations were determined and compared to docetaxel in the nude mice. 55 exhibited greater brain penetration than 17ya and docetaxel. 17ya only exhibited slightly greater brain plasma concentration ratios than docetaxel at both 1 and 4 h. The brain concentrations of 55 reached 14 to 19 of plasma concentrations at 1 h and 4 h respectively showing a 3.2 fold higher brain plasma ratio at both 1 h and 4 h compared to docetaxel. These data suggest that 55 exhibited potentially favorable properties to treat glioma since it has greater brain penetration and high potency 22 nM Table 15 in glioma cells.

Blood samples were collected at 2 5 15 and 30 min 1 2 4 8 16 and 24 hr after administration. Male Sprague Dawley rats n 4 254 4 g were purchased from Harlan Inc. Indianapolis Ind. . 1h 2k were administered intravenously into the jugular venous catheters at 2.5 mg kg in DMSO PEG300 1 4 . Blood samples 250 L were collected at 10 20 30 min and 1 2 4 8 12 24 48 h. A protein precipitation method was used for sample preparation. An aliquot 200 L of acetonitrile ACN was added to 100 L of plasma and then was thoroughly vortexed for 15 s. After centrifugation the supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LC MS MS . The PK parameters were determined using Non compartment analysis WinNonlin Pharsight Corporation Mountain View Calif. .

PC 3 and A375 cells 5 10per mL were prepared in phenol red free growth media containing 10 FBS and mixed with Matrigel BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. at 1 1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 L of the mixture 2.5 10cells per animal subcutaneously s.c. into the flank of 6 8 week old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume mm was calculated by the formula 6 L W where length L and width W were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 150 mm the animals bearing PC 3 tumors were treated with vehicle Captex200 Tween80 1 4 1h 5 and 15 mg kg 2k 5 and 15 mg kg and 2l 50 mg kg intraperitorally for 21 days. Vinblastine 0.5 mg kg was used as the positive control and dosed q2d with vehicle DMSO PEG300 1 9 . On the other hand A375 tumor bearing mice were treated for 34 days with vehicle Captex200 Tween80 1 4 1h 20 mg kg or 2k 15 mg kg . Doses were selected based on acute toxicity studies of 1h and 2k in ICR mice n 2 group showing that doses up to 30 mg kg and 15 mg kg respectively did not cause greater than 10 loss of body weight after 4 consecutive days of intraperitoneal dosing.

In Vivo Antitumor Activity Tumor Growth Inhibition T C Tumor Growth Delay T C Value and Tumor Cell Kill Total Log Cell Kill .

Evidence of drug effect is described by the following parameters T C tumor volume of treated group tumor volume of control group 100 . The T C values tumor growth delay were based on the median time in days required for the treatment T and the control group C tumors to reach a predetermined size 600 mmin this study . These values were then used for the quantitation of the tumor cell kill following the equation log cell kill T C 3.32 Td . Td is the tumor volume doubling time in days. In this study we defined the doubling time required for the tumor to increase from 300 to 600 mm.

ICR mice received training three times a day for two days to enable them to stay on the rotating rod for 120 seconds at 12 rpm. Mice were then randomized by the length of time that they could stay on the rotating rod and divided into 7 8 mice per group. 1h at a dose of 5 or 15 mg kg in Captex200 Tween80 1 4 was administered by intraperitoneal injection. Vinblastine at a dose of 0.5 mg kg day was used as a positive control under the same conditions. The rotarod test was performed twice a week. Treatment was stopped on day 31 and post observation was examined on weeks 1 2 and 4 after termination of the treatment. The rod speed was increased from 59 rpm to 40 rpm over a period of 5 min. Performance was measured as the length of time that a mouse could stay on the rotating rod.

At the end of the PC 3 xenograft studies solid tumors from control and 1h treated 15 mg kg groups were removed and digested with 0.1 collagenase Type I and 50 mg mL DNAse Worthington Biochemical Corp. Freehold N.J. . Dispersed cells were plated in RPMI medium 10 FBS and incubated at 37 C. and 5 COfor 24 hr to allow attachment. The antiproliferative effects of 1h were compared to determine whether tumor cells remaining in PC 3 xenografts retained sensitivity to drug. The PC 3 cells obtained from ATCC were used as in vitro control. Statistical analyses were performed using simple t Test.

Based on structure activity relationship studies three compounds were selected for biological characterization. While 1h and 2k are highly potent molecules with low nanomolar cytotoxic properties 2l which was rationally designed as a potential metabolite with improved solubility had the least potent antiproliferative effects Table 21 .

Bovine brain tubulin 97 pure was incubated with the individual compounds 10 M to test their effect on tubulin polymerization . While 1h and 2k inhibited tubulin polymerization by 90 2l inhibited the polymerization by only 55 . Previous studies demonstrated a concentration dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerization by 1h. In addition under the same experimental conditions the ICfor 1h 4.23 M is similar to that of colchicine 4.91 M . These data suggest that the compounds exhibit strong antitubulin polymerization activity that corresponds well with their cytotoxicity Table 21 . The ability of the compounds to compete for known binding sites on tubulin was determined using a novel MS competitive binding assay which was developed in our laboratory. Three tubulin ligands corresponding to the three binding sites on tubulin colchicine vinblastine and paclitaxel were used for these competitive binding studies. It was found that over a concentration range of 0.1 125 M 1h specifically competed with colchicine binding to tubulin but it did not compete with either vinblastine or paclitaxel binding to tubulin .

The ability of the compounds to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines was evaluated using the SRB assay. As shown in Table 21 the compounds inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines including four prostate cancer cell lines and two melanoma cell lines with ICvalues in the low nanomolar range. Out of the three compounds 2l was the least potent IC76 116 nM . 2k exhibited the best antiproliferative effect with ICvalues between 6 and 43 nM in prostate cancer and melanoma cell lines. In addition the effect of the compounds in the OVCAR 8 and NCI ADR RES cell lines was also evaluated Table 21 . The compounds were equally potent against MDR cell NCI ADR RES and the parent cell line OVCAR 8 . Paclitaxel vinblastine and colchicine exhibited relative resistance values of 1333 149 and 65 times respectively Table 21 . These data indicate that the compounds circumvent P gp mediated drug resistance.

SMART Compounds Arrest PC 3 Prostate and A375 Melanoma Cells in G2 1M Phase of Cell Cycle and Induce Cell Apoptosis.

PC 3 and A375 cells were exposed to 10 50 200 and 1000 nM of the compounds for 24 h. Treatment with the SMART compounds resulted in concentration dependent accumulation of both PC 3 and A375 cells in the G2 M phase with concomitant decreases in the percentage of cells in G0 G1 phase . The proportion of cells in G2 M phase significantly increased when treated with 50 to 200 nM of 1h 2k 2l. Apoptosis was then examined by measuring the level of cytoplasmic DNA histone complexes in PC 3 and A375 cells after 24 h treatment. Increasing concentration of the SMART compounds increased the level of cytoplasmic DNA histone complexes in PC 3 and A375 cells . The effect was more pronounced in A375 cells than PC 3 cells but apoptosis was evident in both cell types. 1h and 2k induced moderate apoptosis at a concentration of 50 nM while 2l induced apoptosis only at concentrations greater than or equal to 200 nM.

A single dose bolus of each compound 15 mg kg was administered by tail vein injection to ICR mice to characterize their pharmacokinetics . 1h and 2k exhibited similar PK properties but 2l exhibited slightly greater AUC than 1h and 2k indicative of a lower clearance for 2l Table 22 . 2l also had 2 3 times higher Vthan that of 1h and 2k. The clearance values for all three compounds were equal to or higher than 90 mL min kg the hepatic blood flow rate in mice suggesting that in addition to hepatic removal other degradation routes may be involved in the elimination of the compounds. The pharmacokinetics of 1h and 2k 2.5 mg kg were also examined in rats . Interestingly low clearance values and hepatic extraction rates were obtained by both compounds suggesting that these compounds exhibit species differences in clearance. In rats 1h exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties which are low clearance 6 mL min kg moderate volume of distribution 7.6 L kg long half life 24 hr and high exposure AUC 5.8 hr g mL Table 22 when administered iv.

Prostate cancer PC 3 and melanoma A375 tumors in mice were allowed to reach a volume of 150 mmand then tumor bearing mice were treated with the SMART compounds. As shown in tumor volumes in the control group increased to 680 mmover the 21 day duration of the study. Tumor volumes in the 1h treated group increased to 370 mm 5 mg kg treatment and 176 mm 15 mg kg treatment by day 21 indicating strong anti tumor activity for this compound. Tumors in the 2k treated animals increased to 269 mm 5 mg kg treatment and 292 mm 15 mg kg treatment while animals in the 2l 50 mg kg treated group had tumors of 331 mmat day 21. This reduction in tumor volume reversed upon withdrawal of SMART compounds data not shown . Table 23 summarized the in vivo efficacy T C T C values and log cell kill of SMART compounds.

1h tumor elicited T C 29 and 4 at 5 and 15 mg kg treatment all doses were intraperitoneal i.p. respectively whereas 2k elicited T C of 21 and 24 at 5 and 15 mg kg treatment respectively. The high dose of 2l 50 mg kg exhibited the T C of 34 . Vinblastine the positive control showed T C of 29 at day 22 in PC 3 xenografts . Body weight measurements to monitor toxicity indicated that only 1 of 8 mice treated with 1h 15 mg kg and 2 out of 7 mice treated with 2k 15 mg kg lost more than 15 body weight. In addition to the antitumor effects of the compounds on PC 3 prostate tumors 1h 20 mg kg and 2k 15 mg kg demonstrated a significant reduction of A375 tumors. As shown in the tumor volumes of control group increased to 2183 mm whereas the 14 volumes in 1h and 2k treatment groups increased to 775 mmand 722 mm respectively. 1h and 2k treatment evoked T C of 28 and 29 respectively. Rotarod tests were performed to examine the in vivo neurotoxic effects of 1h. Based on the result of in vivo efficacy experiments 5 or 15 mg kg i.p. administration Captex200 Tween80 1 4 of 1h was chosen to study the effect on motor coordination. A 0.5 mg kg treatment with vinblastine was used as the positive control under the same conditions. As shown in vinblastine gradually reduced the time in seconds that the mice could stay on the rotating rod and attained significance by days 27 and 31 p

We excised the PC 3 tumors from nude mice after 21 days of treatment with vehicle n 3 or 15 mg kg 1h n 3 . Solid tumors were digested and dispersed into cells as described in the methods section. PC 3 cell line from ATCC American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA was used as a control. ICvalues were 29.1 1.1 29.1 0.8 and 30.4 0.5 nM in PC 3 cells from ATCC and dissociated cells from vehicle and 1h treated tumors respectively. These data demonstrate that 1h did not induce drug resistance in PC 3 tumors after 21 days of continuous 1h treatment.

All molecular modeling studies were performed with Schr dinger Molecular Modeling Suite 2008 Schr dinger LLC New York N.Y. running on a Dell Linux workstation. Because the size of ABI compounds are much closer to that of ABT 751 rather than DAMA colchichine we selected tubulin complex with ABT 751 PDB code 3 KHC as our modeling system. ABIs were built and prepared using the Ligprep module and they were docked into the ABT 751 site using the Glide module in Schr dinger Suite. The best docking complexes were subject to restricted molecular dynamics to release any strains using Macromodel module with OPLS 2005 forcefield. The ligand and its surrounding residues within 15 were allowed to move freely while residues outside the 15 radius were kept rigid.

Molecular modeling for binding ABI compounds in tubulin was studied. Several crystal structures of the ligand tubulin complex are available in the PDB databank with the most recent one from Dorleans et al. In general the colchicine binding pocket tolerates a variety of molecular structures which may indicate substantial conformation changes upon ligand binding. In fact Dorleans et al. solved the crystal structures of both the empty tubulin dimer and the ligand tubulin complex. They found that without the presence of ligand loop 7 T7 residues 244 251 in the beta monomer folds in to occupy the binding pocket while it flips out upon ligand binding. The associated helix 7 H7 residues 224 243 and helix 8 H8 residues 252 260 were displaced upon ligand binding. It is conceivable that the extent to which T7 is displaced depends on the size of individual ligand. This flexibility presents a significant challenge to understand the precise binding modes for individual ligands without solving actual crystal structures. Nevertheless careful analysis of the possible binding modes could provide some insights into the binding of different ligands.

The binding modes of 12cb and 11cb stick model are shown in . For comparison the crystal structure complexes of ABT 751 and DAMA colchicine wire models along with ABI 12cb tubulin complex in is displayed. For clarity only the related secondary structures forming the binding pocket in tubulin are shown in . The overall structures of 12cb ABT 751 and DAMA colchicine overlapped very well in the binding pocket. Several potential hydrogen bonding interactions between compound 12cb and tubulin were identified. The carbonyl group in 12cb was in sufficient proximity to form two hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone NH of Leu 252 in H8 and the sidechain of Asp 251 in T7 of the tubulin monomer. The para fluorine substituent in the C ring was close to the sidechain of Cys241 in T7 and Tyr202 in S6 possibly forming one or two hydrogen bonds. The imidazole proton is very close and likely to form a hydrogen bond to Thr179 in T5 loop residues 173 182 of the tubulin monomer . Together with the hydrophobic interactions provided by the aromatic rings the likely formation of these hydrogen bonds would contribute to the high binding affinity to the tubulin dimer resulting in high antiproliferative potency.

The binding mode of 11cb will be conceivably less defined since two of the three aromatic rings may occupy the binding pocket in the monomer while the third ring may extend toward the interface of the monomers similar to how the sidechain of DAMA colchicine binds. Our modeling indicates that the protecting group likely extends to the tubulin dimer interface while the A C rings of 11cb occupy similar binding pocket and orientation as 12cb . This may explain the similar activity between the two compounds even though 11cb has an extra ring system. From the molecular modeling studies presented in the hydrogen bond donor is likely to be the thiol group in Cys 241 in loop 7 of the subunit in tubulin dimer.

The binding mode of ABI 12fb was modeled not shown and compared to DAMA colchicine see for structure of colchicine in the tubulin heterodimer. The overall structure of 12fb and DAMA cochicine overlapped very well. The p fluoro phenyl moiety overlaps with the trimethoxylpheny moiety which is interacting with the T7 loop in the subunit. Similarly the p chloro phenyl moiety occupies the other side of the pocket where the seven member ring of the DAMA cochicine is with the chlorine atom occupying the pocket where the methoxy moiety interacts.

Cellomics Cytoskeleton rearrangement kit Thermo Scientific Rockford Ill. was used to get a visually appreciable proof of ABIs interacting with tubulin inside the cells. WM 164 melanoma cells were treated with each compound for 18 h in duplicate using a collagen coated 96 well plate Becton Dickinson Labware Bedford Mass. . Then cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde Thermo Scientific Rockford Ill. and permeabilized using permeabilization buffer supply from the kit. Primary antibody for tubulin and fluorescence labeled secondary antibody were subsequently added to the cells. Cell nuclei were stained by DAPI. Whole Cell Stain Green was also applied to all cells. All images were acquired with an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope Olympus Corp. Tokyo Japan with overlays from separate images of tubulin red nuclei blue and whole cells green . For comparison paclitaxel colchicine and ABT 751 along with ABIs are included.

Visual proof of ABIs interacting with tubulin inside the cells was examined. The microtubule arrangement in human melanoma WM 164 cells upon treatment with different compounds is presented in . The microtubule images clearly showed that all five tested compounds resulted in cytoskeleton rearrangement. There was a significant difference between paclitaxel and the other four compounds colchicine ABT 751 12cb and 12da . Treatment with paclitaxel resulted in a condensation of microtubules orderly lying around the nuclei compared with controls consistent with its mechanisms of action for stabilizing microtubules. On the contrary treatment with colchicine ABT 751 12cb and 12da had similar effects on microtubules and resulted in some degree of microtubule fragmentation consistent with their common mechanism of action for destabilizing microtubules. These results also confirmed that ABIs shared the same cellular target with colchicine and induced the same cellular effect.

HUVECs Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were cultured and grown in EGM 2 BulletKit Lonza Cat No. CC 3162 which contains growth supplements including hydrocortisone human fibroblast growth factor basic with heparin hFGF B vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF R3 insulin like growth factor 1 IGF 1 ascorbic acid heparin fetal bovine serum human epidermal growth factor hEGF and GA 1000 gentamicin and amphotericin B in Endothelial Cell Basal Medium 2. Cells between the third and fifth passages were used for experiments. PC 3 human prostate cancer cells and T47D human breast cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5 fetal bovine serum.

Cytotoxic or antiproliferative activity of test compounds was investigated in several cell lines using the sulforhodamine B SRB assay. Cultured cells were plated into 96 well plates and incubated in medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds for 24 h or 48 h. Cells were stained with sulphorhodamine B SRB solution. The optical density was determined at 540 nm on a microplate reader Dynex Technologies Chantilly Va. . Plots of percent inhibition of cell growth versus drug concentration were constructed and the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50 relative to the vehicle control IC was determined by nonlinear least squares regression using WinNonlin software Pharsight Corporation Cary N.C. .

Capillary formation assays were performed in 96 well plates by plating 12 000 cells well of HUVECs on a Matrigel layer BD Biosciences . In order to evaluate the anti capillary action capillaries were allowed to form over a 16 h period before the addition of test compound or vehicle control. In addition capillary formation inhibitory effect of test compound was investigated by treating HUVEC cells with test compounds before capillary formation. Images were acquired immediately following compound addition 5 10 15 and 25 h after exposure to test compound. Capillary formation was quantified by counting the number of tubes and nodes having at least three edges.

The permeability of an endothelial cell monolayer was assessed in the transwell system. HUVECs were plated at 2 10cells per insert of 24 well plate in EGM 2 medium and incubated for 72 h to reach 100 confluency. Test compounds were diluted in EGM 2 medium and added to the upper chamber of the apparatus. Following 1 2 and 4 h of incubation the compounds were removed and 75 g mL FITC conjugated dextran MW 40 000 was added for 5 minutes. Fluorescent measurements of the lower chamber were taken after excitation at 485 nm and emission was measured at 520 nm using a BioTek Synergy 4 Microplate Reader.

17ya and 55 were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against growth factor supplemented endothelial cells and growth factor deprived endothelial cell cultures. Combretastatin A 4 CA4 and doxorubicin were used as positive and negative control respectively. Compound 17ya exhibited higher potency than compound 55 against actively proliferating endothelial cells Table 24 and . Both 17ya and 55 exhibited selectivity for endothelial cells showing lower ICvalues compared to one of the prostate cancer cells. CA4 17ya and 55 were 8 5 and 3 times more active against endothelial cells than against cancer cells respectively while doxorubicin was not specific to endothelial cells Table 24 and . However no selectivity was observed between quiescent and active endothelial cells with these compounds data not shown .

The activity of 17ya was investigated on endothelial cells engaged in capillary tube formation in vitro. Endothelial cells were placed on a Matrigel matrix and the formation and construction of capillary tubes in the presence or absence of compounds were observed CA4 doxorubicin and 17ya .

To avoid confusion between early stage of tube formation and disruption of tube construction HUVEC cells on matrix in the presence of drug treatment were incubated for 15 h. Then disruption of capillary was determined by counting the number of tubes and nodes in each treatment group. On the other hand to evaluate the effect of test compound in preformed capillaries HUVEC cells on matrix were allowed to form capillary tube for 16 h and the capillaries were treated with test compounds.

As a result the number of tubes and nodes was gradually decreased over time due to deficiency or consumption of nutrient by HUVEC cells . This trend was observed in every drug treatment group . In order to examine the difference between untreated and pretreated capillaries 15 h incubation groups were compared .

Endothelial cells that were exposed to various concentrations of 17ya 0 to 50 M plated on Matrigel matrix resulted in inhibition of tube formation in a dose dependent manner. 17ya with approximate ICvalue of 5 nM in cell growth inhibition studies inhibited more than 50 of tube formation compared to vehicle control . 17ya at 10 nM completely inhibited the tube formation . However in the preformed capillaries the 10 nM 17ya treatment group did not disrupt the capillary structure by 15 h . These results suggest that 17ya inhibits the formation of endothelial capillaries significantly but is less effective to disrupt preformed capillaries. Similar result was observed in CA4 treatment group . However doxorubicin did not affect the capillary construction at toxic concentration.

Antitubulin agents could modify the integrity of endothelial cell layers lining blood vessels by targeting cytoskeleton of the endothelial cells. Thus the vascular disruption effect of antitubulin agent is known to increase the permeability of blood vessel and thus could lead to protein leakage and high blood viscosity. This could result in reduction of blood flow causing subsequent tumor death from hypoxia and nutrient deprivation.

The effect of 17ya and 55 was evaluated on vascular permeability using in vitro study using transwell system with confluent HUVEC monolayers. The change in permeability by test compound was measured by the leakage of dextran MW 40 000 after 1 2 and 4 h of drug treatment. CA4 was used as a positive control. CA4 17ya and 55 resulted in increased permeability and the effect was more pronounced at 1 h incubation data was not shown . 17ya showed a potency similar to CA4 . Doxorubicin did not induce any change in the permeability of endothelial cell monolayer .

HL60 cells 10 10per mL were prepared in RPMI1640 growth media containing 10 FBS and mixed with Matrigel BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. at 1 1 ratio. Tumors were established by injecting 100 L of the mixture 5 10cells per animal subcutaneously into the flank of 6 8 week old male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were measured and the tumor volume mm was calculated by the formula 6 L W where length L and width W were determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 200 mmapproximately the animals bearing HL60 tumors were treated with vehicle Tween80 DMSO HO 2 2 6 or 17ya 20 mg kg orally. The dosing schedule was once a week for two weeks. Vincristine 1 mg mL was administrated via intraperitoneal injection once a week.

Human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL60 cells were inoculated in nude mice and the tumor volumes were allowed to reach about 200 mm. Vincristine 1 mg kg which is in clinic for hematological cancers including leukemia was used to evaluate the response of this in vivo model against a positive control drug. The tumor volumes mm were plotted against time and are the means SD from four to five animals. HL60 tumor was found to be fast growing and the volume reached 2000 3000 mmwithin two weeks. Though 1 mg kg intraperitoneal injection of vincristine exhibited very potent tumor growth inhibitory effect and the tumor growth inhibition TGI was 84 . Orally administered 17ya 20 mg kg showed 40 tumor growth inhibition. The size of HL60 tumors was maintained up to 5 days after 17ya treatment without dramatic increase but during the next 2 days tumor sizes increased significantly 60 100 . It suggests that more a frequent dosing schedule could enhance the tumor growth inhibitory effect of 17ya.
