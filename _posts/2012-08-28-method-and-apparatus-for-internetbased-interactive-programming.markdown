This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 335 200 filed Jan. 18 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 255 966 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 123 618 filed Apr. 15 2002 now abandoned the entire contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in full herein.

This invention pertains generally to the field of interactive programming and more specifically to creating interactive programming including participants interactions.

Television has traditionally been a serial process where a television program having a series of images and sounds are broadcast to a viewer in an audience with limited opportunity for the viewer to participate in the television program. The evolution to a more interactive form of television or television where the viewer is allowed to participate was slow given the lack of bidirectional communication channels between the viewer and the television program broadcaster. When bidirectional communication channels were created they tended be of insufficient bandwidth for communication of complex viewer interactions with the television program.

Development of a nearly ubiquitous communications network namely the Internet has greatly expanded the use of interactive television. However viewer participation has so far been limited to choosing television content responding to advertising messages and answering viewer questionnaires or polls. This is primarily because most interactive television programming follows a conventional television paradigm wherein the television programming is wrapped in advertisements and the only responses needed from an audience are to watch linear pre recorded programs and to buy advertised items or services. Little has been done to fully involve the audience in a rich participatory experience where the audience has as much control and influence over the content of an interactive program as the originator of the interactive program. This is in contrast to the expectations of some viewers who want a richer and more satisfying participatory experience within the context of an interactive program.

Some interactive television formats also have a disadvantage in that although they may use the Internet as a bidirectional communication channel the interactive television format is dependent upon set top boxes and middleware that a viewer either purchases or leases from a broadcaster such as a cable operator. While these devices may have a variety of functional features they may require an additional expenditure that a viewer or a Multiple Systems Operator MSO may not want to incur especially if the viewer already has an Internet enabled device such as a home computer. This makes most existing interactive television programming heavy in the sense that specialized hardware is needed to take advantage of the interactive content embedded in an interactive programming signal. Additionally the combination of a required set top box and specialized interactive television formats make interactive programming distributed over an interactive television network difficult to integrate with conventional Web content such as Web pages available from a Web site.

Therefore a need exists for a light weight interactive programming system allowing for rich viewer participation which is easily integrated with existing Web content. The present invention meets such need.

In one aspect of the invention an interactive program includes moderator content generated by the moderator and edited participant commentary that is served by a moderator server. Moderators create and manage interactive programs using a Web site. Viewers register to be participants in interactive programs using the Web site as well. The interactive programs can be distributed as electronic documents written in a markup language such as HTML or XML over the Internet. The interactive programs can also be converted to conventional interactive television content for distribution over an interactive television network. The interactive programs can also be distributed over a Virtual Private Network VPN for use as a secure collaboration tool by an enterprise such as a business concern. The interactive programs require few processing resources so the interactive programs can be embedded within other Web processes such as electronic commerce eCommerce or television commerce t Commerce transactions.

In another aspect of the invention a method is provided for creating and transmitting an interactive program over a communications network. A moderator server is operably coupled to the communications network. A moderator client and a plurality of viewer clients are operably coupled to the moderator server via the communications network. In operation participant comment signals are received by the moderator server via the communications network from the plurality of viewer clients and transmitted by the moderator server via the communications network to the moderator client. The moderator server then receives from the moderator client edited participant comment signals and moderator signals and generates interactive program signals using the edited participant comment signals and the moderator signals. The interactive program signals are then transmitted by the moderator server via the communications network to the plurality of viewer clients.

In another aspect of the invention a data processing system is adapted for creating and transmitting an interactive program to a plurality of viewer clients as described above. In addition the data processing system receives content signals from a content server and generates the interactive program signals using the content signals edited participant comment signals and the moderator signals.

In another aspect of the invention the data processing system receives content signals from a content server and transmits the content signals via the communications network to the viewer clients while incorporating the content signals into the interactive program.

In another aspect of the invention the communications network is a virtual private network thus enabling private and secure transmission of an interactive program throughout an enterprise.

In another aspect of the invention the participant comment signals further include an interactive program rating signal indicating a level of audience satisfaction with the interactive program.

In another aspect of the invention the moderator signals further include a participant exclusion signal corresponding to a specific viewer client from the plurality of viewer clients. The participant exclusion signal is used to exclude participant comments received from the specific viewer client thus preventing specified viewers from participating in the interactive program.

The moderator controls the content of the interactive program in a variety of ways. The moderator introduces the initial topic or content for audience interaction. For example the moderator may introduce a topical event such as a news story and then ask for participant comments. The moderator may also use previously prepared content such as a non interactive program that is transmitted to the audience in order to elicit audience member responses and engage viewers. The moderator can invite virtual guests from the audience onto the virtual stage. While on the virtual stage the virtual guests exchange interactive messages directly with the moderator rather than with other audience members or participants. The moderator may also exclude a participant or viewer from the audience. Additionally the moderator may generate additional interactive programming for use by the audience such as polls so that the audience can participate in the interactive program by selecting responses to a question from a list of answers. The results of the participant responses are aggregated for inclusion in the interactive program.

In one system for creating an interactive program incorporating participant interactions in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the interactive programs are talk shows hosted by independent moderators and delivered to an audience via the Internet. This system allows a moderator to be recognized as an expert or respected voice in a particular field while building a community of viewer participants interested in that particular field. The system allows the moderator to create a controlled and moderated environment where the moderator directs the flow of information and has complete control over the medium. The system is cost effective because no special hardware or training is needed to operate the system. The system features a customizable Web based interface for moderators and viewers to use in creating customized collaborative interactive programs.

In a system for creating an interactive program incorporating viewer interactions in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the moderator server is operably coupled to content server via a communications link . The content server hosts a content source including content suitable for broadcast by the moderator server. Such content may include past broadcast programs that the moderator is using as a topic for further discussion within the audience. The moderator instructs the moderator server to request and receive content signals from the content server and the moderator server generates an interactive program including the content signals. In this way non interactive content may be enhanced with an interactive component thus leveraging non interactive content by creating an interactive program using content without an interactive component. In another embodiment of enhanced content the content is synchronized with the interactive component and the content is transmitted to the viewer client from a server other than the moderator server in program synchronous fashion.

In a system for creating an interactive program incorporating viewer interactions in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the moderator server hosts software facilities for the moderator to use in generating an interactive program. The moderator server is operably coupled to a moderator database including moderator information describing the type of interactive program the moderator produces and the moderator s interactive program broadcast schedule. The moderator information may be used to automatically generate a dynamic programming guide thus helping viewers find the moderator s interactive program. In addition the moderator server records viewer interaction data describing the amount timing and type of viewer interactions with the moderator s produced interactive programming. The moderator may access the viewer interaction data to generate reports regarding the moderator s interactive programming.

In a system for creating an interactive program incorporating viewer interactions in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the moderator server hosts a viewer database including viewer profile information. Viewer profile information includes information about viewer preferences and viewer notification requests. The viewer preferences are used by the moderator server to suggest interactive programming generated by a moderator which may match the viewer s stated preferences. The viewer notification requests are used by the moderator server to generate viewer notifications that are transmitted to a viewer in order to notify a viewer when a specific interactive program is about to be broadcast.

In one embodiment of a viewer notification generation process in accordance with the present invention the privacy of the viewer is protected by not allowing the moderator access to viewer profiles. For example the moderator may initiate a notification process but the moderator is never allowed to see to which viewers the notifications are sent. In addition any viewership reports generated on behalf of a moderator use aggregate data for the viewers so that the viewers identifications are not associated with the individual viewership reports.

In a system for creating an interactive program incorporating viewer interactions in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the audience and moderator comment on a broadcast program over which the moderator has minimal control. In this embodiment a broadcaster transmits a broadcast media signal received by a viewer s broadcast media receiver and a moderator s broadcast media receiver . In this embodiment the moderator and the audience watch the broadcast program and exchange commentary about the broadcast program over the communications network as described above. In this way non interactive programming can be supplemented with an interactive component. Exemplary broadcast programs include broadcasts of real time events such as sporting events or breaking news stories and pre recorded programming such entertainment programs or documentaries.

In one embodiment of a system for creating an interactive program in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the interactive programming generated by the moderator server is stored in a moderator database for archival purposes. The interactive programming can be indexed and cataloged for generation of an archive listing describing the archived interactive programming. A viewer can then request archived interactive programming for viewing at a later time for on demand viewing.

In one embodiment of a system for creating an interactive program in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention a viewer can initiate the creation of an archive for an interactive program. As the interactive program is produced and transmitted to the viewer the interactive program signals are stored for the viewer s own use. For example a viewer can initiate the creation of an archive for a short period of time so that the viewer can leave the interactive program and rejoin the interactive program and be able to view the portions of the interactive program that the viewer missed. As another example the viewer can create a personal archive of past interactive programs in a manner similar to a personal video recorder.

In another system for creating an interactive program in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the communications network is the Internet and the viewer clients and moderator client are Web browsers. The moderator server receives moderator and participant comment signals in the form of POST requests and generates the interactive program as an interactive electronic document written in a document markup language such as Hyper Text Markup Language HTML or eXtensible Markup Language XML that is transmitted to the viewer clients. The viewer clients parse the electronic document and generate viewer displays using the instructions in the electronic document. The viewers respond to the viewer displays by entering text and selecting elements from the viewer displays. These viewer interactions are transmitted to the moderator server by the viewer s clients in subsequent POST messages. The moderator receives a different set of interactive moderator electronic documents that implement a moderator user interface enabling the moderator to control the operations of the moderator server.

In one system for creating an interactive program in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the system is deployed using the Microsoft TV platform which is a standards based client and server software middleware system for deploying interactive programming. The platform includes a client software application hosted by a set top box and a server software application operably coupled by a communications network. The client software application includes a Web browser that can be used much like a conventional Web browser and an application programming interface for building native applications that are hosted by the set top box. The server includes several management functions including t commerce and client management applications.

In another system for creating an interactive program in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the interactive programming generated by the moderator server further includes click through style banner ads for selection by a viewer. If a viewer selects a click through banner ad the viewer s interaction with the banner ad is recorded in a moderator database in order to generate click through activity related to the interactive programming. The banner ads may come either from the moderator server or an ad server not affiliated with the moderator server.

In another interactive program creation system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a viewer downloads and installs a custom client plug in that allows a viewer a built in microphone on the viewer client. Using a control panel participants direct their questions or comments to either the virtual stage or the audience interactive message area. The spoken words are digitized by the viewer client analyzed translated into text form and transmitted via the communications link to the moderator server. The question or comment then appears in the interactive program. The plug in allows viewers to participate in an interactive program in a traditional voice based way if they choose to.

In another interactive program creation system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the spoken words are not translated to text. Instead the digitized voice is transmitted directly over the communications link to the moderator server such as in Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP transmissions.

In another telephony process as used by a telephony system for delivery of an interactive program in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the video components of the interactive program are dispensed with and the participant interacts with the textual components of the interactive program using the telephone device. In this way an interactive program can be created by a moderator with only textual or audio and textual components that is accessible to a participant using only a telephone device.

The interactive program generator receives the moderator content and the audience content and uses the content to generate enhanced interactive programming. The interactive programming includes viewer interactive programming and that is transmitted to the viewer clients for display and use of the viewers. The interactive programming further includes moderator interactive programming transmitted to the moderator for viewing and use by the moderator. The cycle of receiving participant moderator and edited participant comments and using the comments to generate interactive programming for transmission to the moderator and viewer is repeated indefinitely to create a continuous interactive program.

In an interactive program creation system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention content from a previously described content server is received by the interactive program generator and the content is included in the generated interactive programming. In an interactive program creation system in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention a virtual guest client transmits virtual guest comments to the virtual stage content engine for inclusion in the virtual stage content generated by the virtual content engine.

In an interactive program creation system in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the present invention the moderator participant and guest interactive messages are chat messages and the virtual stage and audience content engines are chat engines. The text based output from the chat engines is used by the interactive program generator generate interactive programming including electronic documents such as transcripts composed in a document markup language such as HTML or XML.

In one embodiment of a moderator server in accordance with the present invention the moderator server is operated in an application service provider ASP mode. In this mode the moderator server is used to create a private label interactive program creation system. In this mode the moderator server provides services that an operator can embed into another system such that a viewer perceives the interactive program creation system as being owned by individual operators. In some instances an indica of source such as a powered by notice is included in the interactive program creation system.

The moderator s interface is broken up into several operational sections. A stage interaction section displays the moderator s direct interaction with a virtual guest on a virtual stage. The stage interaction section includes a plurality of fields for display of virtual guests previous questions as exemplified by previous question field . For each answered virtual guest question a moderator response field as exemplified by moderator response field displays the moderator s response to the virtual guest s previous question. The stage interaction section further includes a current question field for display of a virtual guest s current question. A moderator uses a moderator text entry section to enter responses to the current virtual guest question.

An audience interaction section displays audience comments. The audience interaction comments are comments made by participants to other participants in the audience.

A moderator uses a status section to monitor the progress of the interactive program. The moderator invites audience members to the virtual stage to be virtual guests using an invite to stage selector . The moderator can select a viewer to invite on to the virtual stage by using a pull down menu of viewer names and selecting a viewer to invite. Once a viewer is invited to the virtual stage the viewer s interactive messages are displayed in the stage interaction section and not in the audience interaction section. The moderator can also exclude a participant by selecting a participant from a kick user out pull down menu . Once excluded the moderator server removes the excluded participant s comment signals from the plurality of participant comment signals edited by the moderator and used by the moderator server to generate the interactive program. In this way the moderator exercises direct control over the participants participating in the interactive program.

In another interactive program creation system the participant s exchange video clips and files directly with each other in a peer to peer relationship. In this mode the moderator server is not directly involved in the message exchanges occurring between audience members interacting with each other.

The status section further includes an audience approval system indicator for indicating to the moderator how the audience feels about the progress of the show. Viewer responses are aggregated in a to be described process and displayed to the moderator as a colored indicator and as a numerical value. A moderator uses the audience member counter field and pull down menu to determine the number and identification of the viewers receiving the transmitted interactive program. The status section further includes an elapsed time field for display of the elapsed time of the interactive program.

An audience question section displays an audience question that the moderator may answer by selecting an answer question button or delete by selecting a delete question button . The moderator can get a new audience question by selecting the update button .

A polls section includes a poll question display field for display of a current poll question and a poll results display field for display of viewer s responses to the poll. The moderator selects a new poll button to enter a new poll question whenever the moderator feels that a new poll should be created.

If no excluded words are found in the participant question the filter process determines the relevance of the participant question by matching the moderator s keywords to the words in the participant question. If it is determined that the relevance of the participant question exceeds the threshold relevance value then the participant question is added to a participant question queue .

In an embodiment of a filtering process in accordance with the present invention keywords and excluded words are matched to the participant question using approximate string matching techniques in order to determine the relevance value of a participant question including misspelled keywords or excluded words.

A poll section displays a poll question asked by the moderator of the viewers. The poll section includes a plurality of response buttons exemplified by response buttons and selectable by the viewer to indicate the viewer s response to the poll. The viewer selects an answer to the poll question by selecting one of the response buttons and then selects the Vote button to register the viewer s poll answer with the moderator server. The viewer interface further includes sections for banner advertising and for placement of a trademark or service mark to identify the operator of the moderator server. By allowing banner adds the moderator server allows a moderator to collect revenue from t commerce interactions with the moderator s hosted interactive program.

In another embodiment of an interactive program creation system in accordance with the present invention a poll is created using a plurality of participant questions for selection by participants. The participant question from the plurality of participant questions receiving the most participant selections is selected for submission to the moderator.

Referring again to a current audience approval system rating field is provided for the display of viewer s rating of an interactive program. Referring now to a diagram depicting a process for receiving viewer reactions to the interactive program and calculating an audience approval system rating for an interactive program in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown. A moderator generates an interactive program and transmits the interactive program to an audience as previously described. The audience includes a plurality of viewers as exemplified by viewers and . Each viewer may have a different opinion of the quality of the interactive program therefore each viewer is provided with an individual audience approval system button as exemplified by audience approval system buttons and . Each viewer selects an audience approval system rating button corresponding to the viewer s subjective rating of the interactive program. The selection of an audience approval system button transmits a corresponding audience approval system signal to the moderator server not shown thus creating a plurality of audience approval system signals for evaluation by the moderator server. The moderator server receives the plurality of audience approval system signals and uses them to generate a single audience approval system rating signal and transmits the audience approval system rating signal for display on the moderator s interface not shown .

In an audience approval system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention an audience approval system signal can take on three states and with each state representing a viewer s subjective opinion of the interactive program. In this embodiment the three states are mapped to the corresponding numeric values of 100 50 and 0 with 100 representing a viewer s complete satisfaction with the interactive program 50 representing the viewer s partial satisfaction with the interactive program and 0 representing the viewer s complete dissatisfaction with the interactive program. Each of the plurality of audience approval system signals are mapped to one of these numeric values. These numeric values are used to generate an arithmetic mean representing the audience approval system rating of the interactive program. In the illustrated example of viewer rates the interactive program at 100 viewer rates the interactive program at 50 and viewer rates the interactive program at 100 . These values are used by the moderator server to generate an arithmetic mean of the plurality of mapped viewer s audience approval system signals. The arithmetic mean is presented to the moderator as the audience approval system rating of the moderator s interactive program. In one audience approval system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the audience approval system rating is mapped to a color with the numeric value of 100 being represented in green the numeric value of 50 being represented in yellow and the numeric value of 0 being represented in red.

The moderator also accesses the interactive program creation system to host an interactive program. While the moderator is hosting an interactive program the system provides facilities for audience management allowing the moderator to restrict access to an interactive program. As previously described the system provides facilities for the moderator to block interactive messages from viewers in the audience. The system also provides a facility for posting polls during the interactive program. This allows a moderator to pose questions to the audience in order to receive and aggregate viewer s opinions about various subjects during an interactive program as previously described. The system further includes facilities for answering questions presented by viewers to the moderator. As previously described a moderator can receive questions from viewers and determine whether or not to answer them. Additionally the system provides an invitation facility for inviting viewers to participate in the interactive program as a virtual guest as previously described.

The moderator may also access the interactive program creation system to perform administrative tasks associated with moderating a periodically presented interactive program. The interactive program creation system provides facilities for sending scheduling reminders to viewers about upcoming interactive programs. Such scheduling reminders may be transmitted to a viewer by email to a viewer s personal pager to a viewer s wireless phone or to a viewer s personal digital assistant.
