An electrical network such as a power grid may provide electrical power for numerous users. The electrical network may comprise one or more feeder lines. For example a first feeder line may supply electrical power to a first set of users while a second feeder line may supply electrical power to a second set of users. The first feeder line and the second feeder line may be interconnected by a breaker switch that may be opened to isolate the two feeder lines or may be closed to connect the two feeder lines. Fault detection fault isolation and load restoration FDIR functionally may be used to automate switching and or routing within the electrical network such as between the first feeder line and the second feeder line. For example upon detecting a fault along the first feeder line the FDIR may isolate the fault by opening local breaker switches around the fault and may close the breaker switch between the feeder lines so that the second feeder may provide electrical power to the non isolated portion of the first feeder line. Voltage var control VVC functionality may be used to improve quality of a feeder line. For example the VVC may mitigate phase shifts associated with voltage and or current e.g. phase shifts introduced by loads such as motors by utilizing capacitor banks to control voltage along the feeder line. Because changes made to the electrical network by the FDIR may be unknown to the VVC and changes along a feeder line by the VVC may be unknown to the FDIR the VCC and or the FDIR may make suboptimal decisions by using stale information regarding the electrical network.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Among other things one or more systems and or techniques for synchronizing a fault detection fault isolation and load restoration FDIR component and a voltage var control VVC component are provided herein. That is an electrical network may comprise various devices such as capacitor banks measurement devices load tap changers breaker switches substations transformers and or other devices. The FDIR component and or the VVC component may provide functionality for the electrical network such as for a feeder line based upon a state of the electrical network e.g. load information voltage information current information breaker switch statuses electrical network faults available capacitor banks etc. . Because the FDIR component may be unaware of changes made to the state of the electrical network by the VVC component e.g. a change in voltage and or the VVC component may be unaware of changes made to the state of the electrical network by the FDIR component e.g. isolation of a fault and or connection of two feeder lines by closing a breaker switch the FDIR component and or the VVC component may make suboptimal decisions due to a lack of current information about the electrical network. Accordingly as provided herein an electrical network model describing device connections within the electrical network may be maintained e.g. stored within a database of a substation control center and or synchronized between the FDIR component and the VVC component. In this way the FDIR component and or the VVC component may execute functionality utilizing relatively up to date information about the electrical network within the electrical network model.

The electrical network model may comprise a variety of information about the electrical network such as status of capacitor banks current flow measurements load tap changer information status of breaker switches a circuit topology of the electrical network and or other information e.g. information that may be used by functionality of the FDIR component the VVC component and or other components . In one example of maintaining the electrical network model one of more field devices within the electrical network may be queried for network information e.g. a field device may report a list of devices with which the field device is connected and or measurement data known to the field device .

In another example of maintaining the electrical network model a network change to the electrical network by the FDIR component may be identified e.g. the FDIR component may open or close a breaker switch based upon a fault isolation operation and or a fault restoration operation . Accordingly the electrical network model may be updated based upon the network change to create an updated electrical network model. The VVC component and or other components may be notified of the updated electrical network model e.g. the updated electrical network model may comprise an indication that a new capacitor bank is available to a feeder line or that a capacitor bank is no longer available to a feeder line . For example the VVC component may be invoked to perform a power factor correction operation a voltage correction operation and or a phase correction operation based upon the updated electrical network model.

In another example of maintaining the electrical network model a network change to the electrical network by the VVC component may be identified e.g. the VVC component may change a status of a capacitor bank which may change a capacitance within the electrical network . Accordingly the electrical network model may be updated based upon the network change to create an updated electrical network model. The FDIR component and or other components may be notified of the updated electrical network model e.g. the updated electrical network model may comprise an indication of a change in status of a capacitor bank associated with a feeder line . For example the FDIR component may be invoked to perform a load evaluation operation based upon the updated electrical network model.

In this way the FDIR component may be synchronized with the electrical network model so that FDIR functionality may take into consideration relatively up to date information associated with the electrical network model e.g. changes made by the VVC component . Similarly the VVC component may be synchronized with the electrical network model so that VVC functionality may take into consideration relatively up to date information associated with the electrical network model e.g. changes made by the FDIR component .

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

Many electrical networks such as power grids may utilize a fault detection fault isolation and load restoration FDIR component and or a voltage var control VVC component. The FDIR component may be configured to automate switching and routing within the electrical network. For example the FDIR component may detect a fault isolate the fault e.g. open one or more breaker switches around a faulty area to isolate a healthy portion of the electrical network from the faulty area and may restore electrical power to the healthy portion e.g. a breaker switch connecting a different feeder line to the healthy portion may be closed so that the feeder line may supply electrical power to the healthy portion . In this way reliability and power outage response may be improved for the electrical network by the FDIR component. The VVC component may be configured to maintain desired voltage along a feeder line e.g. a voltage of 110V with a 5 10 deviation allowance and or mitigate voltage or current phase shifts introduced by loads such as motors. Currently an FDIR component and VVC component may have relatively low awareness of one another such that a change made to the electrical network by one component may not be known to the other component which may result in suboptimal decision making by the components.

Accordingly as provided herein the FDIR component the VVC component and or other components of the electrical network may be synchronized through an electrical network model that describes the electrical network e.g. device connections electrical measurements switch statuses capacitor bank statuses a circuit topology etc. . In this way the FDIR component and the VVC component may be aware of changes made to the electrical network by one another so that FDIR functionality and or VVC functionality may take into account relatively up to date and accurate electrical network information during decision making processing.

The updated electrical network model may be made available to various components such as the VVC component.
