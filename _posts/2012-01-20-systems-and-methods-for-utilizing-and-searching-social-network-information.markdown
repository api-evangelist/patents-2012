title: Systems and methods for utilizing and searching social network information
abstract: Methods and systems for indexing, storing, recalling and displaying social network user profiles, event calendar postings and user feed postings are described. A single, discrete set of keywords, can be utilized and assigned to both user profiles and postings and can operate as a method of indexing. The assignment of these keywords may allow users to control the display of calendar and feed content by matching assigned posting keywords to assigned profile keywords via a matching algorithm. Matched event-related postings may also be automatically displayed in a user's calendar. Searches of profiles and postings may also be performed by constructing queries using the same set of discrete keywords attached to profiles and postings. Users may have the ability to control the display of specific profile information and postings via privacy settings, which utilize unique methods of tracking relationship segmentation and social distance.

Conventionally users of social networking websites connect with other users by posting information about themselves to the network for access by other users. For example a user may post interests events needs requests status updates contact information and so forth. Users may contact each other and or review information about each other through a mutually accepted bidirectional social connection or in some cases a unidirectional connection based on privacy settings configured by a user.

Large social networking websites have developed systems for tailoring connections between various users including event calendars posting feeds a.k.a. news feeds and search functionality. However in many cases it is difficult for users who do not share a direct relationship with one another to connect or view accurate information and postings concerning mutual interests or needs. This is primarily related to the way social networks allow users to store and access user profile and posting data. There is a need for improved systems and methods of indexing storing recalling and displaying data relating to user profiles and postings and improved systems and methods to allow users to easily and accurately search or receive information concerning mutual interests or needs.

The invention provides systems and methods for utilizing and searching social network information. Various aspects of the invention described herein may be applied to any of the particular applications set forth below. The invention may be applied as a standalone system or as a component of an integrated software solution searching information or as a component of a social networking site. The invention can be optionally integrated into existing business and social networking processes seamlessly. It shall be understood that different aspects of the invention can be appreciated individually collectively or in combination with each other.

In one embodiment of the invention a method of displaying social network information is provided. The method includes steps of creating a central keyword database having a plurality of pre defined keywords organized into categories and tagging a user profile of a user with at least one keyword from the central keyword database for associating users with keyword descriptors. In addition the method includes tagging at least one posting with at least one keyword from the central keyword database for associating the posting with keyword descriptors and applying an automatic matching algorithm to find postings that match the user profile and allow those postings to display in an event calendar news feed or in search results. The matching algorithm may match keywords associated with the posting and keywords associated with the user and whether the posting is displayed in a user s event calendar news feed or within search results may depend on privacy settings for a particular user s profile.

In one embodiment a method of displaying social network information customized to interests of a user comprises creating a central keyword database having a plurality of pre defined keywords organized into categories tagging a user profile of the user with at least one keyword from the central keyword database for associating users with profile keyword descriptors tagging an posting within a social network with at least one keyword from the central keyword database for associating postings with posting keyword descriptors applying a plurality of matching criteria to the user profile and the posting wherein the plurality of matching criteria comprises privacy settings of user profiles and privacy settings of postings and displaying to an event calendar or news feed of the user the posting if matched by the plurality of matching criteria to the user profile of the user wherein the matching criteria provides the user with postings customized to interests of the user.

The invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described.

The present invention relates generally to the indexing storage recall and presentation of information in a social network and more particularly to systems and methods for indexing storage and presentation of user profiles postings and scheduled events. As described herein a posting may be related to an event general message jobs service providers dates support groups student needs etc. and may contain any type of content as desired by the user or maintained by the system. A posting may be created by a user or imported by the system from outside the system a.k.a. system generated posts. System generated posts may be generated from information obtained from third party sources or other social networks. For example system generated posts may be generated from information from a website which sells event tickets a website which hosts sporting events or a group buying website.

A system and method for indexing storing recalling and displaying social network user profiles and postings is provided. A social network can have a central keyword database which organizes a finite set of keywords into various categories which are then used to index user profiles and postings some of which can be event postings. Postings may also be message postings job postings request postings question postings statement postings news postings etc. These categories may have unique classifications which affect calendar matching feed matching and search algorithms. A user of a social network here referred to as the viewing user can describe themselves in multiple ways through the selection of specific keywords which come from the central keyword database. Such keywords are referred to herein as profile keyword tags. A viewing user may select such profile keyword tags from a keyword database which describes himself herself upon first signing up for an account or at any time while using the system. Users here referred to as posting users may also post items into the social network e.g. event postings job postings request postings question postings statement postings news postings etc . These postings which are submitted by posting users or are system generated can be tagged by selecting keywords from the same central keyword database. These tags are referred to herein as posting keyword tags. 

Viewing users can configure a smart calendar engine so their calendar may be automatically populated with event related postings using a matching algorithm that among other things takes into account event related posting keyword tags which match the viewing user s profile keyword tags. Viewing users can also configure a smart feed engine so their news feed automatically populates with postings using a matching algorithm that among other things takes into account posting keyword tags which match the profile keyword tags of the viewing user. Posting users can also configure a syndication engine which will push the user s posting into other distribution channels such as email text message Facebook Twitter and various instant message clients. Viewing users can perform accurate searches of postings and profiles by constructing search queries in a search engine using keywords from the central keyword database. Users can maintain privacy by segmenting their relationships and controlling the viewing of posts and profile information by both relationship segmentation and social distance. Users beyond one degree from each other can see the path of relationship by viewing a relationship map. In addition privacy settings may be based on certain characteristics or profile keyword tags of a user. Thus a user may control and maintain privacy by limiting their postings or certain aspects of their profiles to be viewable only by users that match certain characteristics or keyword tags. These functions are all described in more detail below.

Any user in the social network may use the news feed calendar and search functionality of the social network and become the viewing user or become the posting user as the poster of items within the social network. In some embodiments the viewing user and the posting user may be the same users for example for purposes of reviewing a personal posting.

The social network provider may include functions and capabilities such as a smart calendar engine smart feed engine search engine syndication engine storage module interface module each further described below or other functionality. The social network information system or social network provider may be coupled to a server and database which can store the social network information and run the various engines.

As shown in a smart feed engine is coupled to the social network provider . The smart feed engine utilizes profile keyword tags selected for a particular user e.g. the viewing user to control the items displayed within the news feed or smart feed of a user such as the viewing user using an algorithmic matching system that among other things evaluates different classifications of keywords within postings. Examples of a viewing user may include a user an association of users members of an event students in a class members of a club and the like. According to some embodiments the viewing user may be coupled directly via the user device to the smart feed engine . According to other embodiments the smart feed engine comprises a module associated with the social network provider .

A smart calendar engine is coupled to the soial network provider . The smart calendar engine utilizes profile keyword tags selected for a particular user e.g. the viewing user to control event related items displayed within the calendar of a user such as the viewing user using an algorithmic matching system that among other things evaluates different classifications of keywords within event postings. According to some embodiments the viewing user may be coupled directly via the user device to the smart calendar engine . According to other embodiments the smart calendar engine comprises a module associated with the social network provider .

A syndication engine is coupled to the social network provider . The syndication engine pushes postings for a particular user e.g. the posting user into distribution channels such as email and text message as well as social network accounts belonging to posting user such as Facebook Twitter or various instant message clients. Examples of a posting user may include a user an association of users members of an event students in a class members of a club and the like. According to some embodiments the posting user may be coupled directly via the user device to the syndication engine . According to other embodiments the syndication engine comprises a module associated with the social network provider .

A search engine is coupled to the social network provider . The search engine utilizes keywords selected from the central keyword database by a particular user e.g. the viewing user to form a search query to search for users profiles posting users postings and system generated postings using an algorithmic matching system that among other things evaluates different classifications of keywords within profiles and postings. According to some embodiments the viewing user may be coupled directly via the user device to the search engine . According to other embodiments the search engine comprises a module associated with the social network provider .

Referring now to a block diagram of storage and interface modules of an exemplary social network provider such as the social network provider shown in is shown. Storage may include a profile database for storing data associated with each of the users such as the user associated with user device . When a user subscribes to services provided by the social network provider a user profile may be generated for user . For example the user may select descriptive keywords to be the user s profile keywords from the central keyword database privacy settings provide links to social networks they belong to provide work information provide contact information or group other users according to one or more categories. When the user adds additional information to the user s profile such as adding additional contacts the user s profile in the profile database may be updated with the information added. The user s profile may be stored modified added and so forth to any storage medium. Fewer or more components may comprise the social network provider or components of storage and interface and still fall within the scope of the various embodiments.

According to some embodiments certain components of the user s profile may be created outside of the social network environment and provided to or accessed by the social network provider . Alternatively the profile database may be located remotely and accessed by the social network provider .

The social network provider may also include an interface which may have a display engine GUI and a communications interface for communicating with users such as via the user device described herein over the network . The user device communicates various types of information such as keyword selections privacy setting selections groupings of other users and so forth to the interface via the communications interface . Any type of communications interface is within the scope of various embodiments.

A central keyword database provides users method of tagging profiles and postings including event postings with an identical finite set of keywords which are organized into categories. For example the keyword painter can be associated with a service provider an artist or a job posting depending on the context of the user s actions. By organizing the same keyword under different categories within the central keyword database users can accurately tag their profiles and postings to ensure relevant searching or viewing by viewing users . It should also be noted that system generated postings can be similarly tagged with keywords from the central keyword database to ensure relevant searching or viewing by viewing users . Furthermore different categories may have different classifications which affect matching algorithms used by the smart calendar engine smart feed engine and search engine .

A viewing user may select a series of profile keywords for their profile which describe activity interests and a posting user may subsequently select a series of posting keywords to describe an activity some of which may match the viewing user s profile keywords. For example a viewing user may select the keyword Triathlete which describes his or her activity interests. The viewing user will therefore have Triathlete stored as one of his profile keywords. A different posting user may subsequently post or schedule an event for a triathlon practice for example giving a specific date and time for the event and attaching the keyword Triathlete to the posting. Because the viewing user s profile keyword matches the posting keywords the viewing user may see the event posting via the smart calendar engine or smart feed engine. A viewing user may also see the event via the search engine . The posting user may be able to set certain privacy settings such that even if some keywords selected for the posting by the posting user from the central keyword database are identical and stored under identical categories a viewing user may not be able to view the posting because the matching algorithm recognized the posting was not appropriate. For example the posting user may limit the event to be viewable or searchable by users who are designated as his friends or within a certain location or a certain social distance or by assigning certain posting keywords which in turn exclude a viewing user even though one of the posting keywords may match the viewing user s profile keywords etc.

A relationship database may be provided for storing relationship data about each user . In various embodiments the viewing user can specify relationships with one or more users of the social network via the user profile or by any other means. The viewing user can segment relationships by assigning categories groups lists networks and so forth to one or more users with which the viewing user has a relationship. The relationship for example may specify that the user is a business relationship family relationship and so forth. Any type of relationship may be specified. The relationship database may also provide a means for a viewing user to track a path of social connections between the viewing user and other users which have a relationship distance greater than one degree from the viewing user

A display engine GUI may also be provided by the interface . The display engine GUI displays one or more items posting information profile information and so forth to users . Users can interact with the social network provider via the display engine GUI . For example users can select keywords from the central keyword database select privacy settings access their own user profile access other users information available via the social network provider and so forth via the display engine GUI . The smart calendar smart feed and search engine results may be displayed in fields within the display engine GUI .

A posting database is provided for storing data associated with a posting user s postings and system generated postings into storage and linking such data to the posting user s profile in the profile database . When a posting user elects to publish an item with posting keyword tags for viewing by viewing users in the calendar or news feed of the social network provider a posting may be generated and stored in the posting database . For example the posting user may post an event job posting question request for service provider request for a date and so forth select descriptive keywords to tag the posting from the central keyword database provide additional relevant information concerning the posting select privacy settings including limits on social distance and relationship segmentation and provide contact information for at least one other viewing user to see. When the posting user adds information to or modifies information in the posting such as location information the posting database may be updated with the information added. Postings may be stored modified added and so forth to any storage medium.

Although the social network provider is described as being comprised of various components including a smart calendar engine a search engine smart feed engine syndication engine and storage and interface components which may include a profile database a communications interface a central keyword database a relationship database a display engine GUI and a posting database fewer or more components may comprise the social network provider and still fall within the scope of various embodiments.

For example in the viewing user Matt may tag his profile in multiple ways by selecting keywords from a central keyword database to be associated with his user profile . Such profile keywords may reflect Matt s interests activities characteristics or other aspects related to or about Matt viewing user . For example Matt may indicate his interests in Poker Opera Surfing Hang Gliding or Poetry by selecting such keywords from the central keyword database to be included in his profile keywords . Matt may also indicate that he is of Brazilian descent. In other instances the same profile keyword Brazilian may indicate that Matt is interested in Brazilian food or Brazilian culture depending on the category of the keyword. Matt may also indicate that he is a student at Stanford by selecting the profile keyword Student Stanford U or that he is enrolled in or has previously taken the Finance class. Further information on Finance may be available in a description including information about the class the class type or that the class is taught by Professor Jones . It can be appreciated that numerous other profile keywords can be chosen from the central keyword database by Matt including but not limited to Graphic Design C Software Engineer or Single .

The posting user Erika may post to a social network certain event postings job postings request postings question postings statement postings news postings etc. In an example of an event posting We are playing 5 card stud tonight is shown. Erika may set certain privacy settings for the posting. For example Erika may limit the posting to be viewed by only Erika s friends or only friends of friends i.e. 2 degree friends or only those who are students at Stanford etc. Erika s posting may be assigned keywords from the central keyword database to the posting. Such keywords assigned to the posting are posting keywords. A matching algorithm may then match the profile keywords of viewing users to posting keywords of postings. In one embodiment when a posting is matched to a viewing user the viewing user may view the posting in his or her smart feed . In this example because Matt s profile keyword Poker matches Erika s posting keyword Matt is notified of Erika s posting via his smart feed .

It should be noted that a user may not need to manually select profile keywords from the central keyword database to tag their profile and that this process can be accomplished through automated means regardless of whether the keyword s are specifically mentioned in the profile. It should also be noted that a posting user may not need to manually select posting keywords from the central keyword database to tag their posting and that this process can be accomplished through automated means regardless of whether the keyword s are specifically mentioned in the posting. It should be further noted that a viewing user s smart feed is not the only place where a posting matched by the smart feed engine becomes displayed for the viewing user and the display may be inside or outside the social network environment may be displayed as a result of a search in the user s smart calendar or through other means not specifically described herein.

For example the posting user Erika may create an event posting . The title may be We are playing 5 card stud tonight. Erika may select posting keyword tag Poker from the central keyword database to be associated with the posting . Erika may select a date to be Mar. 23 2009 may select a time to be 9 30 pm and the location to be Trump Casino. Erika may set privacy settings such that only users with a social distance of two degrees or less may see the posting. Other options may include limiting the viewing to friends directly connected to Erika or to hide the posting from business contacts or to limit it to certain specific users or groups. As described above the matching algorithm may determine whether any viewing users match the posting taking into account profile keywords posting keywords and other privacy settings. In addition in cases where a posting has multiple keywords attached the matching algorithm may take into account certain groupings of these keywords as part of the matching process. For example in scenario A if a posting is tagged with a group of three keywords the matching algorithm may only match the posting to a viewing user if the viewing user has all three posting keywords as profile keywords . Alternatively in scenario B if a posting is tagged with a different group of three keywords the matching algorithm may match the posting to a viewing user if the viewing user has any one of the three posting keywords as profile keywords . In addition the matching algorithm could take into account any combination of scenarios A and B and with any number of posting keywords . The matching algorithm may take into account keyword groupings for the smart feed engine smart calendar engine and the search engine . In the case of the smart feed engine if the matching algorithm matches a posting to a viewing user then the viewing user may view the matching posting in his or her smart feed . It should be noted that the exemplary environment represents an event related posting and other types of postings may not require the same data input.

In another example the system may generate a posting from a third party website. For example a group buying website may post opportunities for discounts for a certain purchase which would only be available if enough people buy. The group buying website may additionally have this post posted as a system generated post within the system and matched to users with specific interests or specific profile keyword tags.

In the exemplary screen shot the smart feed display contains postings which contain data relevant to an event related posting or any other kind of posting which may be available such as a job posting news posting etc. In one embodiment the posting contains information such as social distance between the viewing user and posting user the number of common first degree relationships friends between the viewing user and posting user the ability search other postings by the posting user keyword posting tag s from the central keyword database selected by the posting user event date time and location information number of friends attending and the ability to view additional details or join the event .

In certain embodiments the posting modules can have advertisements posted along side each posting . These advertisements may be targeted by posting tag keywords attached to the posting.

The smart feed may contain a sorting function which allows a viewing user to sort the smart feed by date time posting user name social distance of the posting user the number of common first degree relationships friends chronological posting order geographic distance of event or other data points associated with the posting.

It should be noted that a user may not need to manually select keywords from the central keyword database to tag their profile and that this process can be accomplished through automated means regardless of whether the keyword s are specifically mentioned in the profile. For example certain keywords from the central keyword database may be assigned based on a user s information from other social networks an uploaded resume other keywords that the user has selected or that have been tagged to the user s profile etc. It should also be noted that a posting user may not need to manually select keywords from the central keyword database to tag their posting and that this process can be accomplished through automated means regardless of whether the keyword s are specifically mentioned in the posting. It should be further noted that a viewing user s smart calendar is not the only place where a posting matched by the smart calendar engine becomes displayed for the viewing user and the display may be inside or outside the social network environment. A smart calendar engine determines if posting should be matched to a viewing user s smart calendar based on a matching algorithm which among other things may take into account the privacy settings of the posting user the privacy settings of the viewing user the keywords with which the posting is tagged and how those keywords relate to the viewing user s keywords the degree relationship social distance between the viewing user and the posting user and or location of the user relative to location of the event posting or any combination or subset of the foregoing . It should be understood that any combination of the foregoing factors may be utilized by the matching algorithm. For example the matching algorithm may only take into account a user s degree relationship social distance with another user and may not factor in other variables such as keyword matching. Thus a viewing user may also choose to receive event postings posted by other users having a certain relationship with the viewing user e.g. a first degree relationship in their smart calendar regardless of keyword matching.

For example the posting user Erika may create an event posting . The title may be We are playing 5 card stud tonight. Erika may select posting keyword tag Poker from the central keyword database to be associated with the posting . Erika may select a date to be Mar. 23 2009 may select a time to be 9 30 pm and the location to be Trump Casino. Erika may set privacy settings such that only users with a social distance of two degrees or less may see the posting. Other options may include limiting the viewing to friends directly connected to Erika or to hide the posting from business contacts or to limit it to certain specific users or groups. As described above the matching algorithm may determine whether any viewing users match the posting taking into account profile keywords posting keywords and other privacy settings or any combination or subset of the foregoing . If the matching algorithm matches a posting to a viewing user then the viewing user may view the matching posting in his or her smart calendar through the smart calendar engine .

It should be noted that the exemplary environment represents an event related posting and other types of postings may not require the same data input.

It should be noted that the exemplary posting represents an event related posting and other types of postings may use the syndication engine.

For example viewing user Matt may construct a query by choosing keywords from the central keyword database Latin America and Volunteer tourism. Matt may then adjust certain filters such as geographic distance social distance time date etc. The query may be processed by the search engine to produce results which find postings which match the search query as shown in .

For example viewing user Matt may construct a query using keywords from the central keyword database Paraplegic and Hand cycling. Matt may then adjust certain filters such as geographic distance social distance time date etc. The query may then be processed by the search engine to produce results which find profiles which match the search query as shown in .

A user may select Customized settings or Advanced Options to adjust specific calendar matching criteria as described further below . A user may select Friends Activities in order to view all events their friends or social network connections have joined or formed provided their friends have privacy settings which permit those events to be viewed. A user may also view Suggested Activities to see all matched results. Various category filters also allow filtering by main categories e.g. Entertainment Sports Athletics Recreation Arts Culture Lifestyle etc. and allow a user to select sub categories e.g. Social Nightlife Music Movies Film Dancing Playing Cards Video Games Tabletop Games etc. within the category of Entertainment .

In the exemplary screen shot in the smart calendar display contains posting results which contain data relevant to an event related posting. In one embodiment the results contain information such as social distance between the viewing user and posting user the number of common first degree relationships friends between the viewing user and posting user the ability search other postings by the posting user keyword posting tag s from the central keyword database selected by the posting user event date time and location information number of friends attending and the ability to view additional details or join the event.

In certain embodiments a user may accumulate points based on the number of activities or events that a user joins or creates. The points may accumulate according to interest. For example a user may be able to accumulate volleyball points if the events are related to volleyball baseball card collecting points for events related to baseball collecting etc. Once the user achieves a certain number of points the user may receive some sort of indication for example a larger custom profile icon pertaining to that interest or an article of clothing which displays their favorite activity icon . A user may be able to access certain offers after achieving a certain point threshold as well. For instance a user may be able to receive virtual currency in return for passing certain point accumulation thresholds. This virtual currency may be used to purchase items on the social network or potentially on other social networks or systems such as game networks or even for the purchase of physical goods. The user may also be able to accumulate enough points to earn coupons or discounts for the purchase of goods or services from partner businesses which have formed agreements with the social network.

In certain embodiments the user may receive coupons or discounts for joining an activity or event which has been posted in the system by partner businesses which have formed agreements with the social network. These coupons or discounts could be used for the purchase of goods or services from partner businesses. In some cases users may receive coupons or discounts for joining activities and events from system generated postings or from businesses which have not specifically partnered with the social network.

In certain embodiments the posting results can have advertisements posted along side each result . These advertisements may be targeted by using posting tag keywords attached to the posting.

The smart calendar may contain a sorting function which allows a viewing user to sort the smart calendar by date time posting user name social distance of the posting user the number of common first degree relationships friends chronological posting order geographic distance of event only events the viewing user is attending or other data points associated with the posting.

Various other types of data may also be aggregated. For example a number may be generated by the total number of historical posts generated by the user a number may be generated by the total number of current activities not expired the user has created or joined selecting this button may produce filtered results of my posts with only current activities the user has created or joined a number may be generated by the total number of friend requests that the user has outstanding and a number may be generated by the total number of friend suggestions the user has outstanding .

A dashboard may also include a map that displays pins of calendar activities on a map at a location of a certain activity. A Friends Activities tab may display calendar results from a Smart Calendar for a user s friends activities. A user may also be able to be alerted if friends join an event for example if the user clicks on a posting a posting details page may be launched. Further a link to a Smart Calendar may be provided. A Suggested Activities tab may also be available to display a user s keyword matched activities from other users within a social distance of X degrees from the user or other suggestions from the system. When selected the map view may change to show activities suggested. Clicking on or mousing over a particular pinned location on a map may produce a pop up or bubble with information relating to the posting such as keywords matching date time or other information relating to the posting.

The wheel selection may also be organized into primary categories and subcategories. For example the left wheel may include various primary categories for activities such as Sports Entertainment Recreation Lifestyle as discussed above and the right wheel selection may be dynamically loaded with options based on subcategories within the primary categories. For example upon selecting Sports in the left wheel various sports options such as Basketball Tennis Soccer and Football may be loaded in the right wheel and made available for the user to select from.

As shown in the system may automatically generate an activity description from the posting user s wheel selections. For example if the user selects Go and Surfing the system may automatically generate a description of Going Surfing. Similarly the system may automatically generate a description of Attending Lecture from wheel selections of Attend and lecture or Getting Dinner from wheel selections of Get and Dinner or Seeing a band from wheel selections of See and Band. It can be appreciated that various types of activity descriptions may be automatically generated from the various wheel selection combinations that are possible. In addition the user may also be able to input other fields for the event posting such as a more detailed description location an event time and may invite other viewing users to participate in the event in .

Based on the wheel selections and other information that is provided by the posting user the system may automatically associate certain keyword tags from the central keyword database for the event posting. The system may be able to analyze various English words and phrases added to the posting description by posting user whereby the wheel selection acts as a filter to improve this analysis allowing for the mapping to focus on a more narrow range of possible choices to correctly generate certain keyword tags. In doing so the system may need to take into account tense plurality misspelling and other factors. Because the event posting may be associated with various posting keyword tags the event posting may be displayed for various viewing users in a smart feed as a result of a search in the user s smart calendar or through other means as discussed above.

In the system may automatically generate location selections from the posting user s wheel selections. For example if the user selects Get and Coffee the system may automatically generate several choices of nearby coffee shops for the posting user to choose from. In addition the user may also be able to use a search function to search for other locations within a database. Alternatively the user may be able to input a location name and address if the location is not available in the search results or automated options offered. The system may choose to present the automatically generated choices in a certain order for example by highlighting sponsored results on top or in some other manner.

As shown in if the user inputs an additional description into the input field the system may automatically suggest one or more interests or profile keyword tags to be mapped to the user s profile. The user may be given an option with buttons to be able to add the interest or profile keyword tag to the user s profile. Further the system may leverage the user s wheel selections to improve the interest or profile keyword tag suggestions.
