Therefore according to a second aspect the invention also provides novel compounds of formula I having good fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic harmful fungi 

The term compounds I refers to compounds of formula I. Likewise this terminology applies to all sub formulae e.g. compounds I.A refers to compounds of formula I.A or compounds V refers to compounds of formula V etc.

The compounds I can be by various routes in analogy to prior art processes known per se for preparing cf. Tetrahedron Lett. 49 1969 4273 4274 and advantageously by the synthesis shown in the following schemes and in the experimental part of this application.

In a first step for example cf. Synthetic Commun. 36 2006 3591 3597 Revue Roumaine de Chimie 50 2005 601 607 Chem. Ind. London 4 1991 130 JP 571200502 DD 218261 DD 224031 dichloromaleic anhydride II is reacted in a first step with an amine III if appropriate in the presence of a diluent to obtain maleic imides IV 

Thereafter for example cf. Tetrahedron Lett. 26 15 2689 1995 Tetrahedron Lett. 55 40 11859 1999 European Polym. J. 24 3 255 258 1988 the resulting maleic imides IV are then reacted with benzene 1 2 diols dithiols or diamines of formula V preferably in the presence of a base e.g. KOH NaOH or KCO and diluent to obtain compounds I 

If appropriate the resulting compounds I can subsequently be oxidized e.g. with nitric acid to form compounds I wherein X is S O. If individual compounds I cannot be obtained by the routes described above they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.

Those mixtures are of particular interest since many of them at the same application rate show higher efficiencies against harmful fungi. Furthermore combating harmful fungi with a mixture of compounds I and at least one fungicide from groups A to L as described above is more efficient than combating those fungi with individual compounds I or individual fungicides from groups A to L . By applying compounds I together with at least one active substance from groups A to O a synergistic effect can be obtained i.e. more then simple addition of the individual effects is obtained synergistic mixtures .

This can be obtained by applying the compounds I and at least one further active substance simultaneously either jointly e.g. as tank mix or separately or in succession wherein the time interval between the individual applications is selected to ensure that the active substance applied first still occurs at the site of action in a sufficient amount at the time of application of the further active substance s .

The mixtures of active substances can be prepared as compositions comprising besides the active ingredients at least one inert ingredient by usual means e.g. by the means given for the compositions of compounds I.

Concerning usual ingredients of such compositions reference is made to the explanations given for the compositions containing compounds I.

The mixtures of active substances according to the present invention are suitable as fungicides as are the compounds of formula I. They are distinguished by an outstanding effectiveness against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi especially from the classes of the Ascomycetes Basidiomycetes Deuteromycetes and Peronosporomycetes syn. Oomycetes . In addition it is referred to the explanations regarding the fungicidal activity of the compounds and the compositions containing compounds I respectively.

With due modification of the starting compounds the procedures shown in the synthesis examples below were used to obtain further compounds I. The resulting compounds together with physical data are listed in Table I below.

A stirred solution of 4 methylbenzene 1 2 dithiol 0.5 g in anhydrous DMF 50 ml was treated with KCOand 3 4 dichloro 1 methyl pyrrole 2 5 dione 0.73 g and stirred for about 7 hours at 80 C. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with MTBE. The combined organic phases were washed once with water and after removal of the solvent under reduced pressure the crude product 0.85 g was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel cyclohexane ethyl acetate 9 1 to yield the compound ex. I 2 0.25 g m.p. 171 176 C.

The fungicidal action of the compounds of the formula I was demonstrated by the following experiments 

The active substances were formulated separately as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO at a concentration of 10 000 ppm.

The stock solution was pipetted into a microtiter plate MTP and diluted to the stated active substance concentration using an aequous biomalt or yeast beactopeptonesodium acetate solution. An aqueous spore suspension of was then added. The plates were placed in a water vapor saturated chamber at temperatures of 18 C. Using an absorption photometer the microtiter plates were measured at 405 nm on day 7 after the inoculation. The measured parameters were compared to the growth of the active substance free control variant 100 and the fungus and active substance free blank value to determine the relative growth in of the pathogens in the individual active substances.

In this test the sample which had been treated with 125 ppm of the active substance from example I 1 showed up to at most 5 growth of the pathogen.

The stock solution were prepared a mixture of acetone and or dimethylsulfoxide and the wetting agent emulsifier Wettol which is based on ethoxylated alkylphenoles in a relation solvent emulsifier of 99 to 1 v v was added to 25 mg of the compound to give a total of 5 ml. Water was then added to total volume of 100 ml.

This stock solution was diluted with the described solvent emulsifier water mixture to the given concentration.

Leaves of pot grown wheat seedling were sprayed to run off with an aqueous suspension of the active compound or their mixture prepared as described. The plants were allowed to air dry. At the following day the plants were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of . Then the trial plants were immediately transferred to a humid chamber at 18 22 C. and a relative humidity close to 100 . After 4 days the plants were transferred to a chamber with 18 22 C. and a relative humidity close to 70 . After 4 weeks the extent of fungal attack on the leaves was visually assessed as diseased leaf area.

In this test the plants which had been treated with 1000 ppm of the active substance from example I 3 showed an infection of less than or equal to 5 whereas the untreated plants were 90 infected.
