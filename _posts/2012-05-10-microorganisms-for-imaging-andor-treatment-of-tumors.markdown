Modified recombinant viruses for diagnosis and therapy are provided. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods using the modified recombinant viruses also are provided.

Cancers such as pancreatic cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma are highly aggressive diseases. The annual incidence in the United States was estimated to be 40 000 cases for pancreatic cancer and 4 000 cases for malignant mesothelioma in the year 2004 with increasing incidence worldwide for mesothelioma especially in industrialized nations due to the etiology of this disease from asbestos exposure Bianchi and Bianchi 2007 45 379 87 . Both of these tumors are highly resistant to standard therapies with 5 year survival rates of only 5 for pancreatic cancer and 9 for mesothelioma. Even with combined surgery chemotherapy and radiation only a small minority of patients are rendered disease free for a prolonged period of time Adusumilli et al. 2006 8 603 15.

Oncolytic viral therapy has been studied and tested over the past century and many viral types including adenovirus herpes simplex virus Newcastle disease virus myxoma virus vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus are being investigated as novel agents for the treatment of human cancer Woo et al. 2006 7 549 59 . Accordingly effective tumor diagnostic and therapeutic viral agents that are highly selective for tumors are needed. In addition there exists a need to provide reagents and methods for tracking and monitoring viral distribution tumor targeting proliferation and persistence in oncolytic viral therapies by noninvasive imaging which provide important safety efficacy and toxicity data. Such real time monitoring also would provide useful viral dose and administration schedule information for optimization of therapy and would obviate the need for multiple and repeated tissue biopsies.

As used herein the term modified virus refers to a virus that is altered with respect to a parental strain of the virus. Typically modified viruses have one or more truncations mutations insertions or deletions in the genome of virus. A modified virus can have one or more endogenous viral genes modified and or one or more intergenic regions modified. Exemplary modified viruses can have one or more heterologous nucleic acid sequences inserted into the genome of the virus. Modified viruses can contain one more heterologous nucleic acid sequences in the form of a gene expression cassette for the expression of a heterologous gene.

As used herein modification of a heterologous nucleic acid molecule with respect to a virus containing a heterologous nucleic acid molecule refers to any alteration of the heterologous nucleic acid molecule including truncations mutations insertions or deletions of the nucleic acid molecule.

Exemplary fluorescent moieties and radionuclides are provided elsewhere herein.

As used herein magnetic resonance imaging MRI refers to the use of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to produce electronic images of specific atoms and molecular structures in solids especially human cells tissues and organs. MRI is non invasive diagnostic technique that uses nuclear magnetic resonance to produce cross sectional images of organs and other internal body structures. The subject lies inside a large hollow cylinder containing a strong electromagnet which causes the nuclei of certain atoms in the body such as for example H C and F to align magnetically. The subject is then subjected to radio waves which cause the aligned nuclei to flip when the radio waves are withdrawn the nuclei return to their original positions emitting radio waves that are then detected by a receiver and translated into a two dimensional picture by computer. For some MRI procedures contrast agents such as gadolinium are used to increase the accuracy of the images.

Nucleic acids can encode for example gene products such as for example polypeptides regulatory RNAs siRNAs and functional RNAs.

As used herein primer refers to an oligonucleotide containing two or more deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides typically more than three from which synthesis of a primer extension product can be initiated. Typically a primer contains a free 3 hydroxy moiety. Experimental conditions conducive to synthesis of a gene product include the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and an agent for polymerization and extension such as DNA polymerase and a suitable buffer temperature and pH. When referring to probes or primers which are optionally labeled such as with a detectable label such as a fluorescent or radiolabel single stranded molecules are provided. Such molecules are typically of a length such that their target is statistically unique or of low copy number typically less than 5 generally less than 3 for probing or priming a library. Generally a probe or primer contains at least 14 16 or 30 contiguous nucleotides of sequence complementary to or identical to a gene of interest. Probes and primers can be 5 6 7 8 9 10 or more 20 or more 30 or more 50 or more 100 or more nucleic acids long.

As used herein a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA with reference to antisense oligonucleotides means a sequence of nucleotides having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA generally under moderate or high stringency conditions forming a stable duplex in the case of double stranded antisense nucleic acids a single strand of the duplex DNA i.e. dsRNA can thus be tested or triplex formation can be assayed. The ability to hybridize depends on the degree of complementarily and the length of the antisense nucleic acid. Generally the longer the hybridizing nucleic acid the more base mismatches with an encoding RNA it can contain and still form a stable duplex or triplex as the case can be . One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.

As used herein a heterologous nucleic acid also referred to as exogenous nucleic acid or foreign nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid that is not normally produced in vivo by an organism or virus from which it is expressed or that is produced by an organism or a virus but is at a different locus expressed differently or that mediates or encodes mediators that alter expression of endogenous nucleic acid such as DNA by affecting transcription translation or other regulatable biochemical processes. Heterologous nucleic acid is often not endogenous to a cell or virus into which it is introduced but has been obtained from another cell or virus or prepared synthetically. Heterologous nucleic acid can refer to a nucleic acid molecule from another cell in the same organism or another organism including the same species or another species. Heterologous nucleic acid however can be endogenous but is nucleic acid that is expressed from a different locus or altered in its expression or sequence e.g. a plasmid . Thus heterologous nucleic acid includes a nucleic acid molecule not present in the exact orientation or position as the counterpart nucleic acid molecule such as DNA is found in a genome. Generally although not necessarily such nucleic acid encodes RNA and proteins that are not normally produced by the cell or virus or in the same way in the cell in which it is expressed. Any nucleic acid such as DNA that one of skill in the art recognizes or considers as heterologous exogenous or foreign to the cell in which the nucleic acid is expressed is herein encompassed by heterologous nucleic acid.

As used herein a heterologous protein or heterologous polypeptide also referred to as exogenous protein exogenous polypeptide foreign protein or foreign polypeptide refers to a protein that is not normally produced in vivo by an organism.

As used herein operative linkage of heterologous nucleic acids to regulatory and effector sequences of nucleotides such as promoters enhancers transcriptional and translational stop sites and other signal sequences refers to the relationship between such nucleic acid such as DNA and such sequences of nucleotides. For example operative linkage of heterologous DNA to a promoter refers to the physical relationship between the DNA and the promoter such that the transcription of such DNA is initiated from the promoter by an RNA polymerase that specifically recognizes binds to and transcribes the DNA. Thus operatively linked or operationally associated refers to the functional relationship of a nucleic acid such as DNA with regulatory and effector sequences of nucleotides such as promoters enhancers transcriptional and translational stop sites and other signal sequences. For example operative linkage of DNA to a promoter refers to the physical and functional relationship between the DNA and the promoter such that the transcription of such DNA is initiated from the promoter by an RNA polymerase that specifically recognizes binds to and transcribes the DNA. In order to optimize expression and or transcription it can be necessary to remove add or alter 5 untranslated portions of the clones to eliminate extra potentially inappropriate alternative translation initiation i.e. start codons or other sequences that can interfere with or reduce expression either at the level of transcription or translation. In addition consensus ribosome binding sites can be inserted immediately 5 of the start codon and can enhance expression see e.g. Kozak 266 19867 19870 1991 Shine and Delgarno 254 5495 34 38 1975 . The desirability of or need for such modification can be empirically determined.

As used herein a promoter a promoter region or a promoter element or regulatory region or regulatory element refers to a segment of DNA or RNA that controls transcription of the DNA or RNA to which it is operatively linked. The promoter region includes specific sequences that are involved in RNA polymerase recognition binding and transcription initiation. In addition the promoter includes sequences that modulate recognition binding and transcription initiation activity of RNA polymerase i.e. binding of one or more transcription factors . These sequences can be cis acting or can be responsive to trans acting factors. Promoters depending upon the nature of the regulation can be constitutive or regulated. Regulated promoters can be inducible or environmentally responsive e.g. respond to cues such as pH anaerobic conditions osmoticum temperature light or cell density . Many such promoter sequences are known in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 980 285 5 631 150 5 707 928 5 759 828 5 888 783 5 919 670 and Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 .

As used herein a native promoter is a promoter that is endogenous to the organism or virus and is unmodified with respect to its nucleotide sequence and its position in the viral genome as compared to a wild type organism or virus.

As used herein a heterologous promoter refers to a promoter that is not normally found in the wild type organism or virus or that is at a different locus as compared to a wild type organism or virus. A heterologous promoter is often not endogenous to a cell or virus into which it is introduced but has been obtained from another cell or virus or prepared synthetically. A heterologous promoter can refer to a promoter from another cell in the same organism or another organism including the same species or another species. A heterologous promoter however can be endogenous but is a promoter that is altered in its sequence or occurs at a different locus e.g. at a different location in the genome or on a plasmid . Thus a heterologous promoter includes a promoter not present in the exact orientation or position as the counterpart promoter is found in a genome.

A synthetic promoter is a heterologous promoter that has a nucleotide sequence that is not found in nature. A synthetic promoter can be a nucleic acid molecule that has a synthetic sequence or a sequence derived from a native promoter or portion thereof. A synthetic promoter can also be a hybrid promoter composed of different elements derived from different native promoters.

As used herein a gene expression cassette or expression cassette is a nucleic acid construct containing nucleic acid elements that are capable of effecting expression of a gene in hosts that are compatible with such sequences. Expression cassettes include at least promoters and optionally transcription termination signals. Typically the expression cassette includes a nucleic acid to be transcribed operably linked to a promoter. Additional factors helpful in effecting expression can also be used as described herein. Expression cassettes can contain genes that encode for example a therapeutic gene product or a detectable protein or a selectable marker gene 

As used herein replacement of a promoter with a stronger promoter refers to removing a promoter from a genome and replacing it with a promoter that effects an increased the level of transcription initiation relative to the promoter that is replaced. Typically a stronger promoter has an improved ability to bind polymerase complexes relative to the promoter that is replaced. As a result an open reading frame that is operably linked to the stronger promoter has a higher level of gene expression. Similarly replacement of a promoter with a weaker promoter refers to removing a promoter from a genome and replacing it with a promoter that decreases the level of transcription initiation relative to the promoter that is replaced. Typically a weaker promoter has a lessened ability to bind polymerase complexes relative to the promoter that is replaced. As a result an open reading frame that is operably linked to the weaker promoter has a lower level of gene expression.

As used herein production by recombinant means by using recombinant DNA methods means the use of the well known methods of molecular biology for expressing proteins encoded by cloned DNA.

As used herein vector or plasmid refers to discrete elements that are used to introduce heterologous nucleic acid into cells for either expression or replication thereof. The vectors typically remain episomal but can be designed to effect integration of a gene or portion thereof into a chromosome of the genome. Selection and use of such vectors are well known to those of skill in the art. An expression vector includes vectors capable of expressing DNA that is operatively linked with regulatory sequences such as promoter regions that are capable of effecting expression of such DNA fragments. Thus an expression vector refers to a recombinant DNA or RNA construct such as a plasmid a phage recombinant virus or other vector that upon introduction into an appropriate host cell results in expression of the cloned DNA. Appropriate expression vectors are well known to those of skill in the art and include those that are replicable in eukaryotic cells and or prokaryotic cells and those that remain episomal or those which integrate into the host cell genome. Vectors can be used in the generation of a recombinant genome by integration or homologous recombination such as in the generation of a recombinant virus as described elsewhere herein.

As used herein genetic therapy or gene therapy involves the transfer of heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA or RNA into certain cells target cells of a mammal particularly a human with a disorder or conditions for which such therapy is sought. As used herein genetic therapy or gene therapy can involve the transfer of heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA into a virus which can be transferred to a mammal particularly a human with a disorder or conditions for which such therapy is sought. The nucleic acid such as DNA is introduced into the selected target cells such as directly or indirectly in a manner such that the heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA is expressed and a therapeutic product encoded thereby is produced. Alternatively the heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA can in some manner mediate expression of DNA that encodes the therapeutic product or it can encode a product such as a peptide or RNA that is in some manner a therapeutic product or which mediates directly or indirectly expression of a therapeutic product. Genetic therapy also can be used to deliver nucleic acid encoding a gene product that replaces a defective gene or supplements a gene product produced by the mammal or the cell in which it is introduced. The introduced nucleic acid can encode a therapeutic compound. The heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA encoding the therapeutic product can be modified prior to introduction into the cells of the afflicted host in order to enhance or otherwise alter the product or expression thereof. Genetic therapy also can involve delivery of an inhibitor or repressor or other modulator of gene expression.

As used herein a therapeutically effective product for gene therapy is a product that is encoded by heterologous nucleic acid typically DNA or an RNA product such as dsRNA RNAi including siRNA that upon introduction of the nucleic acid into a host a product is expressed that ameliorates or eliminates the symptoms manifestations of an inherited or acquired disease or that cures the disease. Also included are biologically active nucleic acid molecules such as RNAi and antisense nucleic acids.

As used herein an agent or compound that modulates the activity of a protein or expression of a gene or nucleic acid either decreases or increases or otherwise alters the activity of the protein or in some manner up or down regulates or otherwise alters expression of the nucleic acid in a cell.

As used herein recitation that amino acids of a polypeptide correspond to amino acids in a disclosed sequence such as amino acids set forth in the Sequence listing refers to amino acids identified upon alignment of the polypeptide with the disclosed sequence to maximize identity or homology where conserved amino acids are aligned using a standard alignment algorithm such as the GAP algorithm. By aligning the sequences of polypeptides one skilled in the art can identify corresponding residues using conserved and identical amino acid residues as guides.

As used herein amino acids are represented by their full name or by their known three letter or one letter abbreviations Table 1 . The nucleotides which occur in the various nucleic acid fragments are designated with the standard single letter designations used routinely in the art.

As used herein the terms homology and identity are used interchangeably but homology for proteins can include conservative amino acid changes. In general to identify corresponding positions the sequences of amino acids are aligned so that the highest order match is obtained see e.g. Lesk A. M. ed. Oxford University Press New York 1988 Smith D. W. ed. Academic Press New York 1993 I Griffin A.M. and Griffin H. G. eds. Humana Press New Jersey 1994 von Heinje G. Academic Press 1987 and Gribskov M. and Devereux J. eds. M Stockton Press New York 1991 Carillo et al. 1988 48 1073 .

As use herein sequence identity refers to the number of identical amino acids or nucleotide bases in a comparison between a test and a reference polypeptide or polynucleotide. Homologous polypeptides refer to a pre determined number of identical or homologous amino acid residues. Homology includes conservative amino acid substitutions as well identical residues. Sequence identity can be determined by standard alignment algorithm programs used with default gap penalties established by each supplier. Homologous nucleic acid molecules refer to a pre determined number of identical or homologous nucleotides. Homology includes substitutions that do not change the encoded amino acid i.e. silent substitutions as well identical residues. Substantially homologous nucleic acid molecules hybridize typically at moderate stringency or at high stringency all along the length of the nucleic acid or along at least about 70 80 or 90 of the full length nucleic acid molecule of interest. Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that contain degenerate codons in place of codons in the hybridizing nucleic acid molecule. For determination of homology of proteins conservative amino acids can be aligned as well as identical amino acids in this case percentage of identity and percentage homology vary . Whether any two nucleic acid molecules have nucleotide sequences or any two polypeptides have amino acid sequences that are at least 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical can be determined using known computer algorithms such as the FAST A program using for example the default parameters as in Pearson et al. 85 2444 1988 other programs include the GCG program package Devereux J. et al. 12 I 387 1984 BLASTP BLASTN FASTA Atschul S. F. et al. 215 403 1990 Martin J. Bishop ed. Academic Press San Diego 1994 and Carillo et al. 48 1073 1988 . For example the BLAST function of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database can be used to determine identity. Other commercially or publicly available programs include DNAStar MegAlign program Madison Wis. and the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group UWG Gap program Madison Wis. . Percent homology or identity of proteins and or nucleic acid molecules can be determined for example by comparing sequence information using a GAP computer program e.g. Needleman et al. 48 443 1970 as revised by Smith and Waterman 2 482 1981 . Briefly a GAP program defines similarity as the number of aligned symbols i.e. nucleotides or amino acids which are similar divided by the total number of symbols in the shorter of the two sequences. Default parameters for the GAP program can include 1 a unary comparison matrix containing a value of 1 for identities and 0 for non identities and the weighted comparison matrix of Gribskov et al. 14 6745 1986 as described by Schwartz and Dayhoff eds. National Biomedical Research Foundation pp. 353 358 1979 2 a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap and 3 no penalty for end gaps. Therefore as used herein the term identity represents a comparison between a test and a reference polypeptide or polynucleotide. In one non limiting example at least 90 identical to refers to percent identities from 90 to 100 relative to the reference polypeptides. Identity at a level of 90 or more is indicative of the fact that assuming for exemplification purposes a test and reference polynucleotide length of 100 amino acids are compared no more than 10 i.e. 10 out of 100 of amino acids in the test polypeptide differs from that of the reference polypeptides. Similar comparisons can be made between a test and reference polynucleotides. Such differences can be represented as point mutations randomly distributed over the entire length of an amino acid sequence or they can be clustered in one or more locations of varying length up to the maximum allowable e.g. 10 100 amino acid difference approximately 90 identity . Differences are defined as nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions insertions or deletions. At the level of homologies or identities above about 85 90 the result should be independent of the program and gap parameters set such high levels of identity can be assessed readily often without relying on software.

The term substantially identical or homologous or similar varies with the context as understood by those skilled in the relevant art and generally means at least 60 or 70 preferably means at least 80 more preferably at least 90 and most preferably at least 95 96 97 98 99 or greater identity. As used herein substantially identical to a product means sufficiently similar so that the property of interest is sufficiently unchanged so that the substantially identical product can be used in place of the product.

As used herein substantially pure means sufficiently homogeneous to appear free of readily detectable impurities as determined by standard methods of analysis such as thin layer chromatography TLC gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography HPLC used by those of skill in the art to assess such purity or sufficiently pure such that further purification would not detectably alter the physical and chemical properties such as enzymatic and biological activities of the substance. Methods for purification of the compounds to produce substantially chemically pure compounds are known to those of skill in the art. A substantially chemically pure compound can however be a mixture of stereoisomers or isomers. In such instances further purification might increase the specific activity of the compound.

As used herein equivalent when referring to two sequences of nucleic acids means that the two sequences in question encode the same sequence of amino acids or equivalent proteins. When equivalent is used in referring to two proteins or peptides or other molecules it means that the two proteins or peptides have substantially the same amino acid sequence with only amino acid substitutions such as but not limited to conservative changes or structure and the any changes do not substantially alter the activity or function of the protein or peptide. When equivalent refers to a property the property does not need to be present to the same extent e.g. two peptides can exhibit different rates of the same type of enzymatic activity but the activities are usually substantially the same. Complementary when referring to two nucleotide sequences means that the two sequences of nucleotides are capable of hybridizing typically with less than 25 15 or 5 mismatches between opposed nucleotides. If necessary the percentage of complementarity will be specified. Typically the two molecules are selected such that they will hybridize under conditions of high stringency.

As used herein a receptor refers to a molecule that has an affinity for a ligand. Receptors can be naturally occurring or synthetic molecules. Receptors also can be referred to in the art as anti ligands. As used herein the receptor and anti ligand are interchangeable. Receptors can be used in their unaltered state or bound to other polypeptides including as homodimers. Receptors can be attached to covalently or noncovalently or in physical contact with a binding member either directly or indirectly via a specific binding substance or linker. Examples of receptors include but are not limited to antibodies cell membrane receptors surface receptors and internalizing receptors monoclonal antibodies and antisera reactive with specific antigenic determinants such as on viruses cells or other materials drugs polynucleotides nucleic acids peptides cofactors lectins sugars polysaccharides cells cellular membranes and organelles.

As used herein bind bound and binding refer to the binding between atoms or molecules with a IQ in the range of 10to 10mole L generally 10to 10 10to 10and typically 10to 10 and or a Kof 10 10 10 10 10 10L mole .

As used herein luminescence refers to the detectable electromagnetic EM radiation generally ultraviolet UV infrared IR or visible EM radiation that is produced when the excited product of an exergonic chemical process reverts to its ground state with the emission of light. Chemiluminescence is luminescence that results from a chemical reaction. Bioluminescence is chemiluminescence that results from a chemical reaction using biological molecules or synthetic versions or analogs thereof as substrates and or enzymes. Fluorescence is luminescence in which light of a visible color is emitted from a substance under stimulation or excitation by light or other forms radiation such as ultraviolet UV infrared IR or visible EM radiation.

As used herein chemiluminescence refers to a chemical reaction in which energy is specifically channeled to a molecule causing it to become electronically excited and subsequently to release a photon thereby emitting visible light. Temperature does not contribute to this channeled energy. Thus chemiluminescence involves the direct conversion of chemical energy to light energy.

As used herein bioluminescence which is a type of chemiluminescence refers to the emission of light by biological molecules particularly proteins. The essential condition for bioluminescence is molecular oxygen either bound or free in the presence of an oxygenase a luciferase which acts on a substrate a luciferin. Bioluminescence is generated by an enzyme or other protein luciferase that is an oxygenase that acts on a substrate luciferin a bioluminescence substrate in the presence of molecular oxygen and transforms the substrate to an excited state which upon return to a lower energy level releases the energy in the form of light.

As used herein the substrates and enzymes for producing bioluminescence are generically referred to as luciferin and luciferase respectively. When reference is made to a particular species thereof for clarity each generic term is used with the name of the organism from which it derives such as for example click beetle luciferase or firefly luciferase.

As used herein luciferase refers to oxygenases that catalyze a light emitting reaction. For instance bacterial luciferases catalyze the oxidation of flavin mononucleotide FMN and aliphatic aldehydes which reaction produces light. Another class of luciferases found among marine arthropods catalyzes the oxidation of Cypridina Vargula luciferin and another class of luciferases catalyzes the oxidation of Coleoptera luciferin.

Thus luciferase refers to an enzyme or photoprotein that catalyzes a bioluminescent reaction a reaction that produces bioluminescence . The luciferases such as firefly and Gaussia and luciferases are enzymes which act catalytically and are unchanged during the bioluminescence generating reaction. The luciferase photoproteins such as the aequorin photoprotein to which luciferin is non covalently bound are changed such as by release of the luciferin during bioluminescence generating reaction. The luciferase is a protein or a mixture of proteins e.g. bacterial luciferase that occurs naturally in an organism or a variant or mutant thereof such as a variant produced by mutagenesis that has one or more properties such as thermal stability that differ from the naturally occurring protein. Luciferases and modified mutant or variant forms thereof are well known. For purposes herein reference to luciferase refers to either the photoproteins or luciferases.

Thus reference for example to luciferase refers to an enzyme isolated from member of the genus or an equivalent molecule obtained from any other source such as from another related copepod or that has been prepared synthetically. It is intended to encompass luciferases with conservative amino acid substitutions that do not substantially alter activity. Conservative substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and can be made generally without altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that in general single amino acid substitutions in non essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity see e.g. Watson et al. 4th Edition 1987 The Benjamin Cummings Pub. co. p. 224 .

As used herein bioluminescence substrate refers to the compound that is oxidized in the presence of a luciferase and any necessary activators and generates light. These substrates are referred to as luciferins herein are substrates that undergo oxidation in a bioluminescence reaction. These bioluminescence substrates include any luciferin or analog thereof or any synthetic compound with which a luciferase interacts to generate light. Typical substrates include those that are oxidized in the presence of a luciferase or protein in a light generating reaction. Bioluminescence substrates thus include those compounds that those of skill in the art recognize as luciferins. Luciferins for example include firefly luciferin Cypridina also known as Vargula luciferin coelenterazine bacterial luciferin as well as synthetic analogs of these substrates or other compounds that are oxidized in the presence of a luciferase in a reaction the produces bioluminescence.

As used herein capable of conversion into a bioluminescence substrate refers to being susceptible to chemical reaction such as oxidation or reduction which yields a bioluminescence substrate. For example the luminescence producing reaction of bioluminescent bacteria involves the reduction of a flavin mononucleotide group FMN to reduced flavin mononucleotide FMNH by a flavin reductase enzyme. The reduced flavin mononucleotide substrate then reacts with oxygen an activator and bacterial luciferase to form an intermediate peroxy flavin that undergoes further reaction in the presence of a long chain aldehyde to generate light. With respect to this reaction the reduced flavin and the long chain aldehyde are bioluminescence substrates.

As used herein a bioluminescence generating system refers to the set of reagents required to conduct a bioluminescent reaction. Thus the specific luciferase luciferin and other substrates solvents and other reagents that can be required to complete a bioluminescent reaction form a bioluminescence system. Thus a bioluminescence generating system refers to any set of reagents that under appropriate reaction conditions yield bioluminescence. Appropriate reaction conditions refer to the conditions necessary for a bioluminescence reaction to occur such as pH salt concentrations and temperature. In general bioluminescence systems include a bioluminescence substrate luciferin a luciferase which includes enzymes luciferases and photoproteins and one or more activators. A specific bioluminescence system can be identified by reference to the specific organism from which the luciferase derives for example the bioluminescence system includes a luciferase such as a luciferase isolated from or produced using recombinant methods or modifications of these luciferases. This system also includes the particular activators necessary to complete the bioluminescence reaction such as oxygen and a substrate with which the luciferase reacts in the presence of the oxygen to produce light.

As used herein a fluorescent protein FP refers to a protein that possesses the ability to fluoresce i.e. to absorb energy at one wavelength and emit it at another wavelength . For example a green fluorescent protein GFP refers to a polypeptide that has a peak in the emission spectrum at 510 nm or about 510 nm. A variety of FPs that emit at various wavelengths are known in the art. Exemplary FPs include but are not limited to a green fluorescent protein GFP yellow fluorescent protein YFP orange fluorescent protein OFP cyan fluorescent protein CFP blue fluorescent protein BFP red fluorescent protein RFP far red fluorescent protein or near infrared fluorescent protein. Extending the spectrum of available colors of fluorescent proteins to blue cyan orange yellow and red variants provides a method for multicolor tracking of fusion proteins.

As used herein GFP refers to GFPs from the genus and to mutants or variants thereof. Such variants and GFPs from other species such as reef coral sea anemone sea pansy coral brown coral and stony coral and other species are well known and are available and known to those of skill in the art.

RFPs include for example variants such as mRFP1 mCherry tdTomato mStrawberry mTangerine Wang et al. 101 48 16745 9 2004 DsRed2 Clontech Palo Alto Calif. and DsRed T1 Bevis and Glick 20 83 87 2002 J Red Evrogen and AsRed2 Clontech Palo Alto Calif. . Far red fluorescent proteins include for example AQ143 Shkrob et al.

As used herein the term assessing or determining is intended to include quantitative and qualitative determination in the sense of obtaining an absolute value for the activity of a product and also of obtaining an index ratio percentage visual or other value indicative of the level of the activity. Assessment can be direct or indirect.

As used herein activity refers to the in vivo activities of a compound or viruses on physiological responses that result following in vivo administration thereof or of a composition or other mixture . Activity thus encompasses resulting therapeutic effects and pharmaceutical activity of such compounds compositions and mixtures. Activities can be observed in vitro and or in vivo systems designed to test or use such activities.

As used herein a vaccine refers to a composition which upon administration to a subject elicits an immune response in a subject to which it is administered and which protects the immunized subject against subsequent challenge by the immunizing agent or an immunologically cross reactive agent. A vaccine can be used to enhance the immune response against a pathogen such as a virus that expresses the immunological agent and or has already infected the subject. Protection can be complete or partial i.e. a reduction in symptoms or infection as compared with an unvaccinated subject . Typically a vaccine is administered to a subject that is a mammal. An immunologically cross reactive agent can be for example the whole protein e.g. tumor antigen from which a subunit peptide used as the immunogen is derived. Alternatively an immunologically cross reactive agent can be a different protein which is recognized in whole or in part by the antibodies elicited by the immunizing agent. Exemplary vaccines can be modified vaccinia viruses that express an immunologically cross reactive agent.

As used herein a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier refers to any carrier diluent excipient wetting agent buffering agent suspending agent lubricating agent adjuvant solid binder vehicle delivery system emulsifier disintegrant absorbent preservative surfactant colorant flavorant or sweetener preferably non toxic that are suitable for use in a pharmaceutical composition.

As used herein complex refers generally to an association between two or more species regardless of the nature of the interaction between the species i.e. ionic covalent or electrostatic .

As used herein a combination refers to any association between two or among more items or elements. Exemplary combinations include but are not limited to two or more pharmaceutical compositions a composition containing two or more active ingredients such as two viruses or a virus and a chemotherapeutic compound two or more viruses a virus and a therapeutic agent a virus and an imaging agent a virus and a plurality therapeutic and or imaging agents or any association thereof. Such combinations can be packaged as kits.

As used herein a composition refers to any mixture. It can be a solution a suspension an emulsion liquid powder a paste aqueous non aqueous or any combination of such ingredients.

As used herein a kit is a packaged combination optionally including instructions for use of the combination and or other reactions and components for such use.

For clarity of disclosure and not by way of limitation the detailed description is divided into the subsections that follow.

Provided herein are viruses for therapeutic and diagnostic use. Also provided elsewhere herein are methods for making and using such viruses for therapeutic and diagnostic uses. The viruses provided herein encode gene products that can enhance the uptake or retention of compounds useful for diagnostic and or therapeutic purposes. Exemplary of such viruses are viruses that encode a transporter protein. The viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein can localize to and infect target cells such as tumor cells resulting expression of the transporter protein by the infected cells. Transporter proteins expressed by an infected cell can result in increased uptake diagnostic and therapeutic moieties across the cell membrane. Diagnostic moieties include those that can emit a signal that is detectable by optical or non optical imaging methods. Detection of the signal by imaging modalities such as for example by positron emission tomography PET and thereby allows visualization of the infected tissues such a tumor or an inflammation.

Exemplary diagnostic moieties are provided elsewhere herein and include radiolabeled compounds that can be imaged in a subject. The uptake of such compounds by the expressed transporter protein allows amplification of signal emitted by the compounds due to the increased accumulation of the labeled compound in the infected cells. Hence the transporter based imaging methods using the viruses provided herein can result in greater signal strength at the target tissue as compared to receptor based imaging methods because a higher number of diagnostic moieties can be taken up by the infected cells as compared to the limited binding of one moiety to one receptor. Thus such methods can provide high signal to noise ratios in vivo for infected versus non infected tissues.

Exemplary transporter proteins that can be encoded by the viruses provided herein are listed elsewhere herein and include for example the human norepinephrine transporter hNET and the human sodium iodide symporter hNIS . Exemplary viruses provided herein that encode the human norepinephrine transporter hNET include but are not limited to GLV 1h99 GLV 1h100 GLV 1h101 GLV 1h139 GLV 1h146 and GLV 1h150. Exemplary viruses provided herein that encode the human sodium iodide symporter hNIS include but are not limited to GLV 1h151 GLV 1h152 and GLV 1h153.

The viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein are typically attenuated. Attenuated viruses have a decreased capacity to cause disease in a host. The decreased capacity can result from any of a variety of different modifications to the ability of a virus to be pathogenic. For example a virus can have reduced toxicity reduced ability to accumulate in non tumorous organs or tissue reduced ability to cause cell lysis or cell death or reduced ability to replicate compared to the non attenuated form thereof. The attenuated viruses provided herein however retain at least some capacity to replicate and to cause immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells to leak or lyse undergo cell death or otherwise cause or enhance an immune response to immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells. Such characteristics of the viruses provided are described in detail elsewhere herein.

The viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein can accumulate in and infect immunoprivileged cells or immunoprivileged tissues including tumors and or metastases and also including inflamed or wounded tissues and cells. While the viruses provided herein can typically be cleared from the subject to whom the viruses are administered by activity of the subject s immune system viruses can nevertheless accumulate survive and proliferate in immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumors because such immunoprivileged areas are sequestered from the host s immune system. Accordingly the methods provided herein as applied to tumors and or metastases and diagnostic and therapeutic methods relating thereto can readily be applied to other immunoprivileged cells and tissues including inflamed and wounded cells and tissues.

Among the viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein are cytoplasmic viruses which do not require entry of viral nucleic acid molecules in to the nucleus of the host cell during the viral life cycle. Exemplary cytoplasmic viruses provided herein are viruses of the poxvirus family including orthopoxviruses. Exemplary of poxviruses provided herein are vaccinia viruses. Vaccinia virus possesses a variety of features for use in cancer gene therapy and vaccination including broad host and cell type range a large carrying capacity for foreign genes and high sequence homology among different strains for designing and generating modified viruses in other strains. Techniques for production of modified vaccinia strains by genetic engineering are well established Moss 1993 3 86 90 Broder and Earl 1999 13 223 245 Timiryasova et al. 2001 31 534 540 . A variety of vaccinia virus strains are available including Western Reserve WR Copenhagen Tashkent Tian Tan Lister Wyeth IHD J and IHD W Brighton Ankara MVA Dairen I LIPV LC16M8 LC16MO LIVP WR 65 16 Connaught New York City Board of Health. Exemplary of vaccinia viruses provided herein are Lister strain or LIVP vaccinia viruses.

The modifications of the Lister strain provided herein also can be adapted to other vaccinia viruses e.g. Western Reserve WR Copenhagen Tashkent Tian Tan Lister Wyeth IHD J and IHD W Brighton Ankara MVA Dairen I LIPV LC16M8 LC16MO LIVP WR 65 16 Connaught New York City Board of Health . The modifications of the Lister strain provided herein also can be adapted to other viruses including but not limited to viruses of the poxvirus family adenoviruses herpes viruses and retroviruses.

Typically DNA encoding the transporter protein is inserted into a nonessential gene of the virus genome that does not significantly affecting viral replication and infection in the target tissue. For example in a vaccinia virus non essential gene loci include but are not limited to TK HA F14.5L E2L E3L K1L K2L superoxide dismutase locus 7.5K C7 K1L J2R B13R B14R A56R A26L or 14L gene loci. The heterologous nucleic acid encoding the transporter is typically operably linked to a promoter for expression of the transporter protein in the infected cells. Suitable promoter include viral promoters such as a vaccinia virus natural and synthetic promoters. Exemplary vaccinia viral promoters include but are not limited to P11k P7.5 k early late P7.5 k early P28 late synthetic early P synthetic early late Pand synthetic late Ppromoters.

Exemplary vaccinia viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein were derived from vaccinia virus strain GLV 1h68 also named RVGL21 SEQ ID NO 1 . GLV 1h68 which has been described in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005 0031643 contains DNA insertions gene loci of the vaccinia virus LIVP strain a vaccinia virus strain originally derived by adapting the Lister strain ATCC Catalog No. VR 1549 to calf skin Institute of Viral Preparations Moscow Russia Al tshtein et al. 1983 Dokl. Akad. Nauk USSR 285 696 699 . GLV 1h68 contains expression cassettes encoding detectable marker proteins in the F14.5L also designated in LIVP as F3 gene locus thymidine kinase TK gene locus and hemagglutinin HA gene locus. An expression cassette containing a Ruc GFP cDNA molecule a fusion of DNA encoding luciferase and DNA encoding GFP under the control of a vaccinia synthetic early late promoter P P Ruc GFP was inserted into the F14.5L gene locus an expression cassette containing a DNA molecule encoding beta galactosidase under the control of the vaccinia early late promoter P P LacZ and DNA encoding a rat transferrin receptor positioned in the reverse orientation for transcription relative to the vaccinia synthetic early late promoter P P rTrfR was inserted into the TK gene locus the resulting virus does not express transferrin receptor protein since the DNA molecule encoding the protein is positioned in the reverse orientation for transcription relative to the promoter in the cassette and an expression cassette containing a DNA molecule encoding glucuronidase under the control of the vaccinia late promoter P P gusA was inserted into the HA gene locus. The GLV 1h68 virus exhibited a strong preference for accumulation in tumor tissues as compared to non tumorous tissues following systemic administration of the virus to tumor bearing subjects. This preference was significantly higher than the tumor selective accumulation of other vaccinia viral strains such as WR see e.g. U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005 0031643 and Zhang et al. 2007 67 20 10038 46 . The viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein were generated by replacement of one or more expression cassettes of the GLV 1h68 strain with heterologous DNA encoding a transporter protein.

In some examples nucleic acid encoding the transporter protein can be introduced into a viral genome that contains one or more additional heterologous genes or is modified by removal or replacement of one or more viral genes to attenuate the virus. The heterologous genes can encode additional diagnostic or therapeutic proteins as described elsewhere herein. Non limiting examples viruses that can be modified by insertion of a nucleic acid encoding a transporter protein include attenuated Lister strain LIVP viruses including but not limited to LIVP viruses described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005 0031643 2004 0234455 and 2004 0213741 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 975 088. Exemplary viruses contained therein that can be modified as described here include viruses which have one or more expression cassettes removed from GLV 1h68 and replaced with a heterologous non coding DNA molecule e.g. GLV 1h70 GLV 1h71 GLV 1h72 GLV 1h73 GLV 1h74 GLV 1h85 and GLV 1h86 . GLV 1h70 contains P Ruc GFP inserted into the F14.5L gene locus P rTrfR and P LacZ inserted into the TK gene locus and a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the HA gene locus in place of P gusA. GLV 1h71 contains a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the F14.5L gene locus in place of P Ruc GFP P rTrfR and P LacZ inserted into the TK gene locus and P gusA inserted into the HA gene locus. GLV 1h72 contains P Ruc GFP inserted into the F14.5L gene locus a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the TK gene locus in place of P rTrfR and P LacZ and PgusA inserted into the HA gene locus. GLV 1h73 contains a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the F14.5L gene locus in place of P Ruc GFP P rTrfR and P LacZ inserted into the TK gene locus and a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the HA gene locus in place of P gusA. GLV 1h74 contains a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the F14.5L gene locus in place of P Ruc GFP a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the TK gene locus in place of P rTrfR and P LacZ and a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the HA gene locus in place of P gusA. GLV 1h85 contains a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the F14.5L gene locus in place of P Ruc GFP a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the TK gene locus in place of P rTrfR and P LacZ and P gusA inserted into the HA gene locus. GLV 1h86 Contains P Ruc GFP inserted into the F14.5L gene locus a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the TK gene locus in place of P rTrfR and P LacZ and a non coding DNA molecule inserted into the HA gene locus in place of P gusA. Other exemplary viruses include but are not limited to LIVP viruses that express one or more therapeutic gene products such as angiogenesis inhibitors e.g. GLV 1h81 which contains DNA encoding the plasminogen K5 domain SEQ ID NO 109 under the control of the vaccinia synthetic early late promoter in place of the gusA expression cassette in GLV 1h68 GLV 1h104 GLV 1h105 and GLV 1h106 which contain DNA encoding a truncated human tissue factor fused to the integrin RGD binding motif tTF RGD SEQ ID NO 105 under the control of a vaccinia synthetic early promoter vaccinia synthetic early late promoter or vaccinia synthetic late promoter respectively in place of the LacZ rTFr expression cassette at the TK locus of GLV 1h68 GLV 1h107 GLV 1h108 and GLV 1h109 which contain DNA encoding an anti VEGF single chain antibody G6 SEQ ID NO 106 under the control of a vaccinia synthetic early promoter vaccinia synthetic early late promoter or vaccinia synthetic late promoter respectively in place of the LacZ rTFr expression cassette at the TK locus of GLV 1h68 and proteins for tumor growth suppression e.g. GLV 1h90 GLV 1h91 and GLV 1h92 which express a fusion protein containing an IL 6 fused to an IL 6 receptor sIL 6R IL 6 SEQ ID NO 108 under the control of a vaccinia synthetic early promoter vaccinia synthetic early late promoter or vaccinia synthetic late promoter respectively in place of the gusA expression cassette in GLV 1h68 and GLV 1h96 GLV 1h97 and GLV 1h98 which express IL 24 melanoma differentiation gene mda 7 SEQ ID NO 107 under the control of a vaccinia synthetic early promoter vaccinia synthetic early late promoter or vaccinia synthetic late promoter respectively in place of the Ruc GFP fusion gene expression cassette at the F14.5L locus of GLV 1h68 . Additional therapeutic gene products that can be engineered in the viruses provided herein also are described elsewhere herein.

Membrane transport proteins also known as transporters are proteins involved in the movement of ions small molecules or macromolecules such as other proteins across a membrane. Transport proteins are integral membrane proteins that span the membrane across which they transport substances. These proteins can assist in the movement of substances by facilitated diffusion or active transport. Transporters can be located on the outer cell membrane mitochondria or other intracellular organelles. When expressed in viruses using the methods described herein these transporters can function to transport and accumulate detectable and or therapeutic substrates in cells such as tumor cells. For example transporters can provide signal amplification through transport mediated concentrative intracellular accumulation of radiolabeled substrates for use in imaging and can provide a means to deliver therapeutic substances to virally targeted tumors.

Transporters can be classified and identified using various systems and databases well known in the art. Such systems can be used to help identify transporters that can be expressed in the viruses using the methods described herein and to identify the substrates for each transporter. For example the Transporter Classification database TCDB www.tcdb.org is an IUBMB International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology approved classification system for membrane transport proteins including ion channels Saier et al. 2006 Nucl. Acids. Res. 34 D181 D186 . This was designed to be analogous to the EC number system for classifying enzymes but it also uses phylogenetic information. The TC system classifies approximately 3000 proteins into over 550 transporter families. Another system is the Solute Carrier SLC gene nomenclature system which is the basis for the Human Genome Organization HUGO names of the genes that encode this group of transporters and includes over 300 members organized into 47 families. Members within an individual SLC family have greater than 20 sequence homology to each other. The criteria for inclusion of a family into the SLC group is functional i.e. an integral membrane protein which transports a solute rather than evolutionary. The SLC group include transporters that are facilitative transporters allow solutes to flow downhill with their electrochemical gradients and secondary active transporters allow solutes to flow uphill against their electrochemical gradient by coupling to transport of a second solute that flows downhill with its gradient such that the overall free energy change is still favorable . The SLC group does not include ATP driven transporters ion channels or aquaporins. Most members of the SLC group are located in the outer cell membrane although some members are located in mitochondria most notably SLC family 25 or other intracellular organelles. Table 2 provides the SLC families e.g. SLC1 the subfamiles e.g. SLC1A and the member of the family e.g. SLC1A1 corresponding to Solute carrier family 1 member 1 .

Exemplary of transporters for use in the viruses and methods described herein are members of the sodium and chloride dependent neurotransmitter transporter family Solute carrier family 6 SLC6 also known as the sodium neurotransmitter symporter family SNF or the neurotransmitter sodium symporter family NSS of neurotransmitter transporters which corresponds to TC 2.A.22 using the TCDB system . Transporters in this family derive energy from the co transport of Na and Cl in order to transport neurotransmitter molecules into the cell against their concentration gradient. The family has a common structure of 12 conserved transmembrane helices and includes transporters for gamma aminobutyric acid GABA noradrenaline adrenaline dopamine serotonin proline glycine choline betaine and taurine. Sequence analysis of the Na Cl neurotransmitter superfamily reveals that it can be divided into four subfamilies these being transporters for monoamines the amino acids proline and glycine GABA and a group of orphan transporters Nelson et al. 1998 Methods Enzymol. 296 425 436 . Table 3 sets forth the gene name of exemplary members of this family the corresponding protein name and the sequence identifier of the corresponding human protein.

The norepinephrine transporter NET is a sodium chloride dependent neurotransmitter symporter located primarily on the plasma membrane of noradrenergic neurons that removes norepinephrine NE from the extracellular space by high affinity reuptake into presynaptic terminals. NET also is referred to as the sodium dependent noradrenaline transporter noradrenaline Na symporter SLC6A2 TC 2.A.22.1.2 and solute carrier family 6 neurotransmitter transporter noradrenalin member 2. The NET not only regulates the longevity of norepinephrine in the synapse but also plays an important role in presynaptic and postsynaptic homeostasis. The norepinephrine transporter belongs to NET is a monoamine transporter which like other monoamine transporters such as the dopamine transporter DAT and the serotonin transporter SAT transfers monoamine neurottransmitters in and out of cells.

The norepinephrine transporter NET is encoded by the SLC6A2 gene. The cloned human NET cDNA Pacholcznyk et al. 1991 Nature 350 350 354 is an 1857 base pair open reading frame SEQ ID NO 25 encoding a 617 amino acid polypeptide SEQ ID NO 26 with 12 transmembrane domains. The human NET shows sequence and structural similarity to norepinephrine transporters from other species including but not limited to bovine SEQ ID NO 27 mouse SEQ ID NO 28 rat SEQ ID NO 29 rhesus macaque SEQ ID NO 30 chicken SEQ ID NO 31 ovine fragment SEQ ID NO 32 and Japanese quail SEQ ID NO 33 . In addition to multiple single amino acid variants such as those set forth in SEQ ID NOS 45 60 there are three known C terminal isoforms of human NET resulting from alternative splicing. Typically exon 14 of the human NET gene encodes the last 7 amino acids of the 617 amino acid polypeptide SEQ ID NO 26 . In the two additional variants alternative splicing joins exon 13 to a new exon 15 skipping exon 14 . The alternatively spliced exon 15 encodes for either 3 or 18 amino acids resulting in polypeptides with a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NOS 61 and 62 respectively Distelmaier et al. 2004 J. Neurochem. 91 537 546 . It has been observed that while there was no difference in the binding abilities of these isoforms expression of the long C terminal NET splice variant SEQ ID NO 62 exerted a dominant negative effect on cell surface expression of the wild type 617 amino acid NET. It has been postulated therefore that this isoform may be involved in a mechanism for a regulating noradrenergic neurotransmission Distelmaier et al. 2004 J. Neurochem. 91 53 7 546 .

Like other sodium neurotransmitter symporter family members the human NET protein contains 12 hydrophobic segments each of 18 25 amino acids in length forming the transmembrane domains TM1 to TM12 . The amino and carboxy termini are located in the cytoplasmic space. There are three possible N glycosylation sites located on the extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 at amino acid positions 184 192 and 198 of SEQ ID NO 26 . N linked glycosylation of NET results in increased cellular expression of the transporter Nguyen et al. 1996 J. Neurochem. 67 645 655 Melikian et al. 1996 Mol. Pharmacol. 50 266 276 .

Human NET is expressed almost exclusively in the central and peripheral sympathetic nervous system on the plasma membrane of noradrenergic neurons where it functions to take up synaptically released norepinephrine. NET mRNA expression is localized to monoaminergic cell bodies rather than to nerve terminals and is generally restricted to cells that synthesize the corresponding NE. As such NET mRNA expression in the brain is an indicator for noradrenergic pathways with cell bodies primarily located in the brain stem and in the locus coeruleus complex in the dorsal pons particularly in the nucleus locus coeruleus proper. NET mRNA also is expressed in the lateral tegmentum of the medulla and pons. All these regions encompass most of the noradrenergic cell bodies in the CNS. In the periphery NET mRNA is expressed in sympathetic ganglia in the adrenal medulla and the placenta B nisch H and Br ss M. 2006 Handb Exp Pharmacol. 175 485 524 .

NET acts as the primary mechanism for the inactivation of noradrenergic signaling. Norepinephrine also known as noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter found in the sympathetic nervous system and is an important neurochemical messenger in the central nervous system playing a crucial role in physiology and pathology. NE is involved in mood regulation sleep regulation expression of behavior memory and the extent of alertness and arousal. NE also exerts control over the endocrine system and autonomic nervous system and is involved in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure. Reuptake of NE by NET is the primary mechanism by which the biological effects of NE in the synapse are terminated. Thus NET is critical in preventing excessive increases of NE concentrations in the synaptic cleft which regulate adrenergic neurotransmission in the brain as well as the removal of NE from the heart and other peripheral organs Tellioglu et al. 2001 Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 19 November . Approximately 70 90 of the NE released into the synapses is cleared by this mechanism while the remaining 10 30 leaks out into the circulation or extraneuronal tissue Esler et al. 1990 Physiol. Rev. 70 963 985 .

In addition to the transport of NE the norepinephrine transporter also has been shown in vitro using human NET transfected cells to transport other substrates including but not limited to dopamine epinephrine metaraminol tyramine phenylethylamine d amphetamine ephedrine and serotonin in addition to other substances including but not limited to the drugs tranylcypromine selegiline and amezinium the adrenergic neuron blocking agents bretylium and guanethidine meta iodobenzylguanadine MIBG the covalently binding NET suicide substrates and noradrenergic neurotoxins xylamine and DSP 4 the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1 methyl 4 tetrahydropyridinium MPP and the fluorescent model substrate ASP B nisch H and Br ss M. 2006 Handb Exp Pharmacol. 175 485 524 . In addition to binding substrates NET also binds various molecules that act as inhibitors including but not limited to antidepressants such as desipramine nortriptyline reboxetine maprotiline and nomifensine and other substances such as nisoxetine sibutramine atomoxetine RTI 55 and cocaine B nisch H and Br ss M. 2006 Handb Exp Pharmacol. 175 485 524 .

Substrate transport by the NET is dependent on Na and Cl ions and the Na gradient across the plasma membrane that drives the intracellular accumulation of the substrate. Studies indicate that sequential binding of Na and then Cl is required for substrate binding to the transporter B nisch H and Br ss M. 1994 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 733 193 202 . Following binding of the substrate both Na and Cl are co transported with the substrate into the cytoplasm. The ion pump NaK ATPase is the driving force for this transport by maintaining a Na concentration gradient across the plasma membrane. Na and Cl dependent transport of NE and other substrates into the cytoplasm also requires a balance of K ions across the cell membrane.

Exemplary of transporters for use in the viruses and methods described herein are members of the sodium glucose cotransporter family Solute carrier family 5 SLC5 also known as the sodium solute symporter family SSSF or TC 2.A.21. This family has over a hundred members of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. The family members typically have 11 to 15 transmembrane domains TMs in alpha helical conformation. Proteins of this family utilize a sodium motive force the energy stored in an inwardly directed electrochemical sodium gradient to drive uphill transport of substrates such as sugars amino acids vitamins ions myo inositol phenyl acetate urea and water. Most of the transporters are part of catabolic pathways and are used by the cells to acquire the corresponding substrate. Among the best characterized members of the SSSF are the human sodium glucose transporter SGLT1 the sodium iodide transporter NIS and PutP of . Table 4 sets forth the gene name of exemplary members of the SLC5 family the corresponding protein name and the sequence identifier of the corresponding human protein.

The sodium iodide symporter NIS is an ion pump that transports iodide I into thyroid epithelial cells across the basolateral plasma membrane an important step in the process of iodide organification and the formation of triiodothyronine T and thyroxine T . NIS also is referred to as the Sodium iodide cotransporter Na I cotransporter SLC5A5 TC 2.A.21.5.1 and solute carrier family 5 member 5. 

The human sodium iodide symporter gene SLC5A5 encodes a glycoprotein of 643 amino acids SEQ ID NO 63 with a molecular mass of approximately 70 90 kDa. The gene has 15 exons and has an open reading frame of 1929 nucleotides SEQ ID NO 64 . The NIS is predicted to have a 13 transmembrane segment pattern with the N terminus facing the extracellular milieu and the COOH terminus facing the cytosol Levy et al. 1997 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 94 5568 5573. . The human NIS shares sequence and structural similarity to NIS proteins from other species including but not limited to the NIS from mouse SEQ ID NO 65 rat SEQ ID NO 66 Zebrafish SEQ ID NO 67 and African clawed frog mouse SEQ ID NO 68 . Multiple natural variants of human NIS also exist including but not limited to those set forth in SEQ ID NOS 87 94 . Synthetic variants of hNIS also are available and include hNIS transporters with multiple lysine residues inserted at that C terminus of the protein see e.g. PCT Patent publication 2004 000236 which increases the net positive electrostatic charge of the protein allowing increased transport of NIS substrates.

There are at least two potential sites of glycosylation in the human NIS at amino acid positions 489 502 of SEQ ID NO 63. However studies using rat NIS indicate that glycosylation does not play an important role in the stability activity or targeting to the membrane of the symporter Levy et al. 1998 J. Biol. Chem. 273 22657 22663 . NIS also a phosphoprotein Riedel et al. 2001 J. Biol. Chem. 276 21458 21463 . Amino acid position 556 of the human NIS polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 63 is a potential site for phosphorylation by phosphokinase A PKA .

The NIS is an intrinsic transmembrane protein that is expressed on the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells and mediates the accumulation of iodide from the bloodstream to thyroid follicles as the crucial first step for thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The thyroid hormones Tand Tare the only iodine containing hormones in vertebrates. Because I is an essential constituent of Tand T thyroid function depends on an adequate supply of I to the gland. In normal thyroid tissue NIS transports Na I ions at a 2 1 stoichiometry down the Na ion gradient that generated from the activity of Na K ATPase. NIS actively transports iodide producing an iodine concentration gradient from the thyroid cell to extracellular fluid greater than 30 1. This process is stimulated by thyrotropin TSH and inhibitable by the competitive inhibitors thiocyanate SCN and perchlorate ClO . I is then translocated from the cytoplasm across the apical plasma membrane toward the colloid in a process called I efflux. I is oxidized and incorporated into tyrosyl residues within the thyroglobulin Tg molecule leading to the subsequent coupling of iodotyrosine residues at the cell colloid interface. This process is called organification of I. Iodinated Tg is stored extracellularly in the colloid. In response to demand for thyroid hormones phagolysosomal hydrolysis of endocytosed iodinated Tg is effected. Tand Tare secreted into the bloodstream and nonsecreted iodotyrosines are metabolized to tyrosine and I Dohan et al. 2003 Endocrine Reviews 24 48 77 .

The human NIS also is expressed in extrathyroidal tissues including the salivary gland gastric mucosa mammary gland ciliary body of the eye and the choroid plexus. Thus NIS also mediates active I transport in other tissues including salivary glands gastric mucosa and lactating mammary gland although this process is not stimulated by TSH in these tissues Dohan et al. 2003 Endocrine Reviews 24 48 77 . Whereas the functional significance of NIS in the gastric mucosa and salivary glands is unknown in the lactating mammary gland NIS mediates the translocation of I into the milk making this anion available for the nursing newborn to biosynthesize his her own thyroid hormones. Studies using whole body imaging with radioiodide indicate that lactating breast tissue concentrates a significant amount of iodide as a result of stimulation of NIS expression. The trapped iodide is secreted in milk and provides iodine for thyroid hormone synthesis to the developing infant Kogai et al. 2006 Endocrine Related Cancer 13 797 826 .

The ability of the thyroid to accumulate I via NIS has enabled diagnostic scintigraphic imaging of the thyroid with radioiodide and has served as an effective means for therapeutic doses of radioiodide to target and destroy hyperfunctioning thyroid tissue such as in Graves disease and I transporting thyroid cancer and its metastases. The expression of NIS on various thyroid tumors can differ. For example in some studies reduced expression of NIS mRNA and protein was been observed in papillary and follicular thyroid cancer while other studies indicated increased NIS expression in papillary Kogai et al. 2006 Endocrine Realted Cancer 13 797 826 . In addition to being expressed on thyroid tumors NIS expression has been demonstrated in more than 80 of breast cancer tissue Wapnir et al. 2003 J. Clin. End. Met. 88 1880 1888 . As a result agents that stimulate NIS expression in breast cancer sufficient to concentrate radioiodide have been considered as a source of potential therapy for some differentiated breast cancer Boelaert et al. 2003 Lancet 361 796 797 .

In addition to transporting I ions studies have indicated that NIS also can transport additional anions including but not limited to ClO SCN SeCN NO BR BF IO and BrO ClO ReO At TcO Van Sande et al. 2003 Endocrinology 144 247 52 International Patent Publication WO2004000236 . Such substrates can be administered to patients in chemical forms well known in the art for therapeutic or imaging purposes. For example I can be administered as NaI TcO can be administered as Na TcO . In some instances the NIS substrates used in the methods herein and other methods for imaging o therapy are isotopic and include radionuclides. For example I I I and I are forms of isotopic radioactive iodide TcOis a form of isotopic pertechnate ReOis an isotopic form of perrhenate and At is an isotopic form of astatide.

The activity of transporters used in the viruses and methods herein and the ability of the modified viruses to deliver and express these transporters on infected cells can be assayed using methods well known in the art. The ability of transporters to transport one or more substrates can be assessed prior to expression in a modified virus such as by transfection of cell lines with nucleic acid encoding the transporter of interest to assist in determining suitable transporters for inclusion in the modified viruses. The activity of the transporters also can be assessed in the context of a modified virus such as any of those provided herein. The transporters can be assessed for example to determine the expression profile including the cellular localization and level of expression on a cell following infection with the modified virus that expresses the transporter. In addition the ability of virus to produce high levels of expression of the transporter in tumor tissue can be assessed to determine whether the expressed transporter can concentrate the signals emitted by the transporter substrates at the tumor tissue. The specificity of the transporter such as the ability of the transporter to transport one or more substrates and level of activity such as how much substrate is transported can be assessed. Such assays are available and know by those skill in the art. Exemplary assays are provided herein.

The expression of transporters on cells infected by modified viruses carrying those transporters such as those viruses described herein can be assessed using assays well known in the art. In some instances immunoassays can be used to assess the expression of transporters on cells following infection with the modified viruses. For example modified viruses encoding a transporter can be used to infect cells and the level of expression determined by immunoblot with a transporter specific antibody following cell lysis see e.g. Example 2.C below . Alternatively the cell lysates could be analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbant assays ELISA to assess transporter expression. In another example infected cells are analyzed by for example immunohistochemistry flow cytometry analysis or immunoprecipitation using transporter specific antibodies.

Assays to determine the cellular localization of a transporter following infection with a modified virus encoding the transporter also are known in the art and can be used herein. For example techniques such as immunocytochemistry and cell surface biotinylation can be used to determine the localization of transporters such as NET NIS and GABA transporters Gu et al. 2001 Mol. Cell. Biol. 12 3797 3807 Alin et al. 1996 J. Biol. Chem. 27 6917 6924 Gu et al. 1996 J. Biol. Chem. 271 18100 18106 Dayem et al. 2008 J. Endocrinol. 197 95 109 .

The ability of transporters to bind and transport substrates across a membrane can be assessed in vitro using any one or more assays known in the art. In some instances radiotracer assays are used to assess transporter activity such as those described in Example 2.D below. Such assays can be performed prior to introducing the nucleic acid encoding the transporter into the modified viruses. This can be done for example to screen transporters for substrate specificity to assist in determining which transporters are suitable for use in the viruses and methods herein. For example nucleic acid encoding the transporter can be stably or transiently transfected or can be introduced using viral vectors into an appropriate cell line see e.g. Moroz et al. 2007 J Nucl. Med. 48 827 836 and a radiotracer assay performed. Alternatively the modified virus expressing the transporter can be used to infect an appropriate cell line such a tumor cell line such as described in Example 2.D. The amount of radiolabeled substrate that is transported into the cell is then assessed such as by using a gamma counter to determine whether the transporter is specific for the substrate and if so how efficient the transporter is in transporting the substrate. Many radiolabeled substrates are readily available and methods for radiolabeling substrates also are well known in the art and can be used in the methods herein to label a desired substrate for use in a radiotracer assay. Isotopic labels can be incorporated at specific positions of a compound and can be incorporated into peptides and polypeptides and other substances see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 102 651 5 277 893 U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070280883 Sandell et al. 2002 Bior. Med. Clin. Lett. 14 3611 3613 . Such assays can be performed using cells infected with modified viruses encoding the transporter and cells infected with modified viruses that do not encode the transporter. The level by which substrate uptake is increased when the transporter is expressed can then be determined.

Other assays to detect transport of substrates are known in the art and can be used herein. In some instances these assays utilize fluorescent substrates. For example the fluorescent substrate 4 4 dimethylaminostyryl N methylpyridinium ASP can be used to detect transporting activity of NET see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004115703 International Pat. Pub. WO2008043851 Hauns 2007 J. Biomol. Screen. 12 378 384 . Other fluorescent substrates can be used to detect the activity or neurotransmitter transporters International Pat. Pub. WO2008021870 . Fluorescent based assays also are known for other transporters including but not limited to NIS see e.g. Rhoden et al. 2007 Am. J. Physiol. 61 C814 C823 . Other methods for identifying substrates specific for transporters are known in the art and can be used herein see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 309 576 European Patent No EP1212616 .

The modified viruses encoding transporters also can be assessed in vivo both in human and animal models. Animal models such as mouse models of different types of human and non human animal cancers can be employed to assess the transporter activity imparted by infection with the modified viruses. Tumors can be established by implantation of different tumor cell types. Exemplary human tumor xenograft models in mice such as nude or SCID mice include but are not limited to human lung carcinoma A549 cells ATCC No. CCL 185 human breast tumor GI 101A cells Rathinavelu et al. 17 133 146 1999 human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR 3 cells ATCC No. HTB 161 human pancreatic carcinoma PANC lcells ATCC No. CRL 1469 and MIA PaCa 2 cells ATCC No. CRL 1420 DU145 cells human prostate cancer cells ATCC No. HTB 81 human prostate cancer PC 3 cells ATCC CRL 1435 colon carcinoma HT 29 cells human melanoma 888 MEL cells 1858 MEL cells or 1936 MEL cells see e.g. Wang et al. 2006 126 1372 1377 and human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells ATCC No. CCL 121 and human mesothelioma MSTO 211H cells .

The ability of the virus to deliver the transporter to the tumor and for the transporter to be subsequently expressed and be active can be assessed using such models see e.g. Example 3 below . For example transporter expression can be detected using methods such as immunohistochemistry immunoblot and flow cytometry analysis of tumor and non tumor tissues using transporter specific antibodies. The activity of the transporter also be assessed using for example radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled substrate. Whole animal imaging can be then performed such as PET or gamma imaging see e.g. Example 3.B and C below to detect the transport and accumulation of the labeled substrate in the tumor cells. In other examples tissues from the mouse can be extracted and the radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled substrate can be detected by for example imaging flow cytometry gamma counting or fluorescent microscopy.

In some instances the radiolabeled substrate also can be a chemotherapeutic agent or can be linked to a therapeutic agent. Thus the therapeutic effect of transport of the agent into the tumor cell also can be assessed in animal models. For example the change in tumor growth can be assessed following injection with a modified virus encoding a transporter chemotherapeutic agent and compared with tumor growth following injection with a modified virus that does not encode the transporter.

Substrates that can be transported into cells by particular transporter proteins are known in the art and can be selected for use as imaging and or therapeutic agents. The substrates can be radiolabeled for detection in vivo by imaging methods including PET and SPECT imaging and other imaging methods as described elsewhere herein. The radiolabeled substrates can be employed for either or both imaging and therapy of tumors. For example the accumulation of radioactive substrates within infected tumor cells that express the corresponding transporter proteins can provide radiotherapy treatment of the tumor.

Exemplary detectable substrates that can be selected for transport by norepinephrine dopamine and serotonin transporters include but are not limited to radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine MIBG such as I MIBG and I MIBG I MIBG and C labeled hydroxyephedrine HED Shulkin et al. 1986 27 1138 42 and Glowniak et al. 1993 34 1140 6 . Exemplary detectable substrates that can be selected for transport by hNIS include but are not limited to radioactive iodide I I and I other radiolabeled anions TcO pertechnetate Br the emitter rhenium ReO and the emitter astatine At Van Sande et al. 2003 144 247 52 Barton et al. 2003 8 508 18 Kang et al. 2004 45 1571 6 Cho et al. 2002 9 1139 45 Groot Wassink et al. 2004 9 436 42 Niu et al. 2004 45 445 9 Groot Wassink et al. 2002 13 1723 35 Shimura et al. 1997 138 4493 6 Mandell et al. 1999 59 661 8 Boland et al. 2000 60 3484 92 Carlin et al. 2002 29 729 39 Haberkorn et al. 2003 10 774 80 . hNIS can also transport anions such as ClO SCN SeCN NO Br BF IO and BrO that can be labeled according to methods known in the art Van Sande et al. 2003 144 247 52 .

Selected substrates can also be conjugated to cytotoxic agents for therapy tumors. Uptake of the transporter substrates thus permits accumulation of the cytotoxic agent in the infected tumors that express the transporter. The accumulation also results in high levels of the cytotoxic agents in the surrounding tumorous tissue thus promoting uptake of the cytotoxic agents by neighboring tumor cells. Such cytotoxic agents for the therapy of tumor are know in the art and include but are not limited to double chain ricin ricin A chain abrin abrin A chain saporin modeccin modeccin A chain exotoxin toxin toxin heat labile toxin and Diptheria toxin doxorubicin daunomycin 5 fluorouracil methotrexate taxol ricin A colchicine cytochasins monensin ouabain mitoxanthrone vindesine vinblastine vincristine or enterotoxin

Viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein can contain additional modifications. Such modifications can be generated using any known method for modifying a virus. The additional modifications of the virus can be introduced prior to simultaneously with or following modification of the viral genome to introduce DNA encoding the transporter protein. Furthermore viruses provided herein also can be further modified to attenuate the virus. Hence the methods provided herein can be combined with any known method for modifying a virus. Furthermore the methods provided herein can be combined with any known method for modulating the attenuation of a virus. For example such methods include modification of one or more viral genes such as by a point mutation a deletion mutation an interruption by an insertion a substitution or a mutation of the viral gene promoter or enhancer regions.

Viruses provided herein can contain one or more additional heterologous nucleic acid molecules inserted into the genome of the virus. A heterologous nucleic acid molecule can contain an open reading frame or can be a non coding sequence. In some cases the heterologous nucleic acid replaces all or a portion of a viral gene.

Further modifications of the viruses provided can enhance one or more characteristics of the virus. Such characteristics can include but are not limited to attenuated pathogenicity reduced toxicity preferential accumulation in tumor increased ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells increased immunogenicity increased or decreased replication competence and ability to express additional exogenous proteins and combinations thereof. In some examples the modified viruses have an ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells without aggressively killing the tumor cells. In other examples the viruses can be modified to express one or more detectable gene products including additional gene products that can be used for imaging. In other examples the viruses can be modified to express one or more genes for the therapy of a tumor or an inflamed or wounded tissue. In other examples the viruses can be modified to express one or more genes for harvesting the gene products and or for harvesting antibodies against the gene products.

Methods for modifying a virus include modifications in one or more viral genes. Modification can include those that inactivate viral gene or abolish or decrease the activity of a viral gene product. In some example the viral gene is replaced with non coding nucleic acid. Such modifications in a viral gene can alter the viral processes such as for example viral infectivity viral DNA replication viral protein synthesis virus particle assembly and maturation and viral particle release. Exemplary viral genes for modification include but are not limited to viral surface antigens e.g. proteins that mediate viral attachment to host cell receptors viral proteases and viral enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription of viral genes e.g. polymerases replicases and helicases . Modifications in such genes can decrease the overall replication of the virus and production of viral particles thus resulting in a more attenuated virus.

In some examples the viral gene can be replaced with homologous gene from another virus or a different gene. For example vaccinia viruses provided herein can be modified by replacement of the A34R gene with another A34R gene from a different strain in order to increase the EEV form of the virus. In one example the A34R gene from the Lister strain of vaccinia can be replaced with A34R gene from the IHD J strain of vaccinia virus

In another embodiment a viral surface antigen gene can be modified to produce a chimeric protein such that the heterologous epitope is expressed on the surface of the virus. Viruses expressing such chimeric proteins are thus useful as vaccines for use in generating an immune response in the host subject. Exemplary epitopes include but are not limited to tumor antigens viral and bacterial antigens. Many exemplary antigens are known in the art and include for example those listed and or described in Novellino et al. 2005 54 3 187 207 Eisenberger et al. 2006 20 3 661 87. In one embodiment insertion of a heterologous epitope into the viral gene can affect the level of attenuation of the virus. In an alternative embodiment the level of attenuation of the virus is unaffected by insertion of a heterologous epitope into the viral gene.

Viruses provided herein and viruses generated using the methods provided herein can be further modified to express one or more additional heterologous genes. Gene expression can include expression of a protein encoded by a gene and or expression of an RNA molecule encoded by a gene. In some embodiments the viruses can express heterologous genes at levels high enough that permit harvesting products of the heterologous gene from the tumor.

The heterologous nucleic acid can be operably linked to a promoter for expression of an open reading frame encoding the heterologous protein. Expression of heterologous genes can be controlled by a constitutive promoter or by an inducible promoter. Expression can also be influenced by one or more proteins or RNA molecules expressed by the virus. Gene regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers possess cell type specific activities and can be activated by certain induction factors e.g. hormones growth factors cytokines cytostatics irradiation heat shock via responsive elements. A controlled and restricted expression of these genes can be achieved using such regulatory elements as internal promoters to drive the expression of therapeutic genes in viral vector constructs. Heterologous genes expressed can include genes encoding a therapeutic gene product genes encoding a detectable gene product such as a gene product that can be used for imaging genes encoding a gene product to be harvested genes encoding an antigen of an antibody to be harvested or to elicit an immune response. The viruses provided herein can be used for expressing genes in vivo and in vitro. Exemplary proteins include reporter proteins galactosidase glucuronidase xanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase proteins facilitating detection such as a detectable protein or a protein capable of inducing a detectable signal luciferase fluorescent proteins transferrin receptor for example gene products i.e. proteins and RNAs useful for tumor therapy e.g. a transporter a cell surface receptor a cytokine a chemokine an apoptotic protein a mitosis inhibitor protein an antimitotic oligopeptide an antiangiogenic factor anti cancer antibodies such as a single chain antibody a toxin a tumor antigen a prodrug converting enzyme a ribozyme RNAi siRNA pseudomonas A endotoxin diphtheria toxin p53 Arf Bax tumor necrosis factor alpha HSV TK purine nucleoside phosphorylase angiostatin and endostatin and other anticancer or therapeutic gene products.

Viruses provided herein and viruses generated using the methods provided herein can express one or more genes whose products are detectable or whose products can provide a detectable signal. A variety of detectable gene products such as detectable proteins are known in the art and can be used with the viruses provided herein. Detectable proteins include receptors or other proteins that can specifically bind a detectable compound proteins that can emit a detectable signal such as a fluorescence signal and enzymes that can catalyze a detectable reaction or catalyze formation of a detectable product.

In some embodiments the virus expresses a gene encoding a protein that can emit a detectable signal or that can catalyze a detectable reaction. A variety of DNA sequences encoding proteins that can emit a detectable signal or that can catalyze a detectable reaction such as luminescent or fluorescent proteins are known and can be used in the viruses and methods provided herein. Exemplary genes encoding light emitting proteins include genes from bacterial luciferase from Belas et al. 218 1982 791 793 bacterial luciferase from Foran and Brown 16 1988 177 firefly luciferase de Wet et al. 7 1987 725 737 aequorin from Prasher et al. 26 1987 1326 1332 luciferase from Lorenz et al 88 1991 4438 4442 and green fluorescent protein from Prasher et al. 111 229 233 1987 . The luxA and luxB genes of bacterial luciferase can be fused to produce the fusion gene Fab which can be expressed to produce a fully functional luciferase protein Escher et al. 86 6528 6532 1989 . Transformation and expression of these genes in viruses can permit detection of viral infection for example using a low light and or fluorescence imaging camera. In some embodiments luciferases expressed by viruses can require exogenously added substrates such as decanal or coelenterazine for light emission. In other embodiments viruses can express a complete lux operon which can include proteins that can provide luciferase substrates such as decanal. For example viruses containing the complete lux operon sequence when injected intraperitoneally intramuscularly or intravenously allowed the visualization and localization of microorganisms in live mice indicating that the luciferase light emission can penetrate the tissues and can be detected externally Contag et al. 1995 18 593 603 .

In other embodiments the virus can express a gene that can bind a detectable compound or that can form a product that can bind a detectable compound. A variety of gene products such as proteins that can specifically bind a detectable compound are known in the art including receptors metal binding proteins e.g. siderophores ferritins transferrin receptors ligand binding proteins and antibodies. Any of a variety of detectable compounds can be used and can be imaged by any of a variety of known imaging methods. Exemplary compounds include receptor ligands and antigens for antibodies. The ligand can be labeled according to the imaging method to be used. Exemplary imaging methods include any of X rays a variety magnetic resonance methods such as magnetic resonance imaging MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS and also include any of a variety of tomographic methods including computed tomography CT computed axial tomography CAT electron beam computed tomography EBCT high resolution computed tomography HRCT hypocycloidal tomography positron emission tomography PET single photon emission computed tomography SPECT spiral computed tomography and ultrasonic tomography.

In some examples dual imaging in vitro and or in vivo can be used to detect two or more detectable gene products gene products that produce a detectable signal gene products that can bind a detectable compound or gene products that can bind other molecules to form a detectable product. In some examples the two or more gene products are expressed by different viruses whereas in other examples the two or more gene products are produced by the same virus. For example a virus can express a gene product that emits a detectable signal and also express a gene product that catalyzes a detectable reaction. In other examples a virus can express one or more gene products that emit a detectable signal one or more gene products that catalyze a detectable reaction one or more gene products that can bind a detectable compound or that can form a detectable product or any combination thereof. Any combination of such gene products can be expressed by the viruses provided herein and can be used in combination with any of the methods provided herein. Imaging of such gene products can be performed for example by various imaging methods as described herein and known in the art e.g. fluorescence imaging MRI PET among many other methods of detection . Imaging of gene products can also be performed using the same method whereby gene products are distinguished by their properties such as by differences in wavelengths of light emitted. For example a virus can express more than one fluorescent protein that differs in the wavelength of light emitted e.g. a GFP and an RFP . In another non limiting example an RFP can be expressed with a luciferase. In yet other non limiting examples a fluorescent gene product can be expressed with a gene product such as a ferritin or a transferrin receptor used for magnetic resonance imaging.

For example a fluorescent protein can be expressed as a fusion protein with a luciferase protein.

Viruses provided herein can be modified to express one or more genes whose products cause cell death or whose products cause an anti tumor immune response such genes can be considered therapeutic genes. A variety of therapeutic gene products such as toxic or apoptotic proteins or siRNA are known in the art and can be used with the viruses provided herein. The therapeutic genes can act by directly killing the host cell for example as a channel forming or other lytic protein or by triggering apoptosis or by inhibiting essential cellular processes or by triggering an immune response against the cell or by interacting with a compound that has a similar effect for example by converting a less active compound to a cytotoxic compound. A large number of therapeutic proteins that can be expressed for tumor treatment are known in the art including but not limited to a transporter a cell surface receptor a cytokine a chemokine an apoptotic protein a mitosis inhibitor protein an antimitotic oligopeptide an antiangiogenic factor e.g. hk5 anti cancer antibodies such as a single chain antibody e.g. anti VEGF a toxin a tumor antigen a prodrug converting enzyme a ribozyme RNAi and siRNA.

In another embodiment the therapeutic gene product can be a viral attenuation factor. Antiviral proteins or peptides can be expressed by the viruses provided herein. Expression of antiviral proteins or peptides can control viral pathogenicity. Exemplary viral attenuation factors include but are not limited to virus specific antibodies mucins thrombospondin and soluble proteins such as cytokines including but not limited to TNF interferons for example IFN IFN or IFN and interleukins for example IL 1 IL 12 or IL 18 .

In another embodiment the therapeutic gene product can be a protein ligand such as antitumor oligopeptide. Antitumor oligopeptides are short protein peptides with high affinity and specificity to tumors. Such oligopeptides could be enriched and identified using tumor associated phage libraries Akita et al. 2006 97 10 1075 1081 . These oligopeptides have been shown to enhance chemotherapy U.S. Pat. No. 4 912 199 . The oligopeptides can be expressed by the viruses provided herein. Expression of the oligopeptides can elicit anticancer activities on their own or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. An exemplary group of antitumor oligopeptides is antimitotic peptides including but not limited to tubulysin Khalil et al. 2006 7 4 678 683 phomopsin hemiasterlin taltobulin HTI 286 3 and cryptophycin. Tubulysin is from myxobacteria and can induce depletion of cell microtubules and trigger the apoptotic process. The antimitotic peptides can be expressed by the viruses provide herein and elicit anticancer activities on their own or in combination with other therapeutic modalities.

In another embodiment the therapeutic gene product can be a protein that sequesters molecules or nutrients needed for tumor growth. For example the virus can express one or more proteins that bind iron transport iron or store iron or a combination thereof. Increased iron uptake and or storage by expression of such proteins not only increases contrast for visualization and detection of a tumor or tissue in which the virus accumulates but also depletes iron from the tumor environment. Iron depletion from the tumor environment removes a vital nutrient from the tumors thereby deregulating iron hemostasis in tumor cells and delaying tumor progression and or killing the tumor.

Additionally iron or other labeled metals can be administered to a tumor bearing subject either alone or in a conjugated form. An iron conjugate can include for example iron conjugated to an imaging moiety or a therapeutic agent. In some cases the imaging moiety and therapeutic agent are the same e.g. a radionuclide. Internalization of iron in the tumor wound area of inflammation or infection allows the internalization of iron alone a supplemental imaging moiety or a therapeutic agent which can deliver cytotoxicity specifically to tumor cells or deliver the therapeutic agent for treatment of the wound area of inflammation or infection . These methods can be combined with any of the other methods provided herein.

The viruses provided herein can be modified to express one or more superantigens. Superantigens are antigens that can activate a large immune response often brought about by a large response of T cells.

Since many superantigens also are toxins if expression of a virus of reduced toxicity is desired the superantigen can be modified to retain at least some of its superantigenicity while reducing its toxicity resulting in a compound such as a toxoid. A variety of recombinant superantigens and toxoids of superantigens are known in the art and can readily be expressed in the viruses provided herein. Exemplary toxoids include toxoids of diphtheria toxin as exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 6 455 673 and toxoids of Staphylococcal enterotoxins as exemplified in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 20030009015.

Exemplary genes expressible by a virus provided herein for the purpose of harvesting include human genes. An exemplary list of genes includes the list of human genes and genetic disorders authored and edited by Dr. Victor A. McKusick and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins University and elsewhere and developed for the World Wide Web by NCBI the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man OMIM Center for Medical Genetics Johns Hopkins University Baltimore Md. and National Center for Biotechnology Information National Library of Medicine Bethesda Md. and those available in public databases such as PubMed and GenBank see for example genes provided in the website ncbi.nlm.nih.gov entrez query.fcgi db OMIM .

In one embodiment expression the therapeutic compound can be controlled by a regulatory sequence. Suitable regulatory sequences which for example are functional in a mammalian host cell are well known in the art. In one example the regulatory sequence contains a poxvirus promoter. In another embodiment the regulatory sequence can contain a natural or synthetic vaccinia virus promoter. Strong late promoters can be used to achieve high levels of expression of the foreign genes. Early and intermediate stage promoters can also be used. In one embodiment the promoters contain early and late promoter elements for example the vaccinia virus early late promoter P7.5 k vaccinia late promoter P11k a synthetic early late vaccinia PSEL promoter Patel et al. 1988 85 9431 9435 Davison and Moss 1989 210 749 769 Davison et al. 1990 18 4285 4286 Chakrabarti et al. 1997 23 1094 1097 . As described in the Examples and elsewhere herein the viruses provided can exhibit differences in characteristics such as attenuation as a result of using a stronger promoter versus a weaker promoter. For example in vaccinia synthetic early late and late promoters are relatively strong promoters whereas vaccinia synthetic early P7.5 k early late P7.5 k early and P28 late promoters are relatively weaker promoters see e.g. Chakrabarti et al. 1997 23 6 1094 1097 . Combinations of different promoters can be used to express different gene products in the same virus or two different viruses. In one embodiment different therapeutic or detectable gene products are expressed from different promoters such as two different vaccinia synthetic promoters.

The viruses provided herein can be formed by standard methodologies well known in the art for modifying viruses. Briefly the methods include introducing into viruses one or more genetic modifications followed by screening the viruses for properties reflective of the modification or for other desired properties.

Standard techniques in molecular biology can be used to generate the modified viruses provided herein. Such techniques include various nucleic acid manipulation techniques nucleic acid transfer protocols nucleic acid amplification protocols and other molecular biology techniques known in the art. For example point mutations can be introduced into a gene of interest through the use of oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis. Alternatively homologous recombination can be used to introduce a mutation or exogenous sequence into a target sequence of interest. In an alternative mutagenesis protocol point mutations in a particular gene can also be selected for using a positive selection pressure. See e.g. Current Techniques in Molecular Biology Ed. Ausubel et al. . Nucleic acid amplification protocols include but are not limited to the polymerase chain reaction PCR . Use of nucleic acid tools such as plasmids vectors promoters and other regulating sequences are well known in the art for a large variety of viruses and cellular organisms. Nucleic acid transfer protocols include calcium chloride transformation transfection electroporation liposome mediated nucleic acid transfer N 1 2 3 Dioloyloxy propyl N N N trimethylammonium methylsulfate meditated transformation and others. Further a large variety of nucleic acid tools are available from many different sources including ATCC and various commercial sources. One skilled in the art will be readily able to select the appropriate tools and methods for genetic modifications of any particular virus according to the knowledge in the art and design choice.

Any of a variety of modifications can be readily accomplished using standard molecular biological methods known in the art. The modifications will typically be one or more truncations deletions mutations or insertions of the viral genome. In one embodiment the modification can be specifically directed to a particular sequence. The modifications can be directed to any of a variety of regions of the viral genome including but not limited to a regulatory sequence to a gene encoding sequence or to a sequence without a known role. Any of a variety of regions of viral genomes that are available for modification are readily known in the art for many viruses including the viruses specifically listed herein. As a non limiting example the loci of a variety of vaccinia genes provided herein and elsewhere exemplify the number of different regions that can be targeted for modification in the viruses provided herein. In another embodiment the modification can be fully or partially random whereupon selection of any particular modified virus can be determined according to the desired properties of the modified the virus. These methods include for example in vitro recombination techniques synthetic methods and in vivo recombination methods as described for example in Sambrook et al. 2nd edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 and in the Examples disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the virus can be modified to express an exogenous gene. Exemplary exogenous gene products include proteins and RNA molecules. The modified viruses can express a detectable gene product a therapeutic gene product a gene product for manufacturing or harvesting or an antigenic gene product for antibody harvesting. The characteristics of such gene products are described herein and elsewhere. In some embodiments of modifying an organism to express an exogenous gene the modification can also contain one or more regulatory sequences to regulate expression of the exogenous gene. As is known in the art regulatory sequences can permit constitutive expression of the exogenous gene or can permit inducible expression of the exogenous gene. Further the regulatory sequence can permit control of the level of expression of the exogenous gene. In some examples inducible expression can be under the control of cellular or other factors present in a tumor cell or present in a virus infected tumor cell. In other examples inducible expression can be under the control of an administrable substance including IPTG RU486 or other known induction compounds. Any of a variety of regulatory sequences are available to one skilled in the art according to known factors and design preferences. In some embodiments such as gene product manufacture and harvesting the regulatory sequence can result in constitutive high levels of gene expression. In some embodiments such as anti gene product antibody harvesting the regulatory sequence can result in constitutive lower levels of gene expression. In tumor therapy embodiments a therapeutic protein can be under the control of an internally inducible promoter or an externally inducible promoter.

In other embodiments organ or tissue specific expression can be controlled by regulatory sequences. In order to achieve expression only in the target organ for example a tumor to be treated the foreign nucleotide sequence can be linked to a tissue specific promoter and used for gene therapy. Such promoters are well known to those skilled in the art see e.g. Zimmermann et al. 12 11 24 1994 Vidal et al. 9 833 840 1990 Mayford et al. 81 891 904 1995 and Pinkert et al. 1 268 76 1987 .

In some embodiments the viruses can be modified to express two or more proteins where any combination of the two or more proteins can be one or more detectable gene products therapeutic gene products gene products for manufacturing or harvesting or antigenic gene products for antibody harvesting. In one embodiment a virus can be modified to express a detectable protein and a therapeutic protein. In another embodiment a virus can be modified to express two or more gene products for detection or two or more therapeutic gene products. For example one or more proteins involved in biosynthesis of a luciferase substrate can be expressed along with luciferase. When two or more exogenous genes are introduced the genes can be regulated under the same or different regulatory sequences and the genes can be inserted in the same or different regions of the viral genome in a single or a plurality of genetic manipulation steps. In some embodiments one gene such as a gene encoding a detectable gene product can be under the control of a constitutive promoter while a second gene such as a gene encoding a therapeutic gene product can be under the control of an inducible promoter. Methods for inserting two or more genes in to a virus are known in the art and can be readily performed for a wide variety of viruses using a wide variety of exogenous genes regulatory sequences and or other nucleic acid sequences.

Methods of producing recombinant viruses are known in the art. Provided herein for exemplary purposes are methods of producing a recombinant vaccinia virus. A recombinant vaccinia virus with an insertion in the F14.5L gene NotI site of LIVP can be prepared by the following steps a generating i a vaccinia shuttle plasmid containing the modified F14.5L gene inserted at restriction site X and ii a dephosphorylated wt VV VGL DNA digested at restriction site X b transfecting host cells infected with PUV inactivated helper VV VGL with a mixture of the constructs of i and ii of step a and c isolating the recombinant vaccinia viruses from the transfectants. One skilled in the art knows how to perform such methods for example by following the instructions given in co pending U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10 872 156 and 11 238 025 see also Timiryasova et al. 31 534 540 2001 . In one embodiment restriction site X is a unique restriction site. A variety of suitable host cells also are known to the person skilled in the art and include many mammalian avian and insect cells and tissues which are susceptible for vaccinia virus infection including chicken embryo rabbit hamster and monkey kidney cells for example HeLa cells RK CV 1 Vero BSC40 and BSC 1 monkey kidney cells.

Modified viruses can be screened for any desired characteristics including the characteristics described herein such as attenuated pathogenicity reduced toxicity preferential accumulation in tumor increased ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells increased immunogenicity increased or decreased replication competence and are able to express exogenous proteins and combinations thereof. For example the modified viruses can be screened for the ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells without aggressively killing the tumor cells. In another example the viruses can be screened for expression of one or more detectable genes including genes that can be used for imaging or for expression of one or more genes for manufacture or harvest of the gene products and or for harvest of antibodies against the gene products.

Any of a variety of known methods for screening for such characteristics can be performed as demonstrated in the Examples provided herein. One exemplary method for screening for desired characteristics includes but is not limited to monitoring growth replication and or gene expression including expression of an exogenous gene in cell culture or other in vitro medium. The cell culture can be from any organism and from any tissue source and can include tumorous tissues. Other exemplary methods for screening for desired characteristics include but are not limited to administering a virus to animal including non human animals such as a mouse monkey or ape and optionally also including humans and monitoring the virus the tumor and or the animal monitoring can be performed by in vivo imaging of the virus and or the tumor e.g. low light imaging of viral gene expression or ultrasonic tumor imaging external monitoring of the tumor e.g. external measurement of tumor size monitoring the animal e.g. monitoring animal weight blood panel antibody titer spleen size or liver size . Other exemplary methods for screening for desired characteristics include but are not limited to harvesting a non human animal for the effects and location of the virus and expression by the virus including methods such as harvesting a variety of organs including a tumor to determine presence of the virus and or gene expression by the virus in the organs or tumor harvesting of organs associated with an immune response or viral clearance such as the spleen or liver harvesting the tumor to determine tumor size and viability of tumor cells harvesting antibodies or antibody producing cells. Such screening and monitoring methods can be used in any of a variety of combinations as is known in art. In one embodiment a virus can be screened by administering the virus to an animal such as a non human animal or a human followed by monitoring by in vivo imaging. In another embodiment a virus can be screened by administering the virus to an animal such as a non human animal monitoring by in vivo imaging and then harvesting the animal. Thus provided herein are methods for screening a virus for desired characteristics by administering the virus to an animal such as an animal with a tumor and monitoring the animal tumor if present and or virus in the animal for one or more characteristics. Also provided herein are methods for screening a virus for desired characteristics by administering the virus to a non human animal such as a non human animal with a tumor harvesting the animal and assaying the animal s organs antibody titer and or tumor if present for one or more characteristics.

Provided herein are methods for screening a virus for attenuated pathogenicity or reduced toxicity where the pathogenicity or toxicity can be determined by a variety of techniques including but not limited to assessing the health state of the subject measuring the body weight of a subject blood or urine analysis of a subject and monitoring tissue distribution of the virus within the subject such techniques can be performed on a living subject in vivo or can be performed post mortem. Methods also can include the ability of the viruses to lyse cells or cause cell death which can be determined in vivo or in vitro.

When a subject drops below a threshold body weight the virus can be considered pathogenic to the subject. Exemplary thresholds can be a drop of about 5 or more a drop of about 10 or more or a drop of about 15 or more in body weight relative to a reference. A body weight reference can be selected from any of a variety of references used in the art for example a body weight reference can be the weight of the subject prior to administration of the virus the body weight reference can be a control subject having the same condition as the test subject e.g. normal or tumor injected where the change in weight of the control is compared to the change in weight of the test subject for the time period after administration of the virus.

Blood or urine analysis of the subject can indicate level of immune response level of toxins in the subject or other levels of stress to cells tissues or organs of the subject such as kidneys pancreas liver and spleen. Levels increased above established threshold levels can indicate pathogenicity of the virus to the subject. Threshold levels of components of blood or urine for indicating viral pathogenicity are well known in the art and any such thresholds can be selected herein according to the desired tolerance of pathogenicity or toxicity of the virus.

Tissue distribution of a virus in a subject can indicate pathogenicity or toxicity of the virus. In one embodiment tissue distribution of a virus that is not pathogenic or toxic can be mostly in tumor relative to other tissues or organs. Microorganisms located mostly in tumor can accumulate for example at least about 2 fold greater at least about 5 fold greater at least about 10 fold greater at least about 100 fold greater at least about 1 000 fold greater at least about 10 000 fold greater at least about 100 000 fold greater or at least about 1 000 000 fold greater than the viruses accumulate in any other particular organ or tissue.

Provided herein are methods for screening a virus for tissue distribution or accumulation where the tissue distribution can be determined by a variety of techniques including but not limited to harvesting a non human subject in vivo imaging a detectable gene product in subject. Harvesting can be accomplished by euthanizing the non human subject and determining the accumulation of viruses in tumor and optionally the accumulation in one or more additional tissues or organs. The accumulation can be determined by any of a variety of methods including but not limited to detecting gene products such as detectable gene products e.g. GFP or beta galactosidase histological or microscopic evaluation of tissue organ or tumor samples or measuring the number of plaque or colony forming units present in a tissue organ or tumor sample. In one embodiment the desired amount of tissue distribution of a virus can be mostly in tumor relative to other tissues or organs. Microorganisms located mostly in tumor can accumulate for example at least about 2 fold greater at least about 5 fold greater at least about 10 fold greater at least about 100 fold greater at least about 1 000 fold greater at least about 10 000 fold greater at least about 100 000 fold greater or at least about 1 000 000 fold greater than the viruses accumulate in any other particular organ or tissue.

Also provided herein are methods of screening for viruses that can elicit an immune response where the immune response can be against the tumor cells or against the viruses. A variety of methods for measuring the ability to elicit an immune response are known in the art and include measuring an overall increase in immune activity in a subject measuring an increase in anti virus or anti tumor antibodies in a subject testing the ability of a virus treated typically a non human subject to prevent later infection tumor formation or to rapidly eliminate viruses or tumor cells. Methods also can include the ability of the viruses to lyse cells or cause cell death which can be determined in vivo or in vitro.

Also provided herein are methods for determining increased or decreased replication competence by monitoring the speed of replication of the viruses. Such measurements can be performed in vivo or in vitro. For example the speed of replication in a cell culture can be used to determine replication competence of a virus. In another example the speed of replication in a tissue organ or tumor in a subject can be used to measure replication competence. In some embodiments decreased replication competence in non tumor tissues and organs can be the characteristic to be selected in a screen. In other embodiments increased replication competence in tumors can be the characteristic to be selected in a screen.

Also provided herein are methods for determining the ability of a virus to express genes such as exogenous gene. Such methods can be performed in vivo or in vitro. For example the viruses can be screened on selective plates for the ability to express a gene that permits survival of the virus or permits the virus to provide a detectable signal such as turning X gal blue. Such methods also can be performed in vivo where expression can be determined for example by harvesting tissues organs or tumors a non human subject or by in vivo imaging of a subject.

Also provided herein are methods for determining the ability of a virus to express genes toward which the subject can develop antibodies including exogenous genes toward which the subject can develop antibodies. Such methods can be performed in vivo using any of a variety of non human subjects. For example gene expression can be determined for example by bleeding a non human subject to which a virus has been administered and assaying the blood or serum for the presence of antibodies against the virus expressed gene or by any other method generally used for polyclonal antibody harvesting such as production bleeds and terminal bleeds.

Also provided herein are methods for screening a virus that has two or more characteristics provided herein including screening for attenuated pathogenicity reduced toxicity preferential accumulation in tumor increased ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells increased immunogenicity increased or decreased replication competence ability to express exogenous proteins and ability to elicit antibody production against a virally expressed gene product. A single monitoring technique such as in vivo imaging can be used to verify two or more characteristics or a variety of different monitoring techniques can be used as can be determined by one skilled in the art according to the selected characteristics and according to the monitoring techniques used.

Mouse models of different types of human and non human animal cancers can be employed to assess the properties of the modified viruses. Tumors can be established by implantation of different tumor cell types. Exemplary human tumor xenograft models in mice include but are not limited to human lung carcinoma A549 cells ATCC No. CCL 185 human breast tumor G1 101A cells Rathinavelu et al. 17 133 146 1999 human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR 3 cells ATCC No. HTB 161 human pancreatic carcinoma PANC lcells ATCC No. CRL 1469 and MIA PaCa 2 cells ATCC No. CRL 1420 DU145 cells human prostate cancer cells ATCC No. HTB 81 human prostate cancer PC 3 cells ATCC CRL 1435 colon carcinoma HT 29 cells human melanoma 888 MEL cells 1858 MEL cells or 1936 MEL cells see e.g. Wang et al. 2006 126 1372 1377 and human fibrosarcoma HT 1080 cells ATCC No. CCL 121 .

The viruses provided herein can accumulate in immunoprivileged cells or immunoprivileged tissues including tumors and or metastases and also including wounded tissues and cells. While the viruses provided herein can typically be cleared from the subject to whom the viruses are administered by activity of the subject s immune system viruses can nevertheless accumulate survive and proliferate in immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumors because such immunoprivileged areas are sequestered from the host s immune system. Accordingly the methods provided herein as applied to tumors and or metastases and therapeutic methods relating thereto can readily be applied to other immunoprivileged cells and tissues including wounded cells and tissues.

The viruses provided herein and viruses provided for use in the methods are typically attenuated. Attenuated viruses have a decreased capacity to cause disease in a host. The decreased capacity can result from any of a variety of different modifications to the ability of a virus to be pathogenic. For example a virus can have reduced toxicity reduced ability to accumulate in non tumorous organs or tissue reduced ability to cause cell lysis or cell death or reduced ability to replicate compared to the non attenuated form thereof. The attenuated viruses provided herein however retain at least some capacity to replicate and to cause immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells to leak or lyse undergo cell death or otherwise cause or enhance an immune response to immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells.

Viruses can be toxic to their hosts by manufacturing one or more compounds that worsen the health condition of the host. Toxicity to the host can be manifested in any of a variety of manners including septic shock neurological effects or muscular effects. The viruses provided herein can have a reduced toxicity to the host. The reduced toxicity of a virus of the present methods and compositions can range from a toxicity in which the host experiences no toxic effects to a toxicity in which the host does not typically die from the toxic effects of the microbes. In some embodiments the viruses are of a reduced toxicity such that a host typically has no significant long term effect from the presence of the viruses in the host beyond any effect on tumorous metastatic or necrotic organs or tissues. For example the reduced toxicity can be a minor fever or minor infection which lasts for less than about a month and following the fever or infection the host experiences no adverse effects resultant from the fever or infection. In another example the reduced toxicity can be measured as an unintentional decline in body weight of about 5 or less for the host after administration of the microbes. In other examples the virus has no toxicity to the host.

Viruses can accumulate in any of a variety of tissues and organs of the host. Accumulation can be evenly distributed over the entire host organism or can be concentrated in one or a few organs or tissues. The viruses provided herein can accumulate in targeted tissues such as immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumors and also metastases. In some embodiments the viruses provided herein exhibit accumulation in immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells relative to normal organs or tissues that is equal to or greater than the accumulation that occurs with wild type viruses. In other embodiments the viruses provided herein exhibit accumulation in immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells that is equal to or greater than the accumulation in any other particular organ or tissue. For example the viruses provided herein can demonstrate an accumulation in immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells that is at least about 2 fold greater at least about 5 fold greater at least about 10 fold greater at least about 100 fold greater at least about 1 000 fold greater at least about 10 000 fold greater at least about 100 000 fold greater or at least about 1 000 000 fold greater than the accumulation in any other particular organ or tissue.

In some embodiments a virus can accumulate in targeted tissues and cells such as immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells without accumulating in one or more selected tissues or organs. For example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in the brain. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in neural cells. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in ovaries. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in the blood. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in the heart. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in the bladder. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in testes. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in the spleen. In another example a virus can accumulate in tumor cells without accumulating in the lungs.

One skilled in the art can determine the desired capability for the viruses to selectively accumulate in targeted tissue or cells such as in an immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor rather than non target organs or tissues according to a variety of factors known in the art including but not limited to toxicity of the viruses dosage tumor to be treated immunocompetence of host and disease state of the host.

Viruses herein can cause or enhance an immune response to antigens in the targeted tissues or cells such as immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumor cells. The immune response can be triggered by any of a variety of mechanisms including the presence or expression of immunostimulatory cytokines and the expression or release antigenic compounds that can cause an immune response.

Cells in response to an infection such as a viral infection can send out signals to stimulate an immune response against the cells. Exemplary signals sent from such cells include antigens cytokines and chemokines such as interferon gamma and interleukin 15. The viruses provided herein can cause targeted cells to send out such signals in response to infection by the microbes resulting in a stimulation of the host s immune system against the targeted cells or tissues such as tumor cells.

In another embodiment targeted cells or tissues such as tumor cells can contain one or more compounds that can be recognized by the host s immune system in mounting an immune response against a tumor. Such antigenic compounds can be compounds on the cell surface or the tumor cell and can be protein carbohydrate lipid nucleic acid or combinations thereof. Viral mediated release of antigenic compounds can result in triggering the host s immune system to mount an immune response against the tumor. The amount of antigenic compound released by the tumor cells is any amount sufficient to trigger an immune response in a subject for example the antigenic compounds released from one or more tumor cells can trigger a host immune response in the organism that is known to be accessible to leukocytes.

The time duration of antigen release is an amount of time sufficient for the host to establish an immune response to one or more tumor antigens. In some embodiments the duration is an amount of time sufficient for the host to establish a sustained immune response to one or more tumor antigens. One skilled in the art can determine such a time duration based on a variety of factors affecting the time duration for a subject to develop an immune response including the level of the tumor antigen in the subject the number of different tumor antigens the antigenicity of the antigen the immunocompetence of the host and the access of the antigenic material to the vasculature of the host. Typically the duration of antigen release can be at least about a week at least about 10 days at least about two weeks or at least about a month.

The viruses provided herein can have any of a variety of properties that can cause target cells and tissues such as tumor cells to release antigenic compounds. Exemplary properties are the ability to lyse cells and the ability to elicit apoptosis in tumor cells. Viruses that are unable to lyse tumor cells or cause tumor cell death can nevertheless be used in the methods provided herein when such viruses can cause some release or display of antigenic compounds from tumor cells. A variety of mechanisms for antigen release or display without lysis or cell death are known in the art and any such mechanism can be used by the viruses provided herein including but not limited to secretion of antigenic compounds enhanced cell membrane permeability expression of immunostimulatory proteins or altered cell surface expression or altered MHC presentation in tumor cells when the tumor cells can be accessed by the host s immune system. Regardless of the mechanism by which the host s immune system is activated the net result of the presence of the viruses in the tumor is a stimulation of the host s immune system at least in part against the tumor cells. In one example the viruses can cause an immune response against tumor cells not infected by the viruses.

In one embodiment the viruses provided herein can cause tumor cells to release an antigen that is not present on the tumor cell surface. Tumor cells can produce compounds such as proteins that can cause an immune response however in circumstances in which the antigenic compound is not on the tumor cell surface the tumor can proliferate and even metastasize without the antigenic compound causing an immune response. Within the scope of the present methods the viruses provided herein can cause antigenic compounds within the cell to release away from the cell and away from the tumor which can result in triggering an immune response to such an antigen. Even if not all cells of a tumor are releasing antigens the immune response can initially be targeted toward the leaky tumor cells and the bystander effect of the immune response can result in further tumor cell death around the leaky tumor cells.

Typical methods of involving treatment of targeted cells and tissues such as immunoprivileged cells and tissues such as tumors are designed to cause rapid and complete removal thereof. For example many viruses can cause lysis and or apoptosis in a variety of cells including tumor cells. Viruses that can vigorously lyse or cause cell death can be highly pathogenic and can even kill the host. Furthermore therapeutic methods based upon such rapid and complete lysis are typically therapeutically ineffective.

In contrast the viruses provided herein are not aggressive in causing cell death or lysis. They can have a limited or no ability to cause cell death as long as they accumulate in the target cells or tissues and result in alteration of cell membranes to cause leakage of antigens against which an immune response is mounted. It is desirable that their apoptotic or lytic effect is sufficiently slow or ineffective to permit sufficient antigenic leakage for a sufficient time for the host to mount an effective immune response against the target tissues. Such immune response alone or in combination with the lytic apoptotic effect of the virus results in elimination of the target tissue and also elimination of future development such as metastases and reoccurrence of such tissues or cells. While the viruses provided herein can have a limited ability to cause cell death the viruses provided herein can nevertheless stimulate the host s immune system to attack tumor cells. As a result such viruses also are typically unlikely to have substantial toxicity to the host.

In one embodiment the viruses have a limited or no ability to cause tumor cell death while still causing or enhancing an immune response against tumor cells. In one example the rate of viral mediated tumor cell death is less than the rate of tumor cell growth or replication. In another example the rate of viral mediated tumor cell death is slow enough for the host to establish a sustained immune response to one or more tumor antigens. Typically the time for cell death is sufficient to establish an anti tumor immune response and can be at least about a week at least about 10 days at least about two weeks or at least about a month depending upon the host and the targeted cells or tissues.

In another embodiment the viruses provided herein can cause cell death in tumor cells without causing substantial cell death in non tumor tissues. In such an embodiment the viruses can aggressively kill tumor cells as long as no substantial cell death occurs in non tumor cells and optionally so long as the host has sufficient capability to mount an immune response against the tumor cells.

In one embodiment the ability of the viruses to cause cell death is slower than the host s immune response against the viruses. The ability for the host to control infection by the viruses can be determined by the immune response e.g. antibody titer against viral antigens. Typically after the host has mounted immune response against the viruses the viruses can have reduced pathogenicity in the host. Thus when the ability of the viruses to cause cell death is slower than the host s immune response against the microbes viral mediated cell death can occur without risk of serious disease or death to the host. In one example the ability of the viruses to cause tumor cell death is slower than the host s immune response against the microbes.

The viruses provided herein also can be immunogenic. An immunogenic virus can create a host immune response against the virus. In one embodiment the viruses can be sufficiently immunogenic to result in a large anti viral antibody titer. The viruses provided herein can have the ability to elicit an immune response. The immune response can be activated in response to viral antigens or can be activated as a result of viral infection induced cytokine or chemokine production. Immune response against the viruses can decrease the likelihood of pathogenicity toward the host organism.

Immune response against the viruses also can result in target tissue or cell such as tumor cell killing. In one embodiment the immune response against viral infection can result in an immune response against tumor cells including developing antibodies against tumor antigens. In one example an immune response mounted against the virus can result in tumor cell killing by the bystander effect where uninfected tumor cells nearby infected tumor cells are killed at the same time as infected cells or alternatively where uninfected tumor cells nearby extracellular viruses are killed at the same time as the viruses. As a result of bystander effect tumor cell death tumor cell antigens can be released from cells and the host organism s immune system can mount an immune response against tumor cell antigens resulting in an immune response against the tumor itself.

In one embodiment the virus can be selected or modified to express one or more antigenic compounds including superantigenic compounds. The antigenic compounds such as superantigens can be endogenous gene products or can be exogenous gene products. Superantigens including toxoids are known in the art and described elsewhere herein.

The viruses provided herein can be replication competent. In a variety of viral systems the administered virus is rendered replication incompetent to limit pathogenicity risk to the host. While replication incompetence can protect the host from the virus it also limits the ability of the virus to infect and kill tumor cells and typically results in only a short lived effect. In contrast the viruses provided herein can be attenuated but replication competent resulting in low toxicity to the host and accumulation mainly or solely in tumors. Thus the viruses provided herein can be replication competent without creating a pathogenicity risk to the host.

Attenuation of the viruses provided herein can include but is not limited to reducing the replication competence of the virus. For example a virus can be modified to decrease or eliminate an activity related to replication such as a transcriptional activator that regulates replication in the virus. In an example a virus can have the viral thymidine kinase TK gene modified which decreases replication of the virus.

The viruses provided herein can be modified from their wild type form. Modifications can include any of a variety of changes and typically include changes to the genome or nucleic acid molecules of the viruses. Exemplary nucleic acid molecular modifications include truncations insertions deletions and mutations. In an exemplary modification a viral gene can be modified by truncation insertion deletion or mutation. In an exemplary insertion an exogenous gene can be inserted into the genome of the virus.

Modifications of the viruses provided herein can result in a modification of viral characteristics including those provided herein such as pathogenicity toxicity ability to preferentially accumulate in tumor ability to lyse cells or cause cell death ability to elicit an immune response against tumor cells immunogenicity and replication competence. Variants can be obtained by general methods such as mutagenesis and passage in cell or tissue culture and selection of desired properties as is known in the art as exemplified for respiratory syncytial virus in Murphy et al. 1994 32 13 26.

Variants also can be obtained by mutagenic methods in which nucleic acid residues of the virus are added removed or modified relative to the wild type. Any of a variety of known mutagenic methods can be used including recombination based methods restriction endonuclease based methods and PCR based methods. Mutagenic methods can be directed against particular nucleotide sequences such as genes or can be random where selection methods based on desired characteristics can be used to select mutated viruses. Any of a variety of viral modifications can be made according to the selected virus and the particular known modifications of the selected virus.

In some exemplary methods the virus can be present in the tumor and can cause an anti tumor immune response without the virus itself causing enough tumor cell death to prevent tumor growth. In some examples the tumor is a monotherapeutic tumor or monotherapeutic cancer where the tumor or cancer does not decrease in volume when treated with the virus or a therapeutic agent alone.

In some examples provided herein are methods for eliciting or enhancing antibody production against a selected antigen or a selected antigen type in a subject where the methods include administering to a subject a virus that can accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and can cause release of a selected antigen or selected antigen type from the tumor resulting in antibody production against the selected antigen or selected antigen type. Any of a variety of antigens can be targeted in the methods provided herein including a selected antigen such as an exogenous gene product expressed by the virus or a selected antigen type such as one or more tumor antigens release from the tumor as a result of viral infection of the tumor e.g. by lysis apoptosis secretion or other mechanism of causing antigen release from the tumor .

In some embodiments it can be desirable to maintain release of the selected antigen or selected antigen type over a series of days for example at least a week at least ten days at least two weeks or at least a month. Provided herein are methods for providing a sustained antigen release within a subject where the methods include administering to a subject a virus that can accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and can cause sustained release of an antigen resulting in antibody production against the antigen. The sustained release of antigen can result in an immune response by the viral infected host in which the host can develop antibodies against the antigen and or the host can mount an immune response against cells expressing the antigen including an immune response against tumor cells. Thus the sustained release of antigen can result in immunization against tumor cells. In some embodiments the viral mediated sustained antigen release induced immune response against tumor cells can result in complete removal or killing of all tumor cells.

In some embodiments the therapeutic methods provided herein inhibit tumor growth in a subject where the methods include administering to a subject a virus that can accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response. The anti tumor immune response induced as a result of tumor or metastases accumulated viruses can result in inhibition of tumor growth.

In some embodiments the therapeutic methods provided herein inhibit growth or formation of a metastasis in a subject where the methods include administering to a subject a virus provided herein that can accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response. The anti tumor immune response induced as a result of tumor or metastasis accumulated viruses can result in inhibition of metastasis growth or formation.

In other embodiments the therapeutic methods provided herein decrease the size of a tumor and or metastasis in a subject where the methods include administering to a subject a virus provided herein that can accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response. The anti tumor immune response induced as a result of tumor or metastasis accumulated viruses can result in a decrease in the size of the tumor and or metastasis.

In some embodiments the therapeutic methods provided herein eliminate a tumor and or metastasis from a subject where the methods include administering to a subject a virus provided herein that can accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response. The anti tumor immune response induced as a result of tumor or metastasis accumulated viruses can result in elimination of the tumor and or metastasis from the subject.

Methods of reducing or inhibiting tumor growth inhibiting metastasis growth and or formation decreasing the size of a tumor or metastasis eliminating a tumor or metastasis or other tumor therapeutic methods provided herein include causing or enhancing an anti tumor immune response in the host. The immune response of the host being anti tumor in nature can be mounted against tumors and or metastases in which viruses have accumulated and can also be mounted against tumors and or metastases in which viruses have not accumulated including tumors and or metastases that form after administration of the virus to the subject. Accordingly a tumor and or metastasis whose growth or formation is inhibited or whose size is decreased or that is eliminated can be a tumor and or metastasis in which the viruses have accumulated or also can be a tumor and or metastasis in which the viruses have not accumulated. Accordingly provided herein are methods of reducing or inhibiting tumor growth inhibiting metastasis growth and or formation decreasing the size of a tumor or metastasis eliminating a tumor or metastasis or other tumor therapeutic methods where the method includes administering to a subject a virus provided herein where the virus accumulates in at least one tumor or metastasis and causes or enhances an anti tumor immune response in the subject and the immune response also is mounted against a tumor and or metastasis in which the virus cell did not accumulate. In another embodiment methods are provided for inhibiting or preventing recurrence of a neoplastic disease or inhibiting or preventing new tumor growth where the methods include administering to a subject a virus provided herein that can accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response and the anti tumor immune response can inhibit or prevent recurrence of a neoplastic disease or inhibit or prevent new tumor growth.

The tumor or neoplastic disease therapeutic methods provided herein such as methods of reducing or inhibiting tumor growth inhibiting metastasis growth and or formation decreasing the size of a tumor or metastasis eliminating a tumor or metastasis or other tumor therapeutic methods also can include administering to a subject a virus provided herein that can cause tumor cell lysis or tumor cell death. Such a virus can be the same virus as the virus that can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response in the subject. Viruses such as the viruses provided herein can cause cell lysis or tumor cell death as a result of expression of an endogenous gene or as a result of an exogenous gene. Endogenous or exogenous genes can cause tumor cell lysis or inhibit cell growth as a result of direct or indirect actions as is known in the art including lytic channel formation or activation of an apoptotic pathway. Gene products such as exogenous gene products can function to activate a prodrug to an active cytotoxic form resulting in cell death where such genes are expressed.

Such methods of antigen production or tumor and or metastasis treatment can include administration of a virus provided herein for therapy such as for gene therapy for cancer gene therapy or for vaccine therapy. Such a virus can be used to stimulate humoral and or cellular immune response induce strong cytotoxic T lymphocytes responses in subjects who can benefit from such responses. For example the virus can provide prophylactic and therapeutic effects against a tumor infected by the virus or other infectious diseases by rejection of cells from tumors or lesions using viruses that express immunoreactive antigens Earl et al. 234 728 831 1986 Lathe et al. London 32 878 880 1987 cellular tumor associated antigens Bernards et al. 84 6854 6858 1987 Estin et al. 85 1052 1056 1988 Kantor et al. 84 1084 1091 1992 Roth et al. 93 4781 4786 1996 and or cytokines e.g. IL 2 IL 12 costimulatory molecules B7 1 B7 2 Rao et al. 156 3357 3365 1996 Chamberlain et al. 56 2832 2836 1996 Oertli et al. 77 3121 3125 1996 Qin and Chatterjee 7 1853 1860 1996 McAneny et al. 3 495 500 1996 or other therapeutic proteins.

As shown previously solid tumors can be treated with viruses such as vaccinia viruses resulting in an enormous tumor specific virus replication which can lead to tumor protein antigen and viral protein production in the tumors U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0031643 . Vaccinia virus administration to mice resulted in lysis of the infected tumor cells and a resultant release of tumor cell specific antigens. Continuous leakage of these antigens into the body led to a very high level of antibody titer in approximately 7 14 days against tumor proteins viral proteins and the virus encoded engineered proteins in the mice. The newly synthesized anti tumor antibodies and the enhanced macrophage neutrophils count were continuously delivered via the vasculature to the tumor and thereby provided for the recruitment of an activated immune system against the tumor. The activated immune system then eliminated the foreign compounds of the tumor including the viral particles. This interconnected release of foreign antigens boosted antibody production and continuous response of the antibodies against the tumor proteins to function like an autoimmunizing vaccination system initiated by vaccinia viral infection and replication followed by cell lysis protein leakage and enhanced antibody production. Thus the viruses provided herein and the viruses generated using the methods provided herein can be administered in a complete process that can be applied to all tumor systems with immunoprivileged tumor sites as site of privileged viral growth which can lead to tumor elimination by the host s own immune system.

In other embodiments methods are provided for immunizing a subject where the methods include administering to the subject a virus that expresses one or more antigens against which antigens the subject will develop an immune response. The immunizing antigens can be endogenous to the virus such as vaccinia antigens on a vaccinia virus used to immunize against smallpox measles mumps or the immunizing antigens can be exogenous antigens expressed by the virus such as influenza or HIV antigens expressed on a viral capsid surface. In the case of smallpox for example a tumor specific protein antigen can be carried by an attenuated vaccinia virus encoded by the viral genome for a smallpox vaccine. Thus the viruses provided herein including the modified vaccinia viruses can be used as vaccines.

In one embodiment the tumor treated is a cancer such as pancreatic cancer non small cell lung cancer multiple myeloma or leukemia although the cancer is not limited in this respect and other metastatic diseases can be treated by the combinations provided herein. For example the tumor treated can be a solid tumor such as of the lung and bronchus breast colon and rectum kidney stomach esophagus liver and intrahepatic bile duct urinary bladder brain and other nervous system head and neck oral cavity and pharynx cervix uterine corpus thyroid ovary testes prostate malignant melanoma cholangiocarcinoma thymoma non melanoma skin cancers as well as hematologic tumors and or malignancies such as childhood leukemia and lymphomas multiple myeloma Hodgkin s disease lymphomas of lymphocytic and cutaneous origin acute and chronic leukemia such as acute lymphoblastic acute myelocytic or chronic myelocytic leukemia plasma cell neoplasm lymphoid neoplasm and cancers associated with AIDS. Exemplary tumors include for example pancreatic tumors ovarian tumors lung tumors colon tumors prostate tumors cervical tumors and breast tumors. In one embodiment the tumor is a carcinoma such as for example an ovarian tumor or a pancreatic tumor.

In performing the therapeutic methods provided herein a virus provided herein that encodes a transporter protein can be administered to a subject including a subject having a tumor or having neoplastic cells or a subject to be immunized. An administered virus can be a virus provided herein or any other virus generated using the methods provided herein. In some embodiments the virus administered is a virus containing a characteristic such as attenuated pathogenicity low toxicity preferential accumulation in tumor ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells high immunogenicity replication competence and ability to express exogenous proteins and combinations thereof. A substrate that is transported by the transporter protein can be administered simultaneously or sequentially to administration of the virus for detection imaging or treatment.

In some embodiments one or more steps can be performed prior to administration of the virus to the subject. Any of a variety of preceding steps can be performed including but not limited to diagnosing the subject with a condition appropriate for virus administration determining the immunocompetence of the subject immunizing the subject treating the subject with a chemotherapeutic agent treating the subject with radiation or surgically treating the subject.

For embodiments that include administering a virus to a tumor bearing subject for therapeutic purposes the subject has typically been previously diagnosed with a neoplastic condition. Diagnostic methods also can include determining the type of neoplastic condition determining the stage of the neoplastic conditions determining the size of one or more tumors in the subject determining the presence or absence of metastatic or neoplastic cells in the lymph nodes of the subject or determining the presence of metastases of the subject. Some embodiments of therapeutic methods for administering a virus to a subject can include a step of determination of the size of the primary tumor or the stage of the neoplastic disease and if the size of the primary tumor is equal to or above a threshold volume or if the stage of the neoplastic disease is at or above a threshold stage a virus is administered to the subject. In a similar embodiment if the size of the primary tumor is below a threshold volume or if the stage of the neoplastic disease is at or below a threshold stage the virus is not yet administered to the subject such methods can include monitoring the subject until the tumor size or neoplastic disease stage reaches a threshold amount and then administering the virus to the subject. Threshold sizes can vary according to several factors including rate of growth of the tumor ability of the virus to infect a tumor and immunocompetence of the subject. Generally the threshold size will be a size sufficient for a virus to accumulate and replicate in or near the tumor without being completely removed by the host s immune system and will typically also be a size sufficient to sustain a virus infection for a time long enough for the host to mount an immune response against the tumor cells typically about one week or more about ten days or more or about two weeks or more. Exemplary threshold tumor sizes for viruses such as vaccinia viruses are at least about 100 mm at least about 200 mm at least about 300 mm at least about 400 mm at least about 500 mm at least about 750 mm at least about 1000 mm or at least about 1500 mm. Threshold neoplastic disease stages also can vary according to several factors including specific requirement for staging a particular neoplastic disease aggressiveness of growth of the neoplastic disease ability of the virus to infect a tumor or metastasis and immunocompetence of the subject. Generally the threshold stage will be a stage sufficient for a virus to accumulate and replicate in a tumor or metastasis without being completely removed by the host s immune system and will typically also be a size sufficient to sustain a virus infection for a time long enough for the host to mount an immune response against the neoplastic cells typically about one week or more about ten days or more or about two weeks or more. Exemplary threshold stages are any stage beyond the lowest stage e.g. Stage I or equivalent or any stage where the primary tumor is larger than a threshold size or any stage where metastatic cells are detected.

In other embodiments prior to administering to the subject a virus the immunocompetence of the subject can be determined. The methods of administering a virus to a subject provided herein can include causing or enhancing an immune response in a subject. Accordingly prior to administering a virus to a subject the ability of a subject to mount an immune response can be determined. Any of a variety of tests of immunocompetence known in the art can be performed in the methods provided herein. Exemplary immunocompetence tests can examine ABO hemagglutination titers IgM leukocyte adhesion deficiency LAD granulocyte function NBT T and B cell quantitation tetanus antibody titers salivary IgA skin test tonsil test complement C3 levels and factor B levels and lymphocyte count. One skilled in the art can determine the desirability to administer a virus to a subject according to the level of immunocompetence of the subject according to the immunogenicity of the virus and optionally according to the immunogenicity of the neoplastic disease to be treated. Typically a subject can be considered immunocompetent if the skilled artisan can determine that the subject is sufficiently competent to mount an immune response against the virus.

In some embodiments the subject can be immunized prior to administering to the subject a virus according to the methods provided herein. Immunization can serve to increase the ability of a subject to mount an immune response against the virus or increase the speed at which the subject can mount an immune response against a virus. Immunization also can serve to decrease the risk to the subject of pathogenicity of the virus. In some embodiments the immunization can be performed with an immunization virus that is similar to the therapeutic virus to be administered. For example the immunization virus can be a replication incompetent variant of the therapeutic virus. In other embodiments the immunization material can be digests of the therapeutic virus to be administered. Any of a variety of methods for immunizing a subject against a known virus are known in the art and can be used herein. In one example vaccinia viruses treated with for example 1 microgram of psoralen and ultraviolet light at 365 nm for 4 minutes can be rendered replication incompetent. In another embodiment the virus can be selected as the same or similar to a virus against which the subject has been previously immunized e.g. in a childhood vaccination.

In another embodiment the subject can have administered thereto a virus without any previous steps of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy radiation therapy or surgical removal of a tumor and or metastases. The methods provided herein take advantage of the ability of the viruses to enter or localize near a tumor where the tumor cells can be protected from the subject s immune system the viruses can then proliferate in such an immunoprotected region and can also cause the release typically a sustained release of tumor antigens from the tumor to a location in which the subject s immune system can recognize the tumor antigens and mount an immune response. In such methods existence of a tumor of sufficient size or sufficiently developed immunoprotected state can be advantageous for successful administration of the virus to the tumor and for sufficient tumor antigen production. If a tumor is surgically removed the viruses may not be able to localize to other neoplastic cells e.g. small metastases because such cells have not yet have matured sufficiently to create an immunoprotective environment in which the viruses can survive and proliferate or even if the viruses can localize to neoplastic cells the number of cells or size of the mass can be too small for the viruses to cause a sustained release of tumor antigens in order for the host to mount an anti tumor immune response. Thus for example provided herein are methods of treating a tumor or neoplastic disease in which viruses are administered to a subject with a tumor or neoplastic disease without removing the primary tumor or to a subject with a tumor or neoplastic disease in which at least some tumors or neoplastic cells are intentionally permitted to remain in the subject. In other typical cancer treatment methods such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy such methods typically have a side effect of weakening the subject s immune system. This treatment of a subject by chemotherapy or radiation therapy can reduce the subject s ability to mount an anti tumor immune response. Thus for example provided herein are methods of treating a tumor or neoplastic disease in which viruses are administered to a subject with a tumor or neoplastic disease without treating the subject with an immune system weakening therapy such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

In an alternative embodiment prior to administration of a virus to the subject the subject can be treated in one or more cancer treatment steps that do not remove the primary tumor or that do not weaken the immune system of the subject. A variety of more sophisticated cancer treatment methods are being developed in which the tumor can be treated without surgical removal or immune system weakening therapy. Exemplary methods include administering a compound that decreases the rate of proliferation of the tumor or neoplastic cells without weakening the immune system e.g. by administering tumor suppressor compounds or by administering tumor cell specific compounds or administering an angiogenesis inhibiting compound. Thus combined methods that include administering a virus to a subject can further improve cancer therapy. Thus provided herein are methods of administering a virus to a subject along with prior to or subsequent to for example administering a compound that slows tumor growth without weakening the subject s immune system or a compound that inhibits vascularization of the tumor.

Any mode of administration of a virus to a subject can be used provided the mode of administration permits the virus to enter a tumor or metastasis. Modes of administration can include but are not limited to systemic intravenous intraperitoneal subcutaneous intramuscular transdermal intradermal intra arterial e.g. hepatic artery infusion intravesicular perfusion intrapleural intraarticular topical intratumoral intralesional multipuncture e.g. as used with smallpox vaccines inhalation percutaneous subcutaneous intranasal intratracheal oral intracavity e.g. administering to the bladder via a catheter administering to the gut by suppository or enema vaginal rectal intracranial intraprostatic intravitreal aural or ocular administration. Transporter substrate also can be similarly administered. In some examples both the virus and transporter substrates are administered systemically for detection imaging and or treatment of a tumor.

One skilled in the art can select any mode of administration compatible with the subject and the virus and that also is likely to result in the virus reaching tumors and or metastases. The route of administration can be selected by one skilled in the art according to any of a variety of factors including the nature of the disease the kind of tumor and the particular virus contained in the pharmaceutical composition. Administration to the target site can be performed for example by ballistic delivery as a colloidal dispersion system or systemic administration can be performed by injection into an artery.

The dosage regimen can be any of a variety of methods and amounts and can be determined by one skilled in the art according to known clinical factors. As is known in the medical arts dosages for any one patient can depend on many factors including the subject s species size body surface area age sex immunocompetence and general health the particular virus to be administered duration and route of administration the kind and stage of the disease for example tumor size and other treatments or compounds such as chemotherapeutic drugs being administered concurrently. In addition to the above factors such levels can be affected by the infectivity of the virus and the nature of the virus as can be determined by one skilled in the art. In the present methods appropriate minimum dosage levels of viruses can be levels sufficient for the virus to survive grow and replicate in a tumor or metastasis. Exemplary minimum levels for administering a virus to a 65 kg human can include at least about 1 10plaque forming units PFU at least about 5 10PFU at least about 1 10PFU at least about 5 10PFU at least about 1 10PFU at least about 1 10PFU at least about 1 10PFU or at least about 1 10PFU. In the present methods appropriate maximum dosage levels of viruses can be levels that are not toxic to the host levels that do not cause splenomegaly of 3 times or more levels that do not result in colonies or plaques in normal tissues or organs after about 1 day or after about 3 days or after about 7 days. Exemplary maximum levels for administering a virus to a 65 kg human can include no more than about 1 10PFU no more than about 5 10PFU no more than about 1 10PFU no more than about 5 10PFU no more than about 1 10PFU or no more than about 1 10PFU.

For combination therapies with chemotherapeutic compounds dosages for the administration of such compounds are known in the art or can be determined by one skilled in the art according to known clinical factors e.g. subject s species size body surface area age sex immunocompetence and general health duration and route of administration the kind and stage of the disease for example tumor size and other viruses treatments or compounds such as other chemotherapeutic drugs being administered concurrently . In addition to the above factors such levels can be affected by the infectivity of the virus and the nature of the virus as can be determined by one skilled in the art. For example Cisplatin also called cis platinum platinol cis diamminedichloroplatinum and cDDP is representative of a broad class of water soluble platinum coordination compounds frequently employed in the therapy of testicular cancer ovarian tumors and a variety of other cancers. See e.g. Blumenreich et al. 55 5 1118 1122 1985 Forastiere et al. 19 4 1088 1095 2001 . Methods of employing cisplatin clinically are well known in the art. For example cisplatin has been administered in a single day over a six hour period once per month by slow intravenous infusion. For localized lesions cisplatin can be administered by local injection. Intraperitoneal infusion can also be employed. Cisplatin can be administered in doses as low as 10 mg mper treatment if part of a multi drug regimen or if the patient has an adverse reaction to higher dosing. In general a clinical dose is from about 30 to about 120 or 150 mg mper treatment.

Typically platinum containing chemotherapeutic agents are administered parenterally for example by slow intravenous infusion or by local injection as discussed above. The effects of intralesional intra tumoral and IP administration of cisplatin is described in Nagase et al. 71 9 825 829 1987 and Theon et al. 202 2 261 7. 1993 .

In one exemplary embodiment the mutant vaccinia virus is administered once or 2 4 times with 0 60 days apart followed by 1 30 days where no anti cancer treatment then cisplatin is administered daily for 1 5 days followed by 1 30 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered. Each component of the therapy virus or cisplatin treatment or the virus and cisplatin combination therapy can be repeated. In another exemplary embodiment cisplatin is administered daily for 1 to 5 days followed by 1 10 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered then the mutant vaccinia virus is administered once or 2 4 times with 0 60 days apart. Such treatment scheme can be repeated. In another exemplary embodiment cisplatin is administered daily for 1 to 5 days followed by 1 10 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered then the mutant vaccinia virus is administered once or 2 4 times with 0 60 days apart. This is followed by 5 60 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered then cisplatin is administered again for 1 5 days. Such treatment scheme can be repeated.

Gemcitabine GEMZAR is another compound employed in the therapy of breast cancer non small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue that exhibits antitumor activity. Methods of employing gemcitabine clinically are well known in the art. For example gemcitabine has been administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 1000 mg mover 30 minutes once weekly for up to 7 weeks or until toxicity necessitates reducing or holding a dose followed by a week of rest from treatment of pancreatic cancer. Subsequent cycles can consist of infusions once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every 4 weeks. Gemcitabine has also been employed in combination with cisplatin in cancer therapy.

In one exemplary embodiment the mutant vaccinia virus is administered once or 2 4 times with 0 60 days apart followed by 1 30 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered then gemcitabine is administered 1 7 times with 0 30 days apart followed by 1 30 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered. Such treatment scheme can be repeated. In another exemplary embodiment gemcitabine is administered 1 7 times with 0 30 days apart followed by 1 10 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered then the mutant vaccinia virus is administered once or 2 4 times with 0 60 days apart. This is followed by 5 60 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered. Such treatment scheme can be repeated. In another exemplary embodiment gemcitabine is administered 1 7 times with 0 30 days apart followed by 1 10 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered then the mutant vaccinia virus is administered once or 2 4 times with 0 60 days apart. This is followed by 5 60 days where no anti cancer treatment is administered then gemcitabine is administered again for 1 7 times with 0 30 days apart. Such treatment scheme can be repeated.

As will be understood by one of skill in the art the optimal treatment regimen will vary and it is within the scope of the treatment methods to evaluate the status of the disease under treatment and the general health of the patient prior to and following one or more cycles of combination therapy in order to determine the optimal therapeutic combination.

The methods provided herein can include a single administration of a virus to a subject or multiple administrations of a virus to a subject. In some embodiments a single administration is sufficient to establish a virus in a tumor where the virus can proliferate and can cause or enhance an anti tumor response in the subject such methods do not require additional administrations of a virus in order to cause or enhance an anti tumor response in a subject which can result for example in inhibition of tumor growth inhibition of metastasis growth or formation reduction in tumor or size elimination of a tumor or metastasis inhibition or prevention of recurrence of a neoplastic disease or new tumor formation or other cancer therapeutic effects. In other embodiments a virus can be administered on different occasions separated in time typically by at least one day. Separate administrations can increase the likelihood of delivering a virus to a tumor or metastasis where a previous administration has been ineffective in delivering a virus to a tumor or metastasis. Separate administrations can increase the locations on a tumor or metastasis where virus proliferation can occur or can otherwise increase the titer of virus accumulated in the tumor which can increase the scale of release of antigens or other compounds from the tumor in eliciting or enhancing a host s anti tumor immune response and also can optionally increase the level of virus based tumor lysis or tumor cell death. Separate administrations of a virus can further extend a subject s immune response against viral antigens which can extend the host s immune response to tumors or metastases in which viruses have accumulated and can increase the likelihood of a host mounting an anti tumor immune response.

When separate administrations are performed each administration can be a dosage amount that is the same or different relative to other administration dosage amounts. In one embodiment all administration dosage amounts are the same. In other embodiments a first dosage amount can be a larger dosage amount than one or more subsequent dosage amounts for example at least 10 larger at least 100 larger or at least 1000 larger than subsequent dosage amounts. In one example of a method of separate administrations in which the first dosage amount is greater than one or more subsequent dosage amounts all subsequent dosage amounts can be the same smaller amount relative to the first administration.

Separate administrations can include any number of two or more administrations including two three four five or six administrations. One skilled in the art can readily determine the number of administrations to perform or the desirability of performing one or more additional administrations according to methods known in the art for monitoring therapeutic methods and other monitoring methods provided herein. Accordingly the methods provided herein include methods of providing to the subject one or more administrations of a virus where the number of administrations can be determined by monitoring the subject and based on the results of the monitoring determining whether or not to provide one or more additional administrations. Deciding on whether or not to provide one or more additional administrations can be based on a variety of monitoring results including but not limited to indication of tumor growth or inhibition of tumor growth appearance of new metastases or inhibition of metastasis the subject s anti virus antibody titer the subject s anti tumor antibody titer the overall health of the subject the weight of the subject the presence of virus solely in tumor and or metastases the presence of virus in normal tissues or organs.

The time period between administrations can be any of a variety of time periods. The time period between administrations can be a function of any of a variety of factors including monitoring steps as described in relation to the number of administrations the time period for a subject to mount an immune response the time period for a subject to clear the virus from normal tissue or the time period for virus proliferation in the tumor or metastasis. In one example the time period can be a function of the time period for a subject to mount an immune response for example the time period can be more than the time period for a subject to mount an immune response such as more than about one week more than about ten days more than about two weeks or more than about a month in another example the time period can be less than the time period for a subject to mount an immune response such as less than about one week less than about ten days less than about two weeks or less than about a month. In another example the time period can be a function of the time period for a subject to clear the virus from normal tissue for example the time period can be more than the time period for a subject to clear the virus from normal tissue such as more than about a day more than about two days more than about three days more than about five days or more than about a week. In another example the time period can be a function of the time period for virus proliferation in the tumor or metastasis for example the time period can be more than the amount of time for a detectable signal to arise in a tumor or metastasis after administration of a virus expressing a detectable marker such as about 3 days about 5 days about a week about ten days about two weeks or about a month.

Also provided are methods in which an additional therapeutic substance such as a different therapeutic virus or a therapeutic compound is administered. These can be administered simultaneously sequentially or intermittently with the first virus. The additional therapeutic substance can interact with the virus or a gene product thereof or the additional therapeutic substance can act independently of the virus.

Combination therapy treatment has advantages in that 1 it avoids single agent resistance 2 in a heterogeneous tumor population it can kill cells by different mechanisms and 3 by selecting drugs with non overlapping toxicities each agent can be used at full dose to elicit maximal efficacy and synergistic effect. Combination therapy can be done by combining a diagnostic therapeutic virus with one or more of the following anti cancer agents chemotherapeutic agents therapeutic antibodies siRNAs toxins enzyme prodrug pairs or radiation.

Methods are provided for administering to a subject two or more viruses. Administration can be effected simultaneously sequentially or intermittently. The plurality of viruses can be administered as a single composition or as two or more compositions. The two or more viruses can include at least two viruses. In a particular embodiment where there are two viruses both viruses are vaccinia viruses. In another embodiment one viruses is a vaccinia virus and the second viruses is any one of an adenovirus an adeno associated virus a retrovirus a herpes simplex virus a reovirus a mumps virus a foamy virus an influenza virus a myxoma virus a vesicular stomatitis virus or any other virus described herein or known in the art. Viruses can be chosen based on the pathway on which they act. For example a virus that targets an activated Ras pathway can be combined with a virus that targets tumor cells defective in p53 expression.

The plurality of viruses can be provided as combinations of compositions containing and or as kits that include the viruses packaged for administration and optionally including instructions therefore. The compositions can contain the viruses formulated for single dosage administration i.e. for direct administration and can require dilution or other additions.

In one embodiment at least one of the viruses is a modified virus such as those provided herein having a characteristic such as low pathogenicity low toxicity preferential accumulation in tumor ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells immunogenic replication competent ability to express exogenous proteins and combinations thereof. The viruses can be administered at approximately the same time or can be administered at different times. The viruses can be administered in the same composition or in the same administration method or can be administered in separate composition or by different administration methods.

The time period between administrations can be any time period that achieves the desired effects as can be determined by one skilled in the art. Selection of a time period between administrations of different viruses can be determined according to parameters similar to those for selecting the time period between administrations of the same virus including results from monitoring steps the time period for a subject to mount an immune response the time period for a subject to clear virus from normal tissue or the time period for virus proliferation in the tumor or metastasis. In one example the time period can be a function of the time period for a subject to mount an immune response for example the time period can be more than the time period for a subject to mount an immune response such as more than about one week more than about ten days more than about two weeks or more than about a month in another example the time period can be less than the time period for a subject to mount an immune response such as less than about one week less than about ten days less than about two weeks or less than about a month. In another example the time period can be a function of the time period for a subject to clear the virus from normal tissue for example the time period can be more than the time period for a subject to clear the virus from normal tissue such as more than about a day more than about two days more than about three days more than about five days or more than about a week. In another example the time period can be a function of the time period for virus proliferation in the tumor or metastasis for example the time period can be more than the amount of time for a detectable signal to arise in a tumor or metastasis after administration of a virus expressing a detectable marker such as about 3 days about 5 days about a week about ten days about two weeks or about a month.

In a non limiting embodiment a vaccinia virus such as a vaccinia virus provided herein is administered to a subject having a tumor cancer or metastasis in combination with a platinum coordination complex such as cisplatin carboplatin oxaliplatin DWA2114R NK121 IS 3 295 and 254 S. Tumors cancers and metastasis can be any of those provided herein and in particular can be a pancreatic tumor an ovarian tumor a lung tumor a colon tumor a prostate tumor a cervical tumor or a breast tumor exemplary tumors are pancreatic and ovarian tumors. Tumors cancers and metastasis can be a monotherapy resistant tumor such as for example one that does not respond to therapy with virus alone or anti cancer agent alone but that does respond to therapy with a combination of virus and anti cancer agent. Typically a therapeutically effective amount of virus is systemically administered to the subject and the virus localizes and accumulates in the tumor. Subsequent to administering the virus the subject is administered a therapeutically effective amount of an anti cancer agent such as cisplatin. In one example cisplatin is administered once daily for five consecutive days. One of skill in the art could determine when to administer the anti cancer agent subsequent to the virus using for example in vivo animal models. Using the methods provided herein administration of a virus and anti cancer agent such as cisplatin can cause a reduction in tumor volume can cause tumor growth to stop or be delayed or can cause the tumor to be eliminated from the subject. The status of tumors cancers and metastasis following treatment can be monitored using any of the methods provided herein and known in the art.

Exemplary anti cancer antibiotics include but are not limited to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin hydrochloride adriamycin idarubicin hydrochloride daunorubicin hydrochloride aclarubicin hydrochloride epirubicin hydrochloride and purarubicin hydrochloride pleomycins such as pleomycin and peplomycin sulfate mitomycins such as mitomycin C actinomycins such as actinomycin D zinostatinstimalamer and polypeptides such as neocarzinostatin. In one embodiment a vaccinia virus such as a vaccinia virus provided herein is administered to a subject having a tumor cancer or metastasis in combination with an anti cancer antibiotic.

In one embodiment nanoparticles can be designed such that they carry one or more therapeutic agents provided herein. Additionally nanoparticles can be designed to carry a molecule that targets the nanoparticle to the tumor cells. In one non limiting example nanoparticles can be coated with a radionuclide and optionally an antibody immunoreactive with a tumor associated antigen. In one embodiment a vaccinia virus such as a vaccinia virus provided herein is administered to a subject having a tumor cancer or metastasis in combination with a nanoparticle carrying any of the therapeutic agents provided herein.

Radiation therapy has become a foremost choice of treatment for a majority of cancer patients. The wide use of radiation treatment stems from the ability of gamma irradiation to induce irreversible damage in targeted cells with the preservation of normal tissue function. Ionizing radiation triggers apoptosis the intrinsic cellular death machinery in cancer cells and the activation of apoptosis seems to be the principal mode by which cancer cells die following exposure to ionizing radiation. In one embodiment a vaccinia virus such as a vaccinia virus provided herein is administered to a subject having a tumor cancer or metastasis in combination with radiation therapy.

Thus provided herein are methods of administering to a subject one or more therapeutic compounds that can act in conjunction with the virus to increase the proliferation toxicity tumor cell killing or immune response eliciting properties of a virus. Also provided herein are methods of administering to a subject one or more therapeutic compounds that can act in conjunction with the virus to decrease the proliferation toxicity or cell killing properties of a virus. Therapeutic compounds to be administered can be any of those provided herein or in the art.

Therapeutic compounds that can act in conjunction with the virus to increase the proliferation toxicity tumor cell killing or immune response eliciting properties of a virus are compounds that can alter gene expression where the altered gene expression can result in an increased killing of tumor cells or an increased anti tumor immune response in the subject. A gene expression altering compound can for example cause an increase or decrease in expression of one or more viral genes including endogenous viral genes and or exogenous viral genes. For example a gene expression altering compound can induce or increase transcription of a gene in a virus such as an exogenous gene that can cause cell lysis or cell death that can provoke an immune response that can catalyze conversion of a prodrug like compound or that can inhibit expression of a tumor cell gene. Any of a wide variety of compounds that can alter gene expression are known in the art including IPTG and RU486. Exemplary genes whose expression can be up regulated include proteins and RNA molecules including toxins enzymes that can convert a prodrug to an anti tumor drug cytokines transcription regulating proteins siRNA and ribozymes. In another example a gene expression altering compound can inhibit or decrease transcription of a gene in a virus such as a heterologous gene that can reduce viral toxicity or reduces viral proliferation. Any of a variety of compounds that can reduce or inhibit gene expression can be used in the methods provided herein including siRNA compounds transcriptional inhibitors or inhibitors of transcriptional activators. Exemplary genes whose expression can be down regulated include proteins and RNA molecules including viral proteins or RNA that suppress lysis nucleotide synthesis or proliferation and cellular proteins or RNA molecules that suppress cell death immunoreactivity lysis or viral replication.

In another embodiment therapeutic compounds that can act in conjunction with the virus to increase the proliferation toxicity tumor cell killing or immune response eliciting properties of a virus are compounds that can interact with a virally expressed gene product and such interaction can result in an increased killing of tumor cells or an increased anti tumor immune response in the subject. A therapeutic compound that can interact with a virally expressed gene product can include for example a prodrug or other compound that has little or no toxicity or other biological activity in its subject administered form but after interaction with a virally expressed gene product the compound can develop a property that results in tumor cell death including but not limited to cytotoxicity ability to induce apoptosis or ability to trigger an immune response. In one non limiting example the virus carries an enzyme into the cancer cells. Once the enzyme is introduced into the cancer cells an inactive form of a chemotherapy drug i.e. a prodrug is administered. When the inactive prodrug reaches the cancer cells the enzyme converts the prodrug into the active chemotherapy drug so that it can kill the cancer cell. Thus the treatment is targeted only to cancer cells and does not affect normal cells. The prodrug can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to the virus. A variety of prodrug like substances are known in the art and an exemplary set of such compounds are disclosed elsewhere herein where such compounds can include gancyclovir 5 fluorouracil 6 methylpurine deoxyriboside cephalosporin doxorubicin 4 2 chloroethyl 2 mesuloxyethyl amino benzoyl L glutamic acid acetaminophen indole 3 acetic acid CB1954 7 ethyl 10 4 1 piperidino 1 piperidino carbonyloxycamptothecin bis 2 chloroethyl amino 4 hydroxyphenyl aminomethanone 28 1 chloromethyl 5 hydroxy 1 2 dihyro 3H benz e indole epirubicin glucuronide 5 deoxy 5 fluorouridine cytosine arabinoside linamarin and a nucleoside analogue e.g. fluorouridine fluorodeoxyuridine fluorouridine arabinoside cytosine arabinoside adenine arabinoside guanine arabinoside hypoxanthine arabinoside 6 mercaptopurineriboside theoguanosine riboside nebularine 5 iodouridine 5 iododeoxyuridine 5 bromodeoxyuridine 5 vinyldeoxyuridine 9 2 hydroxy ethoxy methylguanine acyclovir 9 2 hydroxy 1 hydroxymethyl ethoxy methylguanine DHPG azauridine azacytidine azidothymidine dideoxyadenosine dideoxycytidine dideoxyinosine dideoxyguanosine dideoxythymidine 3 deoxyadenosine 3 deoxycytidine 3 deoxyinosine 3 deoxyguanosine 3 deoxythymidine .

In another embodiment therapeutic compounds that can act in conjunction with the virus to decrease the proliferation toxicity or cell killing properties of a virus are compounds that can inhibit viral replication inhibit viral toxins or cause viral death. A therapeutic compound that can inhibit viral replication inhibit viral toxins or cause viral death can generally include a compound that can block one or more steps in the viral life cycle including but not limited to compounds that can inhibit viral DNA replication viral RNA transcription viral coat protein assembly outer membrane or polysaccharide assembly. Any of a variety of compounds that can block one or more steps in a viral life cycle are known in the art including any known antiviral compound e.g. cidofovir viral DNA polymerase inhibitors viral RNA polymerase inhibitors inhibitors of proteins that regulate viral DNA replication or RNA transcription. In another example a virus can contain a gene encoding a viral life cycle protein such as DNA polymerase or RNA polymerase that can be inhibited by a compound that is optionally non toxic to the host organism.

In addition to combination therapy between chemotherapeutic agents and a virus provided herein other more complex combination therapy strategies could be applied as well. For example a combination therapy can include chemotherapeutic agents therapeutic antibodies and a virus provided herein. Alternatively another combination therapy can be the combination of radiation therapeutic antibodies and a virus provided herein. Therefore the concept of combination therapy also can be based on the application of a virus provided herein virus along with one or more of the following therapeutic modalities namely chemotherapeutic agents radiation therapy therapeutic antibodies hyper or hypothermia therapy siRNA diagnostic therapeutic bacteria diagnostic therapeutic mammalian cells immunotherapy and or targeted toxins delivered by antibodies liposomes and nanoparticles .

Effective delivery of each components of the combination therapy is an important aspect of the methods provided herein. In accordance with one aspect the modes of administration discussed below exploit one of more of the key features i delivery of a virus provided herein to the tumors by a mode of administration effect to achieve highest titer of virus and highest therapeutic effect ii delivery of any other mentioned therapeutic modalities to the tumor by a mode of administration to achieve the optimal therapeutic effect. The dose scheme of the combination therapy administered is such that the combination of the two or more therapeutic modalities is therapeutically effective. Dosages will vary in accordance with such factors as the age health sex size and weight of the patient the route of administration the toxicity of the drugs frequency of treatment and the relative susceptibilities of the cancer to each of the therapeutic modalities.

Therapeutic compounds also include but are not limited to compounds that exert an immunotherapeutic effect stimulate the immune system carry a therapeutic compound or a combination thereof. Optionally the therapeutic agent can exhibit or manifest additional properties such as properties that permit its use as an imaging agent as described elsewhere herein. Such therapeutic compounds include but are not limited to anti cancer antibodies radiation therapy siRNA molecules and compounds that suppress the immune system. Immunotherapy includes for example immune stimulating molecules protein based or non protein based cells and antibodies. Immunotherapy treatments can include stimulating immune cells to act more effectively or to make the tumor cells or tumor associated antigens recognizable to the immune system i.e. break tolerance .

Cytokines and growth factors include but are not limited to interleukins such as for example interleukin 1 interleukin 2 interleukin 6 and interleukin 12 tumor necrosis factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF interferons such as interferon gamma IFN granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factors GM CSF angiogenins and tissue factors.

Anti cancer antibodies include but are not limited to Rituximab RITUXAN ADEPT Trastuzumab HERCEPTIN Tositumomab BEXXAR Cetuximab ERBITUX Ibritumomab ZEVALIN Alemtuzumab Campath 1H Epratuzumab Lymphocide Gemtuzumab ozogamicin MYLOTARG Bevacimab AVASTIN and Edrecolomab PANOREX .

Thus provided herein are methods of administering to a subject one or more therapeutic compounds that can act in conjunction with the virus to stimulate or enhance the immune system thereby enhancing the effect of the virus. Such immunotherapy can be either delivered as a separate therapeutic modality or could be encoded if the immunotherapy is protein based by the administered virus.

Biological therapies are treatments that use natural body substances or drugs made from natural body substances. They can help to treat a cancer and control side effects caused by other cancer treatments such as chemotherapy. Biological therapies are also sometimes called Biological Response Modifiers BRM s biologic agents or simply biologics because they stimulate the body to respond biologically or naturally to cancer. Immunotherapy is treatment using natural substances that the body uses to fight infection and disease. Because it uses natural substances immunotherapy is also a biological therapy. There are several types of drugs that come under the term biological therapy these include for example monoclonal antibodies mAbs cancer vaccines growth factors for blood cells cancer growth inhibitors anti angiogenic factors interferon alpha interleukin 2 IL 2 gene therapy and BCG vaccine for bladder cancer

Monoclonal antibodies mAbs are of particular interest for treating cancer because of the specificity of binding to a unique antigen and the ability to produce large quantities in the laboratory for mass distribution. Monoclonal antibodies can be engineered to act in the same way as immune system proteins that is to seek out and kill foreign matter in your body such as viruses. Monoclonal antibodies can be designed to recognize epitopes on the surface of cancer cells. The antibodies target specifically bind to the epitopes and either kill the cancer cells or deliver a therapeutic agent to the cancer cell. Methods of conjugating therapeutic agents to antibodies is well known in the art. Different antibodies have to be made for different types of cancer for example Rituximab recognizes CD20 protein on the outside of non Hodgkin s lymphoma cells ADEPT is a treatment using antibodies that recognize bowel colon cancer and Trastuzumab HERCEPTIN recognizes breast cancer cells that produce too much of the protein HER 2 HER 2 positive . Other antibodies include for example Tositumomab BEXXAR Cetuximab ERBITUX Ibritumomab 90Y Ibritumomab tiuexetan ZEVALIN Alemtuzumab Campath 1H Epratuzumab Lymphocide Gemtuzumab ozogamicin MYLOTARG and Bevacimab AVASTIN . Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to one or more monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Rather than attempting to prevent infection such as is the case with the influenza virus cancer vaccines help treat the cancer once it has developed. The aim of cancer vaccines is to stimulate the immune response. Cancer vaccines include for example antigen vaccines whole cell vaccines dendritic cell vaccines DNA vaccines and anti idiotype vaccines. Antigen vaccines are vaccines made from tumor associated antigens in or produced by cancer cells. Antigen vaccines stimulate a subject s immune system to attack the cancer. Whole cell vaccines are vaccines that use the whole cancer cell not just a specific antigen from it to make the vaccine. The vaccine is made from a subject s own cancer cells another subject s cancer cells or cancer cells grown in a laboratory. The cells are treated in the laboratory usually with radiation so that they can t grow and are administered to the subject via injection or through an intravenous drip into the bloodstream so they can stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer. One type of whole cell vaccine is a dendritic cell vaccine which help the immune system to recognize and attack abnormal cells such as cancer cells. Dendritic cell vaccines are made by growing dendritic cells alongside the cancer cells in the lab. The vaccine is administered to stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer. Anti idiotype vaccines are vaccines that stimulate the body to make antibodies against cancer cells. Cancer cells make some tumor associated antigens that the immune system recognizes as foreign. But because cancer cells are similar to non cancer cells the immune system can respond weakly. DNA vaccines boost the immune response. DNA vaccines are made from DNA from cancer cells that carry the genes for the tumor associated antigens. When a DNA vaccine is injected it enables the cells of the immune system to recognize the tumor associated antigens and activates the cells in the immune system i.e. breaking tolerance . The most promising results from using DNA vaccines are in treating melanoma. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to a whole cell vaccine in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Growth factors are natural substances that stimulate the bone marrow to make blood cells. Recombinant technology can be used to generate growth factors which can be administered to a subject to increase the number of white blood cells red blood cells and stem cells in the blood. Growth factors used in cancer treatment to boost white blood cells include Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor G CSF also called filgrastim NEUPOGEN or lenograstim Granocyte and Granulocyte and Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor GM CSF also called molgramostim. A growth factor to help treat anemia is erythropoietin EPO . EPO encourages the body to make more red blood cells which in turn increases hemoglobin levels and the levels of oxygen in body tissues. Other growth factors are being developed which can boost platelets. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to a growth factor such as GM CSF in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Cancer growth inhibitors use cell signaling molecules which control the growth and multiplication of cells such as cancer cells. Drugs that block these signaling molecules can stop cancers from growing and dividing. Cancer growth factors include but are not limited to tyrosine kinases. Thus drugs that block tyrosine kinases are tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs . Examples of TKIs include but are not limited to Erlotinib TARCEVA OSI 774 IRESSA Gefitinib ZD 1839 and Imatinib GLIVEC STI 571 . Another type of growth inhibitor is Bortezomib VELCADE for multiple myeloma and for some other cancers. VELCADE is a proteasome inhibitor. Proteasomes are found in all cells and help break down proteins in cells. Interfering with the action of proteosomes causes a build up of proteins in the cell to toxic levels thereby killing the cancer cells. Cancer cells are more sensitive to VELCADE than normal cells. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to a cancer growth inhibitor such as VELCADE in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Cancers need a blood supply to expand and grow their own blood vessels as they get bigger. Without its own blood supply a cancer cannot grow due to lack of nutrients and oxygen. Anti angiogenic drugs stop tumors from developing their own blood vessels. Examples of these types of drugs include but are not limited to Thalidomide mainly for treating myeloma but also in trials for other types of cancer and Bevacizumab AVASTIN a type of monoclonal antibody that has been investigated for bowel cancer. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to an anti angiogenic drug in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Interferon alpha IFN is a natural substance produced in the body in very small amounts as part of the immune response. IFN is administered as a treatment to boost the immune system and help fight cancers such as renal cell kidney cancer malignant melanoma multiple myeloma and some types of leukemias. IFN works in several ways it can help to stop cancer cells growing it can also boost the immune system to help it attack the cancer and it can affect the blood supply to the cancer cells. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to IFN in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Administration of IL 2 is a biological therapy drug because it is naturally produced by the immune system. Thus it is also an immunotherapy. Interleukin 2 is used in treating renal cell kidney cancer and is being tested in clinical trials for several other types of cancers. IL 2 works directly on cancer cells by interfering with cell grow and proliferation it stimulates the immune system by promoting the growth of killer T cells and other cells that attack cancer cells and it also stimulates cancer cells to secrete chemoattractants that attract immune system cells. IL 2 is generally administered as a subcutaneous injection just under the skin once daily for 5 days followed by 2 days rest. The cycle of injections is repeated for 4 weeks followed by a week without treatment. The treatment regiment and the number of cycles administered depends on the type of cancer and how it responds to the treatment. IL 2 can be self administered or administered by a health professional. Alternatively IL 2 can be administered intravenously via injection or drip. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to IL 2 in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Gene therapy involves treating cancer by blocking abnormal genes in cancer cells repairing or replacing abnormal genes in cancer cells encouraging even more genes to become abnormal in cancer cells so that they die or become sensitive to treatment using viruses to carry treatment activating enzymes into the cancer cells or a combination thereof. As a result cancer cells die due to damage in the cell. Cancer cells develop as a result of several types of mutations in several of their genes. Targeted genes include but are not limited to those that encourage the cell to multiply i.e. oncogenes genes that stop the cell multiplying i.e. tumor suppressor genes and genes that repair other damaged genes. Gene therapy can involve repair of damaged oncogenes or blocking the proteins that the oncogenes produce. The tumor suppressor gene p53 is damaged in many human cancers. Viruses have been used in to deliver an undamaged p53 gene into cancer cells and early clinical trials are now in progress looking at treating cancers with modified p53 producing viruses. Gene therapy could be used to replace the damaged DNA repairing genes. In an alternative embodiment methods of increasing DNA damage within a tumor cell can promote death of the tumor cell or cause increased susceptibility of the tumor cell to other cancer treatments such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to any of the gene therapy methods provided herein or known in the art in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

Treatment of early stage bladder cancer is called intravesical treatment which is mainly used to treat stage T1 bladder cancers that are high grade grade 3 or G3 or carcinoma in situ of the bladder also known as T is or CIS . BCG is a vaccine for tuberculosis TB which also has been found to be effective in treating CIS and preventing bladder cancers from recurring. In some cases BCG vaccines have been used for treating grade 2 early bladder cancer. Because bladder cancer can occur anywhere in the bladder lining it cannot be removed in the same way as the papillary early bladder cancers. Rather a BCG vaccine is administered using intravesical therapy that is first a catheter tube put is inserted into the bladder followed by intra catheter administration of a BCG vaccine and or a chemotherapy. BCG treatment occurs weekly for 6 weeks or more depending on the effect on the bladder cancer. BCG treatment of bladder cancer can be combined with other types of treatments such as administration of chemotherapy intravesical IL 2 treatment with drugs that make cells sensitive to light vitamins and photodynamic therapy. Thus the viruses provided herein can be administered concurrently with or sequentially to BCG vaccines in the treatment of cancer. In one embodiment additional therapy is administered in the form of one or more of any of the other treatment modalities provided herein.

In another embodiment the methods provided herein for administering a virus to a subject can be performed on a subject in any of a variety of states including an anesthetized subject an alert subject a subject with elevated body temperature a subject with reduced body temperature or other state of the subject that is known to affect the accumulation of a virus in the tumor. As provided herein it has been determined that a subject that is anesthetized can have a decreased rate of accumulation of a virus in a tumor relative to a subject that is not anesthetized. Further provided herein it has been determined that a subject with decreased body temperature can have a decreased rate of accumulation of a virus in a tumor relative to a subject with a normal body temperature. Accordingly provided herein are methods of administering a virus to a subject where the methods can include administering a virus to a subject where the subject is not under anesthesia such as general anesthesia for example the subject can be under local anesthesia or can be unanesthetized. Also provided herein are methods of administering a virus to a subject where the methods can include administering a virus to a subject with altered body temperature where the alteration of the body temperature can influence the ability of the virus to accumulate in a tumor typically a decrease in body temperature can decrease the ability of a virus to accumulate in a tumor. Thus in one exemplary embodiment a method is provided for administering a virus to a subject where the method includes elevating the body temperature of the subject to a temperature above normal and administering a virus to the subject where the virus can accumulate in the tumor more readily in the subject with higher body temperature relative to the ability of the virus to accumulate in a tumor of a subject with a normal body temperature. In another embodiment localized elevations in temperature in the area surrounding the tumor can be used to increase the accumulation of the virus in the tumor.

The methods provided herein can further include one or more steps of monitoring the subject monitoring the tumor and or monitoring the virus administered to the subject. Any of a variety of monitoring steps can be included in the methods provided herein including but not limited to monitoring tumor size monitoring anti tumor antigen antibody titer monitoring the presence and or size of metastases monitoring the subject s lymph nodes monitoring the subject s weight or other health indicators including blood or urine markers monitoring anti viral antigen antibody titer monitoring viral expression of a detectable gene product and directly monitoring viral titer in a tumor tissue or organ of a subject.

The purpose of the monitoring can be simply for assessing the health state of the subject or the progress of therapeutic treatment of the subject or can be for determining whether or not further administration of the same or a different virus is warranted or for determining when or whether or not to administer a compound to the subject where the compound can act to increase the efficacy of the therapeutic method or the compound can act to decrease the pathogenicity of the virus administered to the subject.

In some embodiments the methods provided herein can include monitoring one or more virally expressed genes. Viruses such as those provided herein that encode a transporter protein or otherwise known in the art can express one or more detectable gene products including but not limited to detectable proteins. The infected cells tissue can thus be imaged by one more imaging methods. For example the infected cells can be imaged by administering a labeled transporter substrate that is transported into the infected cell by the expressed transporter protein. The localization of the accumulated transporter protein can detected thereby imaging the infected tissue. The viruses also can encode one more additional detectable proteins that can be imaged by optical or non optical imaging methods.

As provided herein measurement of a detectable gene product expressed by a virus can provide an accurate determination of the level of virus present in the subject. As further provided herein measurement of the location of the detectable gene product for example by imaging methods including but not limited to magnetic resonance fluorescence and tomographic methods can determine the localization of the virus in the subject. Accordingly the methods provided herein that include monitoring a detectable viral gene product can be used to determine the presence or absence of the virus in one or more organs or tissues of a subject and or the presence or absence of the virus in a tumor or metastases of a subject. Further the methods provided herein that include monitoring a detectable viral gene product can be used to determine the titer of virus present in one or more organs tissues tumors or metastases. Methods that include monitoring the localization and or titer of viruses in a subject can be used for determining the pathogenicity of a virus since viral infection and particularly the level of infection of normal tissues and organs can indicate the pathogenicity of the probe methods of monitoring the localization and or amount of viruses in a subject can be used to determine the pathogenicity of a virus. Since methods provided herein can be used to monitor the amount of viruses at any particular location in a subject the methods that include monitoring the localization and or titer of viruses in a subject can be performed at multiple time points and accordingly can determine the rate of viral replication in a subject including the rate of viral replication in one or more organs or tissues of a subject accordingly the methods of monitoring a viral gene product can be used for determining the replication competence of a virus. The methods provided herein also can be used to quantitate the amount of virus present in a variety of organs or tissues and tumors or metastases and can thereby indicate the degree of preferential accumulation of the virus in a subject accordingly the viral gene product monitoring methods provided herein can be used in methods of determining the ability of a virus to accumulate in tumor or metastases in preference to normal tissues or organs. Since the viruses used in the methods provided herein can accumulate in an entire tumor or can accumulate at multiple sites in a tumor and can also accumulate in metastases the methods provided herein for monitoring a viral gene product can be used to determine the size of a tumor or the number of metastases that are present in a subject. Monitoring such presence of viral gene product in tumor or metastasis over a range of time can be used to assess changes in the tumor or metastasis including growth or shrinking of a tumor or development of new metastases or disappearance of metastases and also can be used to determine the rate of growth or shrinking of a tumor or development of new metastases or disappearance of metastases or the change in the rate of growth or shrinking of a tumor or development of new metastases or disappearance of metastases. Accordingly the methods of monitoring a viral gene product can be used for monitoring a neoplastic disease in a subject or for determining the efficacy of treatment of a neoplastic disease by determining rate of growth or shrinking of a tumor or development of new metastases or disappearance of metastases or the change in the rate of growth or shrinking of a tumor or development of new metastases or disappearance of metastases.

Any of a variety of detectable proteins can be detected in the monitoring methods provided herein an exemplary non limiting list of such detectable proteins includes any of a variety of fluorescent proteins e.g. green or red fluorescent proteins any of a variety of luciferases transferrin or other iron binding proteins or receptors binding proteins and antibodies where a compound that specifically binds the receptor binding protein or antibody can be a detectable agent or can be labeled with a detectable substance e.g. a radionuclide or imaging agent . Viruses expressing a detectable protein can be detected by a combination of the method provided herein and know in the art. Viruses expressing more than one detectable protein or two or more viruses expressing various detectable protein can be detected and distinguished by dual imaging methods. For example a virus expressing a fluorescent protein and an iron binding protein can be detected in vitro or in vivo by low light fluorescence imaging and magnetic resonance respectively. In another example a virus expressing two or more fluorescent proteins can be detected by fluorescence imaging at different wavelength. In vivo dual imaging can be performed on a subject that has been administered a virus expressing two or more detectable gene products or two or more viruses each expressing one or more detectable gene products. In a particular example the viruses such as the hNET encoding viruses provided herein can be imaged by detection of the accumulation of a radiolabeled MIBG substrate that is transported by the hNET transporter into a tumor cell. Such viruses can also be imaged by optical methods such as detection of GFP expression by fluorescence imaging.

Also provided herein are methods of monitoring tumor and or metastasis size and location. Tumor and or metastasis size can be monitored by any of a variety of methods known in the art including external assessment methods or tomographic or magnetic imaging methods. In addition to the methods known in the art methods provided herein for example monitoring viral gene expression can be used for monitoring tumor and or metastasis size.

Monitoring size over several time points can provide information regarding the increase or decrease in size of a tumor or metastasis and can also provide information regarding the presence of additional tumors and or metastases in the subject. Monitoring tumor size over several time points can provide information regarding the development of a neoplastic disease in a subject including the efficacy of treatment of a neoplastic disease in a subject.

The methods provided herein also can include monitoring the antibody titer in a subject including antibodies produced in response to administration of a virus to a subject. The viruses administered in the methods provided herein can elicit an immune response to endogenous viral antigens. The viruses administered in the methods provided herein also can elicit an immune response to exogenous genes expressed by a virus. The viruses administered in the methods provided herein also can elicit an immune response to tumor antigens. Monitoring antibody titer against viral antigens viral expressed exogenous gene products or tumor antigens can be used in methods of monitoring the toxicity of a virus monitoring the efficacy of treatment methods or monitoring the level of gene product or antibodies for production and or harvesting.

In one embodiment monitoring antibody titer can be used to monitor the toxicity of a virus. Antibody titer against a virus can vary over the time period after administration of the virus to the subject where at some particular time points a low anti viral antigen antibody titer can indicate a higher toxicity while at other time points a high anti viral antigen antibody titer can indicate a higher toxicity. The viruses used in the methods provided herein can be immunogenic and can therefore elicit an immune response soon after administering the virus to the subject. Generally a virus against which a subject s immune system can quickly mount a strong immune response can be a virus that has low toxicity when the subject s immune system can remove the virus from all normal organs or tissues. Thus in some embodiments a high antibody titer against viral antigens soon after administering the virus to a subject can indicate low toxicity of a virus. In contrast a virus that is not highly immunogenic can infect a host organism without eliciting a strong immune response which can result in a higher toxicity of the virus to the host. Accordingly in some embodiments a high antibody titer against viral antigens soon after administering the virus to a subject can indicate low toxicity of a virus.

In other embodiments monitoring antibody titer can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment methods. In the methods provided herein antibody titer such as anti tumor antigen antibody titer can indicate the efficacy of a therapeutic method such as a therapeutic method to treat neoplastic disease. Therapeutic methods provided herein can include causing or enhancing an immune response against a tumor and or metastasis. Thus by monitoring the anti tumor antigen antibody titer it is possible to monitor the efficacy of a therapeutic method in causing or enhancing an immune response against a tumor and or metastasis. The therapeutic methods provided herein also can include administering to a subject a virus that can accumulate in a tumor and can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response. Accordingly it is possible to monitor the ability of a host to mount an immune response against viruses accumulated in a tumor or metastasis which can indicate that a subject has also mounted an anti tumor immune response or can indicate that a subject is likely to mount an anti tumor immune response or can indicate that a subject is capable of mounting an anti tumor immune response.

In other embodiments monitoring antibody titer can be used for monitoring the level of gene product or antibodies for production and or harvesting. As provided herein methods can be used for producing proteins RNA molecules or other compounds by expressing an exogenous gene in a virus that has accumulated in a tumor. Further provided herein are methods for producing antibodies against a protein RNA molecule or other compound produced by exogenous gene expression of a virus that has accumulated in a tumor. Monitoring antibody titer against the protein RNA molecule or other compound can indicate the level of production of the protein RNA molecule or other compound by the tumor accumulated virus and also can directly indicate the level of antibodies specific for such a protein RNA molecule or other compound.

The methods provided herein also can include methods of monitoring the health of a subject. Some of the methods provided herein are therapeutic methods including neoplastic disease therapeutic methods. Monitoring the health of a subject can be used to determine the efficacy of the therapeutic method as is known in the art. The methods provided herein also can include a step of administering to a subject a virus. Monitoring the health of a subject can be used to determine the pathogenicity of a virus administered to a subject. Any of a variety of health diagnostic methods for monitoring disease such as neoplastic disease infectious disease or immune related disease can be monitored as is known in the art. For example the weight blood pressure pulse breathing color temperature or other observable state of a subject can indicate the health of a subject. In addition the presence or absence or level of one or more components in a sample from a subject can indicate the health of a subject. Typical samples can include blood and urine samples where the presence or absence or level of one or more components can be determined by performing for example a blood panel or a urine panel diagnostic test. Exemplary components indicative of a subject s health include but are not limited to white blood cell count hematocrit or reactive protein concentration.

Also provided herein are methods of monitoring a therapy where therapeutic decisions can be based on the results of the monitoring. Therapeutic methods provided herein can include administering to a subject a virus where the virus can preferentially accumulate in a tumor and or metastasis and where the virus can cause or enhance an anti tumor immune response. Such therapeutic methods can include a variety of steps including multiple administrations of a particular virus administration of a second virus or administration of a therapeutic compound. Determination of the amount timing or type of virus or compound to administer to the subject can be based on one or more results from monitoring the subject. For example the antibody titer in a subject can be used to determine whether or not it is desirable to administer a virus or compound the quantity of virus or compound to administer and the type of virus or compound to administer where for example a low antibody titer can indicate the desirability of administering additional virus a different virus or a therapeutic compound such as a compound that induces viral gene expression. In another example the overall health state of a subject can be used to determine whether or not it is desirable to administer a virus or compound the quantity of virus or compound to administer and the type of virus or compound to administer where for example determining that the subject is healthy can indicate the desirability of administering additional virus a different virus or a therapeutic compound such as a compound that induces viral gene expression. In another example monitoring a detectable virally expressed gene product can be used to determine whether or not it is desirable to administer a virus or compound the quantity of virus or compound to administer and the type of virus or compound to administer. Such monitoring methods can be used to determine whether or not the therapeutic method is effective whether or not the therapeutic method is pathogenic to the subject whether or not the virus has accumulated in a tumor or metastasis and whether or not the virus has accumulated in normal tissues or organs. Based on such determinations the desirability and form of further therapeutic methods can be derived.

In one embodiment determination of whether or not a therapeutic method is effective can be used to derive further therapeutic methods. Any of a variety of methods of monitoring can be used to determine whether or not a therapeutic method is effective as provided herein or otherwise known in the art. If monitoring methods indicate that the therapeutic method is effective a decision can be made to maintain the current course of therapy which can include further administrations of a virus or compound or a decision can be made that no further administrations are required. If monitoring methods indicate that the therapeutic method is ineffective the monitoring results can indicate whether or not a course of treatment should be discontinued e.g. when a virus is pathogenic to the subject or changed e.g. when a virus accumulates in a tumor without harming the host organism but without eliciting an anti tumor immune response or increased in frequency or amount e.g. when little or no virus accumulates in tumor .

In one example monitoring can indicate that a virus is pathogenic to a subject. In such instances a decision can be made to terminate administration of the virus to the subject to administer lower levels of the virus to the subject to administer a different virus to a subject or to administer to a subject a compound that reduces the pathogenicity of the virus. In one example administration of a virus that is determined to be pathogenic can be terminated. In another example the dosage amount of a virus that is determined to be pathogenic can be decreased for subsequent administration in one version of such an example the subject can be pre treated with another virus that can increase the ability of the pathogenic virus to accumulate in tumor prior to re administering the pathogenic virus to the subject. In another example a subject can have administered thereto a virus that is pathogenic to the subject administration of such a pathogenic virus can be accompanied by administration of for example an antiviral compound e.g. cidofovir pathogenicity attenuating compound e.g. a compound that down regulates the expression of a lytic or apoptotic gene product or other compound that can decrease the proliferation toxicity or cell killing properties of a virus as described herein elsewhere. In one variation of such an example the localization of the virus can be monitored and upon determination that the virus is accumulated in tumor and or metastases but not in normal tissues or organs administration of the antiviral compound or pathogenicity attenuating compound can be terminated and the pathogenic activity of the virus can be activated or increased but limited to the tumor and or metastasis. In another variation of such an example after terminating administration of the antiviral compound or pathogenicity attenuating compound the presence of the virus and or pathogenicity of the virus can be further monitored and administration of such a compound can be reinitiated if the virus is determined to pose a threat to the host by for example spreading to normal organs or tissues releasing a toxin into the vasculature or otherwise having pathogenic effects reaching beyond the tumor or metastasis.

In another example monitoring can determine whether or not a virus has accumulated in a tumor or metastasis of a subject. Upon such a determination a decision can be made to further administer additional virus a different virus or a compound to the subject. In another example monitoring the presence of a virus in a tumor can be used in deciding to administer to the subject a compound where the compound can increase the pathogenicity proliferation or immunogenicity of a virus or the compound can otherwise act in conjunction with the virus to increase the proliferation toxicity tumor cell killing or immune response eliciting properties of a virus in one variation of such an example the virus can for example have little or no lytic or cell killing capability in the absence of such a compound in a further variation of such an example monitoring of the presence of the virus in a tumor or metastasis can be coupled with monitoring the absence of the virus in normal tissues or organs where the compound is administered if the virus is present in tumor or metastasis and not at all present or substantially not present in normal organs or tissues in a further variation of such an example the amount of virus in a tumor or metastasis can be monitored where the compound is administered if the virus is present in tumor or metastasis at sufficient levels.

In some examples an isolated cell such as a mammalian cell can contain any of the viruses provided herein that encode a transporter protein. For example an isolated cell can be infected with a virus provided herein. Exemplary of such cells are tumor cells stem cells immune cells or other cells that can localize in tumor tissues. The virally infected cells also can be administered to patient or subject with a tumor for diagnosis and or treatment of the tumor.

The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Modified vaccinia viruses containing DNA encoding several types of transporter proteins were generated by removing and inserting nucleic acid at several gene loci in a vaccinia virus genome including F14.5L also referred to as F3 see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0031643 thymidine kinase TK J2R and or hemagglutinin HA A56R gene loci. The heterologous DNA inserted into the virus genome included expression cassettes containing protein encoding. DNA operably linked to a vaccinia virus promoter. Modified vaccinia strains encoding the following transporter proteins were generated Human norepinephrine transporter hNET and the human sodium iodide symporter hNIS . Modified vaccinia viruses containing a transporter gene hNET and a anti cancer therapeutic gene IL 24 also were generated.

The starting strain for the modified vaccinia viruses described herein was vaccinia virus VV strain GLV 1h68 also named RVGL21 SEQ ID NO 1 . This genetically engineered strain which has been described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0031643 contains DNA insertions in the F14.5L thymidine kinase TK and hemagglutinin HA genes. GLV 1h68 was prepared from the vaccinia virus strain designated LIVP a vaccinia virus strain originally derived by adapting the vaccinia Lister strain ATCC Catalog No. VR 1549 to calf skin Research Institute of Viral Preparations Moscow Russia Al tshtein et al. 1983 285 696 699 . The LIVP strain whose genome sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO 2 and from which GLV 1h68 was generated contains a mutation in the coding sequence of the TK gene in which a substitution of a guanine nucleotide with a thymidine nucleotide nucleotide position 80207 of SEQ ID NO 2 introduces a premature STOP codon within the coding sequence.

As described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0031643 see particularly Example 1 of the application GLV 1h68 was generated by inserting expression cassettes encoding detectable marker proteins into the F14.5L also designated in LIVP as F3 gene thymidine kinase TK gene and hemagglutinin HA gene loci of the vaccinia virus LIVP strain. Specifically an expression cassette containing a Ruc GFP cDNA a fusion of DNA encoding luciferase and DNA encoding GFP under the control of a vaccinia synthetic early late promoter Pwas inserted into the F14.5L gene an expression cassette containing DNA encoding beta galactosidase under the control of the vaccinia early late promoter P denoted P LacZ and DNA encoding a rat transferrin receptor positioned in the reverse orientation for transcription relative to the vaccinia synthetic early late promoter P denoted P rTrfR was inserted into the TK gene the resulting virus does not express transferrin receptor protein since the DNA encoding the protein is positioned in the reverse orientation for transcription relative to the promoter in the cassette and an expression cassette containing DNA encoding glucuronidase under the control of the vaccinia late promoter P denoted P gusA was inserted into the HA gene.

Insertion of the expression cassettes into the LIVP genome to generate the GLV 1h68 strain resulted in disruption of the coding sequences for each of the F14.5L TK and HA genes accordingly all three genes in the resulting strains are nonfunctional in that they do not encode the corresponding full length proteins. As described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0031643 disruption of these genes not only attenuates the virus but also enhances its tumor specific accumulation. Previous data have shown that systemic delivery of the GLV 1h68 virus in a mouse model of breast cancer resulted in the complete eradication of large subcutaneous G1 101A human breast carcinoma xenograft tumors in nude mice see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0031643 .

Modified recombinant vaccinia viruses containing heterologous DNA inserted into one or more loci of the vaccinia virus genome were generated via homologous recombination between DNA sequences in the genome and a transfer vector using methods described herein and known to those of skill in the art see e.g. Falkner and Moss 1990 64 3108 2111 Chakrabarti et al. 1985 5 3403 3409 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 722 848 . In these methods the existing target gene in the starting vaccinia virus genome is replaced by an interrupted copy of the gene contained in the transfer vector through two crossover events a first crossover event of homologous recombination between the vaccinia virus genome and the transfer vector and a second crossover event of homologous recombination between direct repeats within the target locus. The interrupted version of the target gene that is in the transfer vector contains the insertion DNA flanked on each side by DNA corresponding to the left portion of the target gene and right portion of the target gene respectively. The transfer vector also contains a dominant selection marker e.g. the guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gpt gene under the control of a vaccinia virus early promoter e.g. P . Including such a marker in the vector enables a transient dominant selection process to identify recombinant virus grown under selective pressure that has incorporated the transfer vector within its genome. Because the marker gene is not stably integrated into the genome it is deleted from the genome in a second crossover event that occurs when selection is removed. Thus the final recombinant virus contains the interrupted version of the target gene as a disruption of the target loci but does not retain the selectable marker from the transfer vector.

Homologous recombination between a transfer vector and a starting vaccinia virus genome occurred upon introduction of the transfer vector into cells that have been infected with the starting vaccinia virus. A series of transfer vectors was constructed as described below and the following modified vaccinia strains were constructed GLV 1h99 GLV 1h100 GLV 1h101 GLV 1h139 GLV 1h146 GLV 1h150 GLV 1h151 GLV 1h152 GLV 1h153. The construction of these strains is summarized in the following Table which lists the modified vaccinia virus strains including the previously described GLV 1h68 their respective genotypes and the transfer vectors used to engineer the viruses 

GLV 1h99 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding hNET under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the F14.5L locus of starting strain GLV 1h68 thereby deleting the Ruc GFP fusion gene expression cassette at the F14.5L locus of starting GLV 1h68. Thus in strain GLV 1h99 the vaccinia F14.5L gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNET operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early promoter.

GLV 1h100 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding hNET under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the TK locus of starting strain GLV 1h68 thereby deleting the LacZ rTFr expression cassette at the TK locus of starting GLV 1h68. Thus in strain GLV 1h100 the vaccinia TK gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNET operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early promoter.

GLV 1h101 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding hNET under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the TK locus of starting strain GLV 1h68 thereby deleting the LacZ rTFr expression cassette at the TK locus of starting GLV 1h68. Thus in strain GLV 1h101 the vaccinia TK gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNET operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic late promoter.

GLV 1h139 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding hNET under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the HA locus of starting strain GLV 1h68 thereby deleting the gusA expression cassette at the HA locus of starting GLV 1h68. Thus in strain GLV 1h139 the vaccinia HA gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNET operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early promoter.

GLV 1h146 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding IL 24 under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the HA locus of starting strain GLV 1h100 thereby deleting the gusA expression cassette at the HA locus of starting GLV 1h100. Thus in strain GLV 1h146 the vaccinia HA gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding IL 24 operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early promoter and the vaccinia TK gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNET operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early promoter.

GLV 1h150 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding IL 24 under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the HA locus of starting strain GLV 1h101 thereby deleting the gusA expression cassette at the HA locus of starting GLV 1h101. Thus in strain GLV 1h150 the vaccinia HA gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding IL 24 operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early promoter and the vaccinia TK gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNET operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic late promoter.

GLV 1h151 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding hNIS under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the HA locus of starting strain GLV 1h68 thereby deleting the gusA expression cassette at the HA locus of starting GLV 1h68. Thus in strain GLV 1h151 the vaccinia HA gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNIS operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early promoter.

GLV 1h152 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding hNIS under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the HA locus of starting strain GLV 1h68 thereby deleting the gusA expression cassette at the HA locus of starting GLV 1h68. Thus in strain GLV 1h152 the vaccinia HA gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNIS operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic early late promoter.

GLV 1h153 was generated by insertion of an expression cassette encoding hNIS under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter into the HA locus of starting strain GLV 1h68 thereby deleting the gusA expression cassette at the HA locus of starting GLV 1h68. Thus in strain GLV 1h153 the vaccinia HA gene is interrupted within the coding sequence by a DNA fragment containing DNA encoding hNIS operably linked to the vaccinia synthetic late promoter.

The HA SL hNIS 1 vector SEQ ID NO. 23 was employed to create vaccinia virus strain GLV 1h153 having the following genotype F14.5L P Ruc GFP TK P rTrfR P LacZ HA P hNIS. HA SL hNIS 1 contains the human sodium iodide symporter hNIS under the control of the vaccinia Ppromoter flanked by sequences of the HA gene. To generate vector HA SL hNIS 1 the hNIS cDNA was released from pCRII hNIS 2 with Sal I and Pac I enzyme digestion and subcloned into same cut vector HA SL RLN 3 SEQ ID NO. 24 thereby replacing RLN cDNA. The resulting construct HA SL hNIS 1 was confirmed by sequencing.

African green monkey kidney fibroblast CV 1 cells American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. CCL 70 were employed for viral generation and production. The cells were grown in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM supplemented with 1 antibiotic antimycotic solution Mediatech Inc. Herndon Va. and 10 fetal bovine serum FBS Mediatech Inc. Herndon Va. at 37 C. under 5 CO. For virus generation of recombinant viruses the CV 1 cells were infected with GLV 1h68 or designated parental virus see Table 2 at m.o.i. of 0.1 for 1 hr. The infected cells were then transfected using Fugene Roche Indianapolis Ind. with the designated transfer vector see Table 2 and description of viral transfer vectors above . At two days post infection infected transfected cells were harvested and the recombinant viruses were selected and plaque purified using standard methods as described previously Falkner and Moss 1990 64 3108 3111 .

The genotype of the vaccinia viruses was verified by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. The lack of expression of gusA gene in viruses GLV 1h139 GLV 1h146 GLV 1h150 GLV 1h151 GLV 1h152 and GLV 1h153 was confirmed X GlcA 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl D glucuronic acid staining of the infected cells. Viruses lacking gusA expression are unable to convert the X GlcA substrate as indicated by lack of development of blue color in the assay as compared to a control strain e.g. GLV 1h68 . Lack of expression of the GFP gene in GLV 1h99 was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy as compared to a control strain e.g. GLV 1h68 . The lack of expression of the LacZ gene for viruses GLV 1h100 GLV 1h101 GLV 1h146 and GLV 1h150 was confirmed by X gal 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl D galactopyranoside staining of the infected cells. Viruses lacking lacZ expression are unable to convert the X gal substrate as indicated by lack of development of blue color in the assay as compared to a control strain e.g. GLV 1h68 . Standard techniques for X GlcA and X gal viral staining and fluorescence microscopy were employed and are well known in the art.

Ten T225 flasks of confluent CV 1 cells seeded at 2 10cells per flask the day before infection were infected with each virus at m.o.i. of 0.1. The infected cells were harvested two days post infection and lysed using a glass Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 1 800 g for 5 min and then layered on a cushion of 36 sucrose and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm in a HB 6 rotor Sorvall RC 5B Refrigerated Superspeed Centrifuge for 2 hours. The virus pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 1 mM Tris pH 9.0 loaded on a sterile 24 to 40 continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 26 000 g for 50 min. The virus band was collected and diluted using 2 volumes of 1 mM Tris pH 9.0 and then centrifuged at 13 000 rpm in a HB 6 rotor for 60 min. The final virus pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 1 mM Tris pH 9.0 and the titer was determined in CV 1 cells ATCC No. CCL 70 .

To evaluate any effects of hNET expression on vaccinia virus replication PANC 1 cells were infected with either GLV 1h99 or its parent virus GLV 1h68 at moi of 0.01 for 1 h at 37 C. The inoculum was then aspirated and the cell monolayers were washed twice with 2 ml of DPBS Mediatech Inc. Herndon Va. . Two milliliters of cell culture medium containing 2 FBS were added into each well of a multiwell plate. Three wells each were harvested at 24 48 and 72 hours post infection. The harvested cells were subject to three cycles of freeze thaw and were sonicated three times for 1 minute at full power before titration. The viral titers at each time point were determined in CV 1 cells using a standard plaque assay.

GLV 1h99 gave significantly higher viral yields approximately 10 fold at all three time points in comparison with its parental virus GLV 1h68. The enhanced viral replication for GLV 1h99 may be due to the difference in the strength of the vaccinia viral promoter at the F14.5L locus in the viruses. GLV 1h68 contains a strong vaccinia Ppromoter which is 100 times stronger than a Ppromoter Chakrabarti et al. 1997 23 6 1094 7 . Previous studies have shown that virus replication in cell culture is inversely proportional with strength of promoters inserted into the viral genome. Thus the use of a Ppromoter in the GLV 1h99 can result in the higher viral titers observed.

 The PANC 1 cells used in the study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. and maintained in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM supplemented with 1 antibiotic antimycotic solution Mediatech Inc. Herndon Va. and 10 fetal bovine serum FBS Mediatech Inc. Herndon Va. at 37 C. under 5 CO .

Mesothelioma MSTO 211H H2373 JMN and H2052 and pancreatic cancer PANC 1 MiaPaCa2 BxPC3 and HS766T cell lines were plated at 2 10per well in 12 well plates in 1 ml of media per well. After incubation for 6 hours cells were infected with GLV 1h99 or GLV 1h68 at MOI s multiplicity of infection of 1.0 0.10 and 0.01 and 0 control wells . Viral cytotoxicity was measured daily for 7 days. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 200 l per well of 1.5 Triton X Sigma St. Louis Mo. to release intracellular lactate dehydrogenase which was quantified with a Cytotox 96 kit Promega Madison Wis. on a spectrophotometer EL321e Bio Tek Instruments at 490 nm. Results were measured as the percentage of surviving cells. This percentage was determined by comparing the measured lactate dehydrogenase of each infected sample to that in uninfected control cells. All samples were analyzed in triplicate. Four mesothelioma and four pancreatic cancer cell lines demonstrated lytic cytotoxicity following exposure to GLV 1h99 hNET expressing virus and to GLV 1h68 non hNET containing virus . Similar cytotoxicity was observed with GLV 1h99 and GLV 1h68 at a MOI of 1.0 and a dose dependent lytic effect was also demonstrated for m.o.i. ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. At a MOI of 0.1 all MSTO 211H and H2052 mesothelioma cells as well as 80 of the PANC1 pancreatic cancer cells were dead at day 7. Oncolysis appeared to be more gradual over time in PANC1 cells compared to the more sigmoidal lytic time profile in MSTO 211H cells. The mesothelioma cell line JMN and the pancreatic cancer cell line HS766T were more resistant to cell death 80 cell death by day 7 at a MOI of 1.0 . MiaPaCa2 and BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cell lines and H2373 mesothelioma cell line were sensitive to the virus at a higher MOI of 10.

To evaluate the level of hNET protein expression in cells CV 1 cells in 60 mm dishes were infected with GLV 1h68 or GLV 1h99 at m.o.i of approximately 10. Approximately two days post infection cells were harvested and solubilized in RIPA buffer 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 150 mM NaCl 1 mM EDTA 0.1 SDS 1 Triton X 100 1 sodium deoxycholate and proteinase inhibitor cocktail . The cell lysates were separated on a 4 12 Bis Tris Gel Invitrogen and proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane Amersham Biosciences . The membrane was incubated with an anti hNET monoclonal antibody NET17 1 Mab Technologies Stone Mountain Calif. at a dilution of approximately 1 500 and detected using WesternBreeze Chromogenic Western Blot Immunodetection Kit Invitrogen . GLV 1 h99 infected cells expressed hNET protein whereas cells either mock infected or infected with GLV 1h68 did not. Five major bands 35 47 50 65 73 kDa were detected in GLV 1h99 infected CV 1 cells.

In a separate experiment the two most sensitive mesothelioma cell lines MSTO 211H and H2052 and the most sensitive pancreatic cancer cell line PANC1 based on the cytotoxicity assays were chosen for immunoblot analysis and compared to the endogenous hNET expressing neuroblastoma cell line SK N SH. hNET protein expression was evaluated in cells infected with either GLV 1h99 or GLV 1h68 viruses at a MOI of 1.0 at 12 24 48 and 72 h after infection. A purified mouse antibody against hNET NET17 1 Mab Tech Inc. GA USA was used at a final dilution of 1 500 and incubated for 12 hours at 4 C. The secondary antibody peroxidase conjugated anti mouse IgG Vector labs Inc. CA USA exposure was for 1 hour at a 1 2000 dilution. Peroxidase bound protein bands were visualized using the ECL method Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Little Chalfont UK .

In addition to the 80 kD hNET band two low molecular weight immunoreactive bands 50 55 kD and 37 40 kD respectively are seen in the blots of the GLV 1h99 infected cells these bands are barely visible in the blots of the SK N SH neuroblastoma cells. Similar to the cytotoxicity assay there was a viral dose dependent expression of hNET at different MOI s 0.1 1.0 5 and 10 . Strong hNET expression was found in all the three cell lines by 12 hours after GLV 1h99 viral infection peaking at 24 hours followed by a gradual decline over 72 hours. A similar pattern of hNET expression was observed in the other cell lines although the hNET immunoblot bands were less intense. The neuroblastoma cell line SK N SH expressing endogenous hNET served as a positive control for the immunoblot analysis and radiotracer uptake studies the GLV 1h68 virus infected non hNET containing virus and the uninfected mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer cell lines served as negative controls showing no hNET expression.

 I MIBG radiotracer uptake studies were performed in MSTO 211h and PANC1 cells after infection with virus GLV 1h99 or GLV 1h68 at a MOI of 1.0 as well as in the neuroblastoma cell line SK N SH using previously described methods Che J et al. 2005 4 128 36. For these studies clinical grade I MIBG was obtained from MDS Nordion Canada . The average radiochemical purity was in excess of 97 determined by MDS Nordion using the Sep Pak cartridge method and the specific activity 320 MBq mmol 8.7 mCi mol according to the vendor. I MIBG was prepared using minor modifications to the reported nucleophilic isotopic exchange method Eersels J et al. 2005 48 241 57 following a procedure previously reported Moroz M A et al. 2007 48 827 36 . The radiochemical purity of the final product was 95 with an overall yield of 80 and the specific activity 18.5 5.2 MBq mol 0.5 0.14 mCi mol . The maximum specific activities no carrier added synthesis for the I and I labeled compounds were 8.9 and 1.2 TBq mol 241 and 33 Ci mmol respectively due to the 7.4 fold difference in the decay rate of the two isotopes.

For the uptake assay cells were plated at 1 10per well in 6 well plates in 2 ml of media per well. After incubation for 6 hours cells were infected with GLV 1h68 or GLV1h99 at MOIs of 1.0 and 0 control wells . Following 12 24 48 and 72 h incubation periods with virus at 37 C. and 5 CO the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed with PBS pH 7.4 . I MIBG uptake was initiated by adding 2 ml of DME containing 0.0185 MBq ml 0.5 Ci ml carrier free I MIBG. Cells were harvested after a 60 minute incubation period and the cell pellet to medium activity ratio cpm gm of pellet cpm ml of medium was calculated from the radioactivity measurements assayed in a gamma counter Packard United Technologies . All studies were performed in triplicate. A two tailed unpaired t test was applied to determine the significance of differences between values using the MS Office 2003 Excel 11.0 statistical package Microsoft Redmond Wash. USA .

 I MIBG accumulation in non infected MSTO 211H and PANC1 cells was low. There was no significant increase in radiotracer uptake 24 h after infection of the cells with GLV 1h68 non hNET containing virus negative control . In contrast there was a significant p

Athymic nu nu female mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute NCl MD and were housed five per cage and allowed food and water ad libitum in the MSKCC Vivarium for 1 week before tumor cell implantation. All animal studies were performed in compliance with all applicable policies procedures and regulatory requirements of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC the Research Animal Resource Center RARC of MSKCC and the National Institutes of Health NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All animal procedures were performed under anesthesia induced by inhalation of 2 isoflurane. After the studies all animals were sacrificed by COasphyxiation.

An incision 3 to 5 mm in length was made over the fourth to fifth intercostal space of the right chest. The underlying inflating and deflating lung was thereby easily visualized through the thin fascia. Slowly 100 l of MSTO 211H malignant mesothelioma cellular suspension 5 10cells were injected. After the injection the skin was closed with surgical staples and mice were returned to their cages.

Intrapleural treatment with virus was performed in a similar fashion as described above 10 days after tumor cell instillation into the pleural cavity. GLV 1h99 or GLV 1h68 1 10pfu was administered in 100 L PBS and animals were gently rotated from side to side to help distribute the virus throughout the pleural cavity. Control animals no virus received only 100 L PBS.

Each animal was injected intravenously with 18.5 MBq 500 Ci of I MIBG 48 or 72 hours after intrapleural GLV 1h99 injection. Sequential PET imaging was performed 1 to 48 hours after radiotracer administration using a X SPECT dedicated small animal gamma camera SPECT CT scanner Gamma Medica Northridge Calif. . A photopeak energy window of 143 175 keV and a low energy high resolution LEHR parallel hole collimator was used to acquire ten minute I images at 2 hours post I MIBG administration.

The X SPECT gamma camera system was calibrated by imaging a mouse size 30 ml cylinder filled with an independently measured concentration MBq ml of technetium 99 m using a photopeak energy window of 126 154 keV and LEHR collimation. The resulting Tc images were exported to Intefile and then imported into the ASIPro Siemens Pre clinical Solutions Knoxyille T N image processing software environment. By region of interest ROI analysis a system calibration factor in cpm pixel per MBq ml was derived. Animal images were likewise exported to Interfile and then imported into ASIPro and parameterized in terms of the decay corrected percent injected dose per gram ID gm based on the foregoing calibration factor the administered activity the time post administration of imaging and the image duration. Implicit in the foregoing analysis is the reasonable assumption that the sensitivities of the X SPECT gamma camera system for I and Tc are comparable.

In a group of 5 animals 10 days after MSTO 211H tumor cell instillation into the pleural cavity each animal was injected via the tail vein with 9.25 MBq 250 Ci of F FDG. Clinical grade F FDG was obtained from IBA Molecular Somerset N J with a specific activity 41 MBq mol 11 mCi mmol and a radiochemical purity of 98 . F FDG PET scanning was performed 1 h after tracer administration using a 10 minute list mode acquisition. Animals were fasted 12 h before tracer administration and kept under anesthesia between FDG injection and imaging.

In a group of 16 animals 4 sub groups of 3 5 animals each were studied 5 animals in sub group 1 and 2 3 animals in sub group 3 and 4 . Each animal was injected via the tail vein with 9.25 MBq 250 Ci of I MIBG. Animals in sub groups 1 and 2 were injected with GLV 1h99 48 and 72 h prior to MIBG administration. Sub group 3 animals received GLV 1h68 48 h prior to radiotracer administration sub group 4 animals was not injected with virus receiving only 100 l PBS . Potassium iodide was used to block the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid. MIBG PET was performed for 10 minute 1 2 and 4 h after tracer administration for 15 minute at 12 h for 30 minute at 24 h and for 60 minute at 48 h. After tracer administration and between imaging time points the animals were allowed to wake up and maintain normal husbandry.

Imaging was performed using a Focus 120 microPET dedicated small animal PET scanner Concorde Microsystems Inc Knoxyille T N . Three dimensional 3D list mode data were acquired using an energy window of 350 700 keV for F and 410 580 keV for I respectively and a coincidence timing window of 6 ns. These data were then sorted into two dimensional 2D histograms by Fourier re binning. The image data were corrected for a non uniformity of scanner response using a uniform cylinder source based normalization b dead time count losses using a singles count rate based global correction c physical decay to the time of injection and d the I branching ratio. The count rates in the reconstructed images were converted to activity concentration of injected dose per gram of tissue ID g using a system calibration factor MBq ml per cps voxel derived from imaging of a mouse size phantom filled with a uniform aqueous solution of F.

Image analysis was performed using ASIPro Siemens Pre clinical Solutions Knoxyille T N . ROI s were manually drawn over tumor lung liver and skeletal muscle. For each tissue and time point post injection the measured radioactivity was expressed as ID g. The maximum value was recorded for each tissue and tumor to organ ratios for lung liver and skeletal muscle were then calculated. A two tailed unpaired t test was applied to determine the significance of differences between values using the MS Office 2003 Excel 11.0 statistical package Microsoft Redmond Wash. USA .

Tumor radioactivity values ID g were measured and tumor to organ ratios were calculated. The highest levels of radioactivity in the pleural tumors were found 48 h after injection of GLV 1h99 hNET expressing virus followed by tumors that were injected with GLV 1h99 72 h prior to I MIBG administration. Low levels of radioactivity were observed in tumors that were injected with GLV 1h68 non hNET containing virus and in tumors that were not injected with virus. Maximum activity in both the pleural tumors and remote organs background were observed at the time of the initial measurement 1 hour after radiotracer administration. Tumor and remote organ activity decreased over time 1 to 72 hours in all four groups of animals. The decrease in tumor activity was more rapid over the first 12 hours after I MIBG administration in the two control groups tumors injected with GLV 1h68 non hNET containing virus or no virus.

Tumor to organ lung liver muscle ratios were calculated from the PET image data and the highest values were obtained for the group of animals that were infected with GLV 1h99 hNET expressing virus 48 h before radiotracer administration. Comparing the animals that were treated with GLV 1h99 48 h before I MIBG administration to the animals that received no virus the ratio differences were highly significant p

For localization of the tumors and for comparison to a clinically used imaging technique F FDG PET imaging was also performed. I MIBG PET and F FDG PET imaging were compared. The pleural tumors were visualized by F FDG PET imaging but image contrast at 48 and 72 hours after GLV 1h99 virus hNET expressing virus injection was greater with I MIBG PET compared to F FDG PET. The MIBG and F FDG tumor to lung tumor to liver and tumor to muscle ratios in control animals were similar.

In vivo hNET expression in the pleural tumors after GLV 1h99 hNET expressing virus administration was also imaged by I MIBG planar scintigraphy as described above. All GLV 1h99 injected animals showed localized accumulation of I MIBG radioactivity in the virus injected pleural tumors compared to the control animals that received no virus. The tumor to background ratios for the GLV 1h99 infected animals was with 2.4 0.2 significantly p

After each final image was taken the animals were sacrificed and the tumors harvested and frozen in Tissue Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature O.C.T. Compound Sakura Finetek USA Inc. Torrance Calif. . Tissues were cut into 5 m thick sections and mounted on glass slides. Cryosections were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin H E and 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl B D galactopyranoside X gal 1 mg ml in an iron solution of 5 mmol l KFe CN 5 mmol l KFe CN and 2 mmol l MgCl as previously described Kelly K et al. 2008 22 1839 48 to identify virally mediated lacZ expression.

All pleural lesions were shown to be malignant pleural mesothelioma on H E staining. In addition all tumors infected with vaccinia virus stained positive for lacZ confirming the presence of the virus in tumors and indicating that all tumors visualized by I MIBG PET or I MIBG scintigraphy reflected GLV 1h99 expression of a functional hNET transporter protein.

The hNET expressing virus GLV 1h99 is derived from the parental virus strain GLV 1h68 which can eradicate solid human breast tumors in nude mice with a single intravenous i.v. injection see U.S. Patent Publication 2005 0031643 . The effect of replacing the Ruc GFP expression cassette at the F14.5L gene locus in GLV 1h68 with hNET expression cassette on the anti tumor properties of the virus were examined. A mouse xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer was employed for the study.

PANC 1 xenograft tumors were developed in 6 8 weeks old male nude mice NCl Hsd Athymic Nude Foxn1 Harlan by implanting 5 10PANC 1 cells subcutaneously on the right hind leg. Tumor growth was recorded once a week in three dimensions using a digital caliper. Tumor volume was calculated as length width height 2 and reported in mm. Twenty seven days after tumor cell implantation groups of 8 mice were injected with a single i.v. dose of 5 10pfu of GLV 1h68 or GLV 1h99 in 100 l of PBS. As described previously the growth of tumors treated with GLV 1h68 can be divided into three phases growth inhibition and regression Zhang et al. 2007 67 20 10038 46 . The tumors treated with GLV 1h99 showed similar growth pattern to the GLV 1h68 tumors however the tumors started to shrink one week earlier for the GLV 1h99 injected mice as compared with GLV 1h68 treated tumors. The tumor started to shrink after day 13 following virus administration for the GLV 1h99 mice whereas the GLV 1h68 mice did not exhibit tumor shrinkage until after day 21 following virus administration. The degree of initial tumor shrinkage also slightly faster in the GLV 199 injected mice. Near complete eradication of the tumor was observed around 53 57 days following viral administration. Expression of hNET did not have any negative effects on vaccinia virotherapy. The accelerated tumor shrinkage by GLV 1h99 is consistent with the enhanced viral replication in tissue culture in comparison with GLV 1h68.

Similar results also were observed in a human breast tumor GI 101A xenograft nude mouse model treated with GLV 1h68 and GLV 1h99. To develop subcutaneous s.c breast tumors in mice human breast cancer GI 101A cells Rumbaugh Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research Inc. Plantation Fla. U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 533 at a dose of 5 10cells 0.1 ml mouse were injected s.c. into the right hind leg of 6 8 week old female athymic mice. On day 31 after GI 101A cell implantation when median tumor size was about 500 mm GLV 1h68 and GLV 1 h99 viruses at the dose of 10PFU mouse were injected i.v. into the femoral vein. Tumor shrinkage for the GLV 1h99 virus was observed at around day 24 whereas the GLV 1h68 virus did not show tumor shrinkage in this experiment until after day 30. Previously published results for the GLV 1h68 virus which showed that GLV 1h68 viruses show tumor shrinkage of G101A tumors earlier around day 25 by either tail vein or femoral vein administration of the virus see Zhang et al. 2007 67 20 10038 46 though no comparison was made to GLV 1h99 viruses in the particular experiment. When compared to GLV 1h68 overall GLV 1h99 appeared to shrink tumors faster in both xenograft models.

The percentage of body weight change following intravenous administration of the GLV 1h99 viruses was examined in immunocompetent animals. C57BL 6 female mice were injected i.v. with either 1 10pfu or 1 10pfu of GLV 1h68 or GLV 1h99 viruses. Body weights were monitored once a week and calculated ate percentage body weigh over time. Neither the GLV 1h68 or GLV 1h99 viruses caused any significant decrease in body weight over the course of the study for either dosage of virus tested. All mice exhibited comparable increases in body weight over the 60 day period with the GLV 1h68 infected mice show slightly higher increases in body weight which may be reflective of the lower replication rate of the virus.

Since modifications will be apparent to those of skill in this art it is intended that this invention be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
