This application is a continuation of U.S. patent Ser. No. 13 348 429 filed Jan. 11 2012 which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 8 119 607 filed Jul. 1 2009 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 077 972 filed Jul. 3 2008 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Nucleoside drugs have been used clinically for decades for the treatment of viral infections and proliferative disorders such as cancer. Most nucleoside drugs analogues are classified as antimetabolites. After they enter cells nucleoside analogues are phosphorylated successively to nucleotide 5 mono phosphates 5 di phosphates and 5 tri phosphates. In some cases nucleotide tri phosphates e.g. 3 azido 3 deoxythymidine tri phosphate AZT an anti human immunodeficiency virus HIV drug and arabinosylcytosine tri phosphate cytarabine an anticancer drug are the active chemical entities that inhibit DNA or RNA synthesis through competitive inhibition of polymerases and subsequent incorporation of modified nucleotides into DNA or RNA sequences. In a few cases nucleoside analogues exert effects as their 5 monophosphate or 5 diphosphate. For instance 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine 5 mono phosphate an anticancer drug and 2 2 difluoro 2 deoxycytidine 5 di phosphate an anticancer drug have been shown to inhibit thymidylate synthase and ribonucleotide reductase respectively. Although unphosphorylated nucleoside analogues themselves may act as adenosine kinases inhibitors and adenosine receptor ligands currently clinically useful nucleoside drugs primarily depend on cellular activation by nucleoside and nucleotide kinases.

Viral infections are a major threat to human health and account for many serious infectious diseases. The most notable viruses are the blood borne viruses BBV which include hepatitis C virus HCV hepatitis B virus HBV and HIV which are all linked by their mode of transmission i.e. through blood or bodily fluids.

The Flaviviridae is a group of positive single stranded RNA viruses with a genome size from 9 15 kilobases kb . The Flaviviridae consist of various genera including Flavivirus and Hepacivirus. Flavivirus includes Dengue Japanese Tick Borne and Yellow Fever viruses. Apart from these major groups there are some additional Flavivirus that are unclassified. Hepacivirus include only one species the Hepatitis C virus which is composed of many genotypes and subtypes.

Hepatitis C virus is a major cause of viral hepatitis and has infected more than 200 million people worldwide. Hepatitis C virus has a positive strand RNA genome enclosed in a nucleocapsid and lipid envelope. The HCV genome is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein of about 3 000 amino acids Dymock et al. 2000 11 79 . Current treatment for HCV infection is restricted to immunotherapy with interferon alone or in combination with ribavirin a nucleoside analogue. However this treatment is effective in only about half the patient population. Recently several PCT patent applications WO 99 43691 WO 01 32153 WO 01 60315 WO 01 79246 WO 01 90121 WO 01 92282 WO 02 18404 WO 02 057287 and WO 02 057425 have described nucleoside analogues as anti HCV agents in in vitro assays.

Hepatitis B virus has acutely infected almost a third of the human population and about 5 of the infected are chronic carriers of the virus Delaney W E et al. 2001 12 1 35 . Chronic HBV infection causes liver damage that frequently progresses to cirrhosis and or liver cancer later in life. Despite the availability and widespread use of effective vaccines and chemotherapy the number of chronic HBV carriers approaches 400 million worldwide.

Human immunodeficiency virus causes progressive degeneration of the immune system leading to the development of AIDS. A number of drugs have been used clinically to treat AIDS including reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Currently combination therapies are used widely for the treatment of AIDS in order to reduce drug resistance. Despite the progress in the development of anti HIV drugs AIDS is still one of the leading epidemic diseases.

Apart from the BBV s discussed above certain other acute viral infections also pose a great threat to human life including infections of Herpes Simplex virus HSV cytomegalovirus CMV influenza viruses West Nile virus Coronaviruses causing for example severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS Variola virus causing smallpox Epstein Barr virus EBV virus VZV and Human respiratory syncytial virus RSV . Accordingly the broad range of associated infectious diseases and the propensity for viral mutation highlight the continued need for the development of different antiviral drugs.

Bacterial infections have long been the source of many infectious diseases. The widespread use of antibiotics has produced many new strains of life threatening antibiotic resistant bacteria. Fungal infections are another type of infectious disease some of which are also life threatening. There is an ever increasing demand for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections. As such antimicrobial drugs based on new mechanisms of action are especially important.

Proliferative disorders for example cancer are some of the most life threatening diseases today and have been investigated intensively for decades. Cancer is currently the second leading cause of death in the United States and over 500 000 people die annually from this proliferative disorder. All of the various nucleated cell types of the body can be transformed into benign or malignant tumour cells. Transformation of normal cells into cancer cells is a complex process and is not understood fully. Cancer treatment includes primarily surgery radiation therapy and chemotherapy. While chemotherapy can be used to treat many types of cancer surgery and radiation therapy are limited to certain cancers at certain sites of the body. There are a number of anticancer drugs widely used clinically. Among them are alkylating agents such as cisplatin and antimetabolites such as 5 fluorouracil and gemcitabine. Although surgery radiation therapy and chemotherapy are available to treat cancer patients there is no cure for cancer at the present time. Cancer research remains one of the most important focuses of medical and pharmaceutical organizations.

Numerous examples exist in the literature for the synthesis of a variety of modified nucleosides Chemistry of Nucleosides and Nucleotides Vol. 1 1988 Vol. 2 1991 Vol. 3 1994 edited by Leroy B. Townsend Plenum Press . However there are certain classes of nucleoside compounds that have not been explored fully for their antiviral and anti proliferative activities. One such class is the bicyclic nucleosides.

Similarly cycloalkyl substituted bicyclic nitrogenous base analogues are being employed as protein kinase inhibitors to combat uncontrolled cell growth such as is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0203143.

In a further aspect a pharmaceutical dosage form is provided for use in treating a hepatitis C viral infection by administering to a subject once per day said pharmaceutical dosage form comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound 

In another embodiment a pharmaceutical dosage form includes a hydrochloride salt of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. In a further embodiment a pharmaceutical dosage form includes an ester of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. In another embodiment a pharmaceutical dosage form includes a prodrug of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. In a further embodiment a pharmaceutical dosage form includes an oral a rectal a nasal a topical a buccal a sublingual a transdermal a vaginal an injection or a parental dosage form. In a further embodiment a pharmaceutical dosage form is an oral dosage form.

The present disclosure is directed to methods of treatment kits combinations compounds including their use in the manufacture of medicaments and compositions that exhibit antiproliferative effects for example via the inhibition of DNA and or RNA synthesis and that particularly may inhibit activity of one or more polymerases or that treat a condition where treatment with a polymerase inhibitor such as a DNA and or RNA synthesis inhibitor is indicated. In one embodiment a DNA and or RNA synthesis inhibitor includes a bicyclic nucleoside and or nucleotide having activity as a polymerase inhibiting agent.

While the present disclosure may be embodied in many different forms several specific embodiments are discussed herein with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered only as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and does not limit the invention to the embodiments illustrated. For example where the invention is illustrated herein with particular reference to a compound having inhibitory activity against an HCV NS5B polymerase it will be understood that other polymerases can if desired be substituted in whole or in part for the HCV polymerase herein described.

Although not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that a microbial and or a proliferative disease or disorder may be treated attenuated and or prevented through manipulation of polymerase activity by using a compound herein described. For example one microbial polymerase target NS5B an HCV protein is released from a polyprotein and is involved in the synthesis of double stranded RNA from a single stranded viral RNA genome. It is believed that the replication and or reproduction of HCV virus may be inhibited or prevented through the inhibition of NS5B and suppress or prevent the formation of the double stranded HCV RNA. Alternatively it is also believed that a nucleoside analogue also may be incorporated into the extending RNA strand to act as a chain terminator and or lead to null mutations. Furthermore it is believed that a nucleoside analogue or a derived metabolite also may be incorporated into the extending RNA which may cause mutagenic damage to the viral genome.

It is also believed that proliferative disorders including for example acute myelogenous leukemia cholangiocarcinoma chronic myelogenous leukemia lymphoma melanoma multiple myeloma osteosarcoma gastric sarcoma glioma bladder breast cervical colorectal lung liver ovarian pancreatic prostrate or stomach cancer and non cancerous diseases associated with excessive and or inappropriate cell growth including endothelial cell growth associated with restenosis such as coronary carotid and cerebral lesions may also be inhibited and or prevented through the manipulation of polymerase activity by the compounds described herein such as D and or L nucleosides and nucleotides of formula I below. Further decreases in proliferation rates of highly proliferative and or cancerous cells may be achieved in a manner similar to those described above namely that antiproliferative nucleoside analogues may be incorporated into the RNA and or replicating genomes of highly proliferative and or cancerous cells causing for example chain terminator frame shift and or null mutations that disrupt downstream effector mechanisms required for cell proliferation and metabolic homeostasis.

Such compounds may be screened for antiproliferative and or polymerase inhibitory activity by in vitro or in vivo methods known to those skilled in the art in addition to the methods set forth herein

Still further and not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that one or more criteria are desirable for a nucleoside antiviral and or antiproliferative drug including for example that the nucleoside analogue anabolises to a nucleotide in cells and or that the anabolised nucleotide selectively targets viral proteins and or proliferative mechanisms including for example peptide and or nucleic acid based enzymes. It is believed that in order to be phosphorylated in cells and selectively target preferred enzymes nucleoside analogues may have favourable modifications on their sugar and base moieties. To obtain such favourable nucleoside analogues a general approach is to generate diverse nucleoside analogues by modifying the base or the sugar or by modifying both base and sugar moieties. Numerous examples exist in the literature for the synthesis of a variety of modified nucleosides including for example Vol. 1 1988 Vol. 2 1991 Vol. 3 1994 edited by L. B. Townsend Plenum Press by H. Vorbr ggen and C. Ruh Pohlenz John Wiley Sons Inc. 2001 and by Y. Mizuno Elsevier 1986. The resulting modified compounds can then be assayed for desired activity as discussed more fully herein.

While nucleosides incorporating a variety of sugar moieties have been found useful for the inhibition of viral polymerases in the case of the Flaviviridae and in particular HCV 2 C methyl ribonucleosides have been found to be useful see Eldrup A. B. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004 47 21 5284 97 .

The terms infection and microbial infection and variations thereof refers to an infection caused by an infectious agent or microbe used herein to include at least bacteria parasites including protozoa viruses and fungi including unicellular and multicellular . Examples of microbes and microbial infections include which causes African sleeping sickness which causes amebiasis which causes American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease sp. which cause schistosomiasis or bilharzia which causes cryptosporidiosis which causes giardiasis hepatitis A B C D and E sp. which cause cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis which causes malaria which causes stomach cramps diarrhea and fever which causes tuberculosis virus which causes chicken pox yellow fever virus pneumonia and sp. which cause for example urinary tract infections meningitis and meningococcal septicemia which causes skin and soft tissue infections and lower respiratory tract infections bacterial pathogens or viral pathogens .

Additional common infections caused by microbes include but are not limited to those outlined in the following chart 

In relation to therapeutic methods of the present disclosure compounds of formula I can be useful for inhibiting a polymerase including for example HCV NS5B polymerase and or microbial replication such as HCV replication and treating a microbial infection such as HCV infection. Hosts that can be treated may include a unicellular organism including a cell line or a multicellular organism such as an animal which may have one or more host specific and or invasive proteins encoded within their genomes and functioning in parallel with host proliferative mechanisms or in collaboration with host mechanism in effect to form new virions for example or to alter normal host proliferative patterns. For example a host includes infected cells cells transfected with all or part of a genome encoding a polymerase such as the HCV genome or an animal having a proliferative disorder or a microbial infection such as a viral infection caused by an RNA virus including for example a virus belonging to group Flaviviridae for instance Flaviviruses or HCV or a DNA or retrovirus such as HBV or HIV.

In one embodiment a method of the present disclosure treats a viral infection caused by an RNA virus of the group Flaviviridae and in particular HCV. An illustrative process for treating a host animal having a condition associated with a pathological microbial infection or a proliferative disorder includes administering to the effected host a compound described herein in a therapeutic effective amount. An example of a therapy includes repeated administration of a therapeutic effective amount of one or more compounds to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome such as eliminating and or reducing a viral load in a host to a level below that prior to the administration of the compound. Another example of a therapy may include repeated administration of sub therapeutic effective amounts that over time accumulate to a therapeutic effective amount. In a further example a single dose of an effective amount of one or more compounds and or salts esters solvates hydrates and prodrugs thereof to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome is envisioned.

In one embodiment a compound may be used for treating a host animal such as a mouse rat pig cow rabbit dog cat horse bird lizard fish or primates such as a monkey chimpanzee or human that has a condition associated with pathological polymerase activity such as a microbial infection and or a proliferative disorder.

As used herein the terms therapeutically effective amount or therapeutically effective dose and variations thereof mean an amount of a compound of formula I which when administered to a host animal according to a desired dosing regimen provides a desired therapeutic activity for therapeutic treatment and or prophylactic treatment such as for example at least partially attaining the desired effect and or delaying the onset of and or inhibiting the progression of and or preventing halting or reversing altogether the onset or progression of the particular disease disorder and or condition being treated. Dosing may be in a single or divided dose and may occur at intervals of minutes hours days weeks months or years or continuously over any one of these periods but it is recognized that once daily dosing is a desirable because of the ease of adherence to the regimen by the patient especially when the duration of dosing is more than a few days. The half life of the drug is an important pharmacokinetic parameter in deciding the dosing frequency. The time needed to achieve steady state drug concentrations as well as the time needed to establish new steady state concentrations after a change in dosage regimen is a function of the elimination half life of the active therapeutic entity. For once daily dosing a plasma t of 6 hours is generally required in order to minimize Cmax Cmin fluctuations. In the present description it has been exemplified that compound 9 has a plasma half life of 4 7.6 hours in preclinical animal species. Furthermore the intracellular half life of the active anabolite of compound 9 compound 25 is 38 hours in primary human hepatocytes. The long intracellular half life of the active triphosphate anabolite coupled with its plasma half life generally suggest that compound 9 can be administered if desired once daily for therapeutic treatment and or prophylactic treatment of a disease in a patient including for example an infection or microbial infection such as an infection of liver cells including chronic hepatitis C.

Suitable dosages lie within the range of about 0.1 ng per kg of body weight to about 10 g per kg of body weight or in the range of about 1 g to about 10 g per kg of body weight or in the range of about 10 g to about 30 mg per kg of body weight or in the range of about 15 g to about 25 mg per kg of body weight or in the range of about 1 mg to about 10 g per kg of body weight or in the range of about 1 mg to about 500 mg per kg of body weight or in the range of about 1 mg to about 250 mg per kg of body weight or in the range of about 1 mg to about 100 mg per kg of body weight per dosage or up to about 50 mg per body weight per dosage or greater or less amounts per body weight per dosage.

While not intended to limit the scope of the invention when administered to an animal such as a human the composition may be administered at a dose for example a therapeutic effective amount to achieve a peak plasma of active molecule of about 0.1 nM to about 100 nM 0.1 M to about 100 M or about 0.5 M to about 75 M or about 1 M to about 50 M or greater than or equal to about 0.1 or greater than or equal to about 0.5 M or greater than or equal to about 1 M and or intracellular concentration of about 0.1 pmol million cells to about 100 pmol million cells 100 pmol million cells to about 1000 pmol million cells or about 1000 pmol million cells to about 10000 pmol million cells or greater than or equal to about 10 pmol million cells or greater than or equal to about 50 pmol million cells or greater than or equal to about 100 pmol million cells and may be adjusted over time according to individual need and condition. The peak plasma and or intracellular concentration of active molecule achieved depends on several factors familiar to those skilled in the art including for example route of administration rates of absorption protein binding compound conversion compound anabolism compound catabolism incorporation of a compound into a genome and excretion and inactivation rates.

Suitable dosage amounts and dosing regimens may be selected in accordance with a variety of factors including one or more particular conditions being treated the severity of the one or more conditions the genetic profile age health sex diet and weight of the subject the route of administration alone or in combination with pharmacological considerations including the activity efficacy bioavailability pharmacokinetic and toxicological profiles of the particular compound employed whether a drug delivery system is utilised and whether the drug is administered as part of a drug combination. Therefore the dosage regimen to be employed may vary widely and may necessarily deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.

In one embodiment an active ingredient of the present disclosure may be administered in a single dose or a series of doses. While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone for example as a fraction of a formulation scheme and or a purified compound from a batch reaction it may be desirable to present it as a composition such as a pharmaceutical composition. Formulation of such compositions is well known to those skilled in the art. For example a candidate pharmaceutical composition may contain one or more carriers diluents and or excipients and any combination thereof whereby such carriers are inactive pharmaceutical ingredients. Examples include conventional solvents dispersion media fillers solid carriers coatings antifungal agents antibacterial agents antiviral agents dermal penetration agents surfactants isotonic agents absorption agents adjuvants analgesics stabilisers preservatives drugs and the like. It will be understood that the compositions of the invention may also include other supplementary physiologically active agents. These carriers diluents and excipients make up a pharmaceutical carrier system for the compound of formula I.

A candidate carrier that is to be administered to an animal is pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and suitably tolerated by the host. Compositions may be adapted according to the desired route of administration. For example compositions herein may be formulated for oral rectal nasal topical including buccal and sublingual transdermal vaginal injection injectable and or parental including subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous and intradermal administration. Other suitable administration routes are incorporated herein. The compositions may be presented conveniently in unit dosage forms and may be prepared by any methods known in the pharmaceutical arts.

Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine known to a skilled artisan a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated and or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow and or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using for example hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide one or more desired release profiles. Tablets may be provided optionally with an enteric coating to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach.

Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges including the active ingredient in a flavoured or unflavoured base usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth gum pastilles including the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatine and glycerin and or sucrose and acacia gum and mouthwashes including the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier with or without flavouring and or additional ingredients.

Compositions suitable for topical administration to the skin may comprise the compounds dissolved or suspended in any suitable carrier and or base and may be in the form of lotions gel creams pastes ointments and the like. Suitable carriers include mineral oil propylene glycol polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene emulsifying wax sorbitan monostearate polysorbate 60 cetyl esters wax cetearyl alcohol 2 octyldodecanol benzyl alcohol and water.

Compositions for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base including for example cocoa butter glycerin gelatine and or polyethylene glycol among others. Compositions suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries tampons creams gels pastes foams and or spray formulations containing compositions containing one or more active ingredient compounds of the present disclosure in addition to one or more carriers known in the art.

Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include for example aqueous and non aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants buffers bactericides and or solutes that render the composition isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include for example suspending agents and thickening agents. Parenteral compositions may be presented in unit dose or multi dose sealed containers for example ampoules and vials and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilised condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier for example water for injections immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets of the kind described previously. In addition compositions and formulations may be delivered by a dry powder inhaler in the form of a dry powder or delivered by a mist inhaler in the form of a mist.

It should be understood that in addition to the active ingredients mentioned above compositions herein may include other agents as appropriate for the type of composition in question. For example compositions suitable for oral administration may include for example binders colorants sweeteners thickeners flavouring agents disintegrating agents coating agents preservatives lubricants and or time delay agents. Suitable sweeteners include for example sucrose lactose glucose aspartame and or saccharine.

Compounds of the present disclosure can possess one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers as well as in the form of racemic or non racemic mixtures thereof. The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes well known in the art for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts by treatment with an optically active acid or base. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric diacetyltartaric dibenzoyltartaric ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid and then separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystallization followed by liberation of the optically active bases from these salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column optimally chosen to maximise the separation of the enantiomers.

Still another available method involves synthesis of covalent diastereomeric molecules for example esters amides acetals ketals and the like by reacting compounds of formula I with an optically active acid in an activated form an optically active diol or an optically active isocyanate. The synthesised diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional means such as chromatography distillation crystallization or sublimation and then hydrolyzed to deliver the enantiomerically pure compound. In some cases hydrolysis to the parent optically active drug is not necessary prior to dosing the patient since the compound can behave as a prodrug. The optically active compounds of formula I can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials.

In addition to the optical isomers or potential optical isomers discussed above other types of isomers are specifically intended to be included in this disclosure. Examples include cis isomers trans isomers E isomers Z isomers syn isomers anti isomers tautomers and the like. Aryl heterocyclyl or heteroaryl tautomers heteroatom isomers and ortho meta or para substitution isomers are also included as isomers. Solvates or solvent addition compounds such as hydrates or alcoholates are also specifically included both as chemicals of this disclosure and in for example formulations or pharmaceutical compositions for delivery.

Equivalents of the general formulas set forth above for the disclosed compounds and derivatives as well as the intermediates are compounds otherwise corresponding thereto and having the same general properties such as tautomers thereof and compounds wherein one or more of the various R groups are simple variations of the substituents as defined therein for example wherein R is a higher alkyl group than that indicated. In addition where a substituent is designated as or can be hydrogen the exact chemical nature of a substituent which is other than hydrogen at that position for example a halogen hydroxy amino and the like functional group is not critical so long as it does not adversely affect the overall activity and or synthesis procedure. For example two hydroxyl groups two amino groups two thiol groups or a mixture of two hydrogen heteroatom groups on the same carbon are known not to be stable without protection or as a derivative.

Basic nitrogen containing groups may be quarternised with such agents as lower alkyl halide such as methyl ethyl propyl and butyl chlorides bromides and iodides dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl and diethyl sulfate and others.

In some embodiments the compounds disclosed herein such as the nucleosides and nucleotides also include the prodrug derivatives thereof which are covalently modified latent forms of the therapeutically active compound.

The term prodrug is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those compounds that when administered in a biological system are converted or activated in vivo to therapeutically active compounds by for example a spontaneous chemical reaction a metabolic chemical reaction an enzyme catalysed chemical reaction and or photolysis. Illustratively a prodrug can be activated either by cellular enzymes or by chemical cleavage such as hydrolysis to release liberate the nucleoside nucleotide or nucleotide mimic after the prodrug enters cells. Examples of prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidised reduced esterified deesterified alkylated dealkylated acylated deacylated aminated deaminated phosphorylated dephosphorylated photolyzed and or hydrolysed. Enzymes that may be capable of enzymatic conversion or activation of a prodrug to a therapeutically active compound include for example amidases cholinesterases esterases lipases nucleases oxidases phospholipases phosphases and or reductases. Such prodrug modification may improve or enhance for example drug absorption solubility lipophilicity bioavailability efficacy and or drug delivery into cells.

Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of the present disclosure may be prepared by modification of the sugar moiety or of the phosphate or phosphate mimic to include a prodrug substituent. A prodrug may also include a labile protecting group on the functional moiety or therapeutically active compound as described herein. In addition to those described herein prodrug derivatives of nucleosides nucleotides and nucleotide phosphate mimics and methods of making the prodrugs appropriate for use in the present disclosure are described inter alia in PCT Publications WO 2003 072757 and WO 2003 073989 and U.S. Patent application publication US20020361177.

Prodrugs are compounds that are pharmacologically inert but are converted by enzyme or chemical action to an active form of the drug i.e. an active pharmaceutical ingredient at or near the predetermined target site. In other words prodrugs are inactive compounds that yield an active compound upon metabolism in the body which may or may not be enzymatically controlled. Prodrugs may also be broadly classified into two groups bioprecursor and carrier prodrugs. Prodrugs may also be subclassified according to the nature of their action. Bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds that already contain the embryo of the active species within their structure whereby the active species are produced upon metabolism. For example the first prodrug antibacterial prontosil is metabolized in vivo to its active metabolite sulphanilamide. Carrier prodrugs are formed by combining the active drug with a carrier species forming a compound having desirable chemical and biological characteristics whereby the link is an ester or amide so that the carrier prodrug is easily metabolized upon absorption or delivery to the target site. For example lipophilic moieties may be incorporated to improve transport through membranes. Carrier prodrugs linked by a functional group to carrier are referred to as bipartate prodrugs. Prodrugs where the carrier is linked to the drug by a separate structure are referred to as tripartate prodrugs whereby the carrier is removed by an enzyme controlled metabolic process and whereby the linking structure is removed by an enzyme system or by a chemical reaction.

Illustratively when administered to a host a prodrug is generally administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug that is metabolised to form the therapeutically active compound and the prodrug moiety or substituent through for example hydrolysis or oxidation by enzymatic activity or by acid or base solvolysis. A prodrug moiety or prodrug substituent refers to the labile group that is removed from the therapeutically active compound through a metabolic hydrolytic and or enzymatic process. However non pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs also fall within the scope of the present disclosure and may be use used for example in in vitro assays to improve solubility and or as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs or other compounds.

Illustrative prodrugs moieties include but are not limited to residues of proteins antibiotics D and L amino acids which may be attached to a phosphate moiety or a phosphate mimic moiety via a carbon atom phosphonates a nitrogen atom phosphoamidates or an oxygen atom phosphoesters or may be attached to the sugar moiety through any one or more of the R Rgroups peptides preferably up to 10 amino acids attached to a phosphate moiety or a phosphate mimic moiety via a carbon atom phosphonates a nitrogen atom phosphoamidates or an oxygen atom phosphoesters or may be attached to the sugar moiety through any one or more of the R Rgroups drug moieties attached to a phosphate moiety or a phosphate mimic moiety via a carbon atom phosphonates a nitrogen atom phosphoamidates or an oxygen atom phosphoesters or may be attached to the sugar moiety through any one or more of the R Rgroups as well as including steroids vitamins polyamines carbohydrates polyethylene glycols PEGs cyclosaligenyls substituted 4 to 8 membered rings with or without heteroatom substitutions 1 3 phosphoamidate attachments to a terminal phosphate or phosphate mimic moiety or or connecting between an or of a phosphate moiety or phosphate mimic moiety and so on. Phosphoesters and phosphoamidates are particularly preferred prodrug moieties.

In one embodiment the prodrug of a nucleoside 5 mono phosphate mimic can mask the negative charges of the phosphate mimic moiety entirely or partially or mask the negative charges of the di phosphate mimic or tri phosphate mimic moiety or phosphate moiety in order to for example enhance drug absorption and or drug delivery into cells.

In another embodiment one or more prodrug substituents or moieties may be attached to one or more X X and X positions on a nucleoside mono phosphate mimic or to one or more X Xpositions on a nucleoside di or tri phosphate mimic. Illustrative prodrug substituents in positions X X or X position include 2 3 O diacylglyceryloxy 2 3 O dialkylglyceryloxy 1 O alkyl 2 O acylglyceryloxy 1 O acyl 2 O alkylglyceryloxy 1 S alkyl 2 O acyl 1 thioglyceryloxy acyloxymethoxy S acyl 2 thioethoxy S pivaloyl 2 thioethoxy acyloxymethoxy pivaloyloxymethoxy alkoxycarbonyloxymethoxy S alkyldithio S ethyoxy acyloxymethoxy S acyl 2 thioethoxy S pivaloyl 2 thioethoxy pivaloyloxymethoxy alkoxycarbonyloxymethoxy and S alkyldithio S ethyoxy.

In a further embodiment the prodrug substituent is a substituent on a hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety that is for instance any one of R R . Illustratively the modification results in the formation of an ester and in this regard the preferred prodrug substituents are C Cacyl groups for example acetyl propionyl pivaloyl etc. Also preferred are substituted C Cacyl moieties for example fluoroacetyl difluoroacetyl etc. More preferably the substituted C Cacyl group is represented as a residue of an L or D amino acid consisting of alanine asparagine cysteine glutamine glycine isoleucine leucine methionine phenylalanine proline serine threonine tryptophan tyrosine valine aspartic acid glutamic acid arginine histidine and lysine. Most preferably the prodrug substituent is an amino acid residue of D or L valine.

Alcohol is a good example of an ingredient that may be considered either active or inactive depending on the product formulation.

In addition to using prodrug approaches the delivery of the compounds described herein including the nucleosides and or nucleotides may be assisted by using a therapeutically acceptable carrier such as liposomal suspensions cationic lipids and polyimines.

The nucleosides of the present disclosure can be prepared by those who are skilled in synthetic organic and nucleoside chemistry using established synthetic methodology Vol. 1 2 3 edited by Townsend Plenum Press 2001by Yoshihisa Mizuno Elsevier 1986 . If required nucleosides of the present disclosure can be converted to their corresponding mono phosphate di phosphate and tri phosphate by established phosphorylation procedures.

The compounds described herein can also be converted into their corresponding mono phosphates di phosphates and tri phosphates using well established methods. Furthermore as discussed above prodrugs of mono phosphates di phosphates and tri phosphates can be prepared in order to optimise the biological efficacy of these phosphorylated compounds. Methods for preparing such prodrugs are well known in the art see for example Wagner C. R. et al. 2000 20 417 451 .

In Scheme B preferably A is O CH or optionally protected R R R R R R are each independently H halogen alkyl O alkyl OH optionally protected O or methyl and Base is as described herein.

In Scheme C preferably A is O CH or optionally protected N R R R R R R are each independently H halogen alkyl O alkyl OH optionally protected O methyl or F X is O S NH CF CHF CClH CBr or CHBr . Base is as described herein.

Compound 1 may be produced using methods generally known to those skilled in the art such as the procedures described in Helv. Chim. Acta vol. 78 p. 486 1995 and in U.S. Pat. No. 6 777 395. Briefly to Compound A HSOand MeOH were added and then chilled to 0 4 C. and NaH was added followed by DCBCl and DMF to render Compound B. To Compound B were added SnCland DCM after which the mixture was chilled to 3 C. and distilled HO added to render Compound C.

The compounds of the present disclosure may be tested for biological activity using well known procedures. For example antiviral assays may be conducted according to published widely used protocols. In order to obtain the therapeutic index compound induced cytotoxicity to host cells may also measured in parallel with antiviral activities. To determine the mode of action of antiviral nucleosides the corresponding nucleoside tri phosphates may be subjected to enzyme based assays for the inhibition of viral polymerases according to known protocols Ranjith Kumar et al. 2001 75 8615 Dhanak et al. 2002 277 38322 38327 . Some compounds of the present disclosure showed K values of less than 1 M against HCV NS5B.

Since the replicon RNA replication mimics the replication of HCV RNA in infected hepatocytes compounds that have the inhibitory effects in replicon assays are potentially useful as anti HCV drugs. The HCV replicon containing cell lines Randall and Rice 2001 14 743 may be used for the identification of potential anti HCV compounds. Among them is a widely used subgenomic replicon system developed by Lohmann et al. 1999 285 1102000 81 1631 2001 75 1437 2002 76 4008 . Some compounds of the present disclosure showed potent anti HCV activity with ECvalues of low M and below 1 M.

Immortalized cell lines derived from hepatocytes such as the Huh7 cells used in replicon containing cell lines are known to have diminished metabolic activity. Therefore the assessment of the intrahepatocyte levels of therapeutically active entities that are generated intracellularly by anabolic or catabolic processes requires assessment in primary hepatocytes. Some compounds of the present disclosure showed higher levels of intracellular triphosphate anabolite in primary hepatocytes compared with replicon containing cells.

Widely used protocols developed by Korba et al. 1992 19 55 and Pai et al. 1996 40 380 may be useful for the determination of in vitro anti HBV activity.

Anti HIV assays can be conducted according to the protocols developed by Schinazi et al. 1990 34 1061 1992 36 2423 1993 37 875 or other widely used protocols Kimpton et al. J. Virol. 1992 66 2232 Chan et al. 2001 44 1866 . Illustrative nucleoside tri phosphates of the present disclosure may act as potent inhibitors of the non structural position 5B NS5B which is HCV s RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Accordingly such compounds may be suited to treat HCV and or inhibit or prevent replication of HCV in a host. Also compounds of the present disclosure may exhibit profiles of activity and may provide the artisan with an alternative to treating viruses that exhibit drug resistance to conventional drugs. Other compounds of the present disclosure may also reduce toxicity and tolerability levels relative to existing therapies and those in development and or improve pharmacokinetic properties.

Accordingly nucleosides nucleotide nucleotide mimics and or their prodrugs of the present disclosure can be useful for the inhibition of a variety of enzymes including but not limited to DNA or RNA polymerases helicases ribonucleotide reductases protein kinases and telomerases and for the modulation of G proteins P2 purinergic receptors and the allosteric sites of a variety of enzymes. Illustratively the nucleosides nucleotides nucleotide mimics and or prodrugs of the present disclosure are used to treat viral infections caused by the RNA viruses of the group Flaviviridae and in particular HCV.

Also the nucleosides nucleotide mimics and or their prodrugs and derivatives thereof that display cytotoxicity to fast dividing cancer cells may be useful for the treatment of proliferative disorders including but not limited to lung cancer liver cancer prostate cancer colon cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer melanoma and leukemia.

As the ligands of P2 receptors and G proteins as well as the inhibitors of protein kinases the nucleosides nucleotides nucleotide mimics and or their prodrugs of the present disclosure may also be useful for the treatment of a wide range of other diseases and disorders such as inflammatory diseases autoimmune diseases Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

To address the issue of drug resistance combination therapies are widely used in the treatment of infectious diseases and or proliferative disorders. One or more nucleosides nucleotides nucleotide mimics prodrugs and or pharmaceutically acceptable salts esters solvates hydrates and prodrugs of the present disclosure may also be therapeutically administered as a single formulation such as a single tablet or a solution for injection with one or more chemical entities or alternatively may be administered in separate formulations in combination with one or more other active chemical entities to form a combination therapy. The other active chemical entities may include a small molecule a polypeptide and or a polynucleotide and combinations salts esters solvates hydrates and prodrugs and or other derivatives thereof. When administered as separate formulations the individual compounds may be co administered at substantially the same time for example administering two individual tablets or administered separately at different times and or at different frequencies. Illustratively the dose administered to a host for each compound is generally determined by the desired blood level concentration of drug over a predetermined amount of time to achieve a therapeutic affect in the host as know in the art and further described herein. For instance compounds of this disclosure may be useful when used in combination with other agents known to exert antiviral and or antiproliferative effect. For example combination with immunomodulatory antiviral agents such as an interferon and or an interferon derivative such as interferon alpha 2B such as Intron A interferon available from Schering Corp. Kenilworth N.J. pegylated interferon alpha 2A such as Pegasys available from Hoffmann LaRoche Nutley N.J. pegylated interferon alpha 2B such as Peg Intron available from Schering Corp. Kenilworth N.J. consensus interferon such as interferon alphacon 1 or Infergen available from Valeant Pharmaceuticals Costa Mesa Calif. interferon alpha 2A recombinant interferon alpha 2A such as Roferon interferon available from Hoffmann LaRoche Nutley N.J. or lymphoblastoid interferon tau and other large or small molecules known to modulate host immune responses may be beneficial in the treatment of a viral infection.

Similarly combinations of compounds of this disclosure with inosine mono phosphate dehydrogenase IMPDH inhibitors antiviral nucleosides and or antiviral non nucleosides could augment the activity of the nucleosides or nucleotides disclosed herein when administered alone. Other illustrative combinations useful in present disclosure include combinations with for example a cyclosporine such as cyclosporin A a cytokine such as interleukin 2 interleukin 6 or interleukin 12 a type 1 helper T cell response enhancer interfering RNA anti sense RNA an imidazoquinolone such as resimiquimod or Imiqimod an inosine 5 monophospate dehydrogenase inhibitor ribavirin amantadine rimantadine and or a metalloprotease serine protease polymerase or a helicase inhibitory agent and combinations thereof. In one embodiment one or more compounds of the present disclosure are used in combination with one or more compounds having anti HCV activity including for example a HCV helicase inhibitor a HCV metalloprotease inhibitor a HCV polymerase inhibitor a HCV NS4B protein inhibitor a HCV NS5A protein inhibitor a HCV serine protease inhibitor and or a HCV entry assembly or egress protein inhibitor.

The present disclosure also relates to kits or packages adapted for administration of the particular dosage regimen to ease mixing and or administration of a composition disclosed herein. Illustratively a month s supply of tablets can be packaged in a tablet dispenser such as a DIALPAK tablet dispenser supplied by Ortho Inc. which contains a dial member at the center of a circle that points to a day of the week so that when a pill is removed from the dispenser the dial can be rotated so that it points to the next day of the week. This design is intended to avoid the inadvertent taking of two pills in one day and is also designed to let the owner of the device know when a day has been skipped. A further illustration includes supplying a month s supply of powder that is packaged with a separate month s supply of diluent and a re usable plastic dosing cup. One skilled in the art will appreciate that such kits may contain many different variations of the above components such as for example kits that are packaged in a unit dose form or as daily weekly or yearly kits.

Another aspect of the present disclosure is a method of inhibiting the function of the HCV replicon by contacting the HCV replicon with a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt ester solvate hydrate or prodrug thereof.

Based upon the proceeding schemes and or procedures and the following Examples substituted pyrrolo triazines attached to a sugar moiety can be prepared by one skilled in the art using similar methods as shown in Table Nos. 1 and 2.

The MP 1 cells for the Cell Based HCV RNA Replication Luciferase Reporter Assay Protocol include a Huh 7 human hepatoma derived cell line that harbors a replicating RNA in the cytoplasm. This RNA termed a replicon encodes all of the HCV non structural proteins HCV NS2 to NS5B inclusively that catalyze the replication of the RNA replicon. Replicon copy number per cell is about 1000 to 5000. The replicon is stably maintained as an episome in dividing cells and therefore it is important to keep the cells in a sub confluent state and to ensure selection for the replicon by culturing the cells in medium supplemented with 0.25 mg ml G418. The entire structural region of the HCV genome is replaced with a neomycin resistance gene hence this cell line produces no infectious virus. Moreover the firefly luciferase gene is fused to the neogene with an FMDV 2A autoprocessing peptide that allows for expression of both mature luciferase and neomycin phosphotransferase from one cistron. Luciferase levels are directly proportional to the HCV RNA levels and the cell system allows for the evaluation of the potency of HCV inhibitors in cell culture.

The assay outline includes the following steps on Day 1 1 Plate cells at a density of 10 000 cells well of a 96 well plate and incubate 37 C. 2 Make compound dilutions 3 Add compound dilutions to cells 4 Incubate for 72 h. The assay includes the following steps on Day 4 1 Perform Cell titer blue assay for cytotoxicity the assay is based on the reduction of resazurin cell titer blue into a fluorescent product resorufin in metabolically active cells and the assay can be duplexed with the assay used for HCV replicon luciferase reporter assay 2 Perform luciferase assay with the Bright Glo luciferase substrate Promega and read luminescence 3 Process results.

Under this outline the cell culture includes MP 1 cells Huh7 cells maintaining an HCV subgenomic replicon containing the luciferase FMDV 2A neomycin phosphotransferase fusion gene . The MP 1 cells are maintained in Dulbecco s Modified Earle Medium DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS and 0.25 mg ml G418. The cells are passaged by trypsinization and frozen in 90 FBS 10 DMSO. During the assay the DMEM medium is supplemented with 10 FBS containing 0.5 DMSO and lacking G418.

Regarding cell plate preparation on the day of the assay MP 1 cells are trypsinised and diluted to obtain 5 000 10 000 cells 70 l in Assay Medium. Seventy l about 10 000 cells are distributed into each well of a black 96 well ViewPlate Packard . The plate is incubated at 37 C. in 5 COuntil compound addition.

Compound plates are prepared as follows 1 Add compound 20 mM in 100 DMSO to assay Medium lacking G418 to obtain a 60 M solution and a final DMSO concentration of 0.5 2 Sonicate for 15 min optional 3 Filter through a 0.22 m Millipore Filter Unit 96 well format optional 4 Prepare the final dilution plate in a Deep well titer plate in columns 3 to 11 add 400 l of Assay Medium containing 0.5 DMSO 5 Transfer 200 l of compound solution to column 3 of the dilution plate the highest concentration 2 is prepared in column 3 7 Prepare serial dilutions by transferring 200 l from column 3 to column 4 then from column 4 to column 5 serially through to column 11 no compound is included in column 12 .

The test compound is added to the cells by transferring 70 l from each well of the Compound Plate to a corresponding well of the Cell Plate three columns are used as the No inhibition control nine 9 columns are used for the nine point dose response . The cells are incubated at 37 C. 5 COfor 3 days.

Under the Alamar blue assay protocol the assay plates are removed from a 37 C. incubator and 20 l of CellTiter Blue Reagent is added. The cells are incubated in the 37 C. incubator for 3 h. The assay plates are shaken for 10 sec and fluorescence at 560 590nm is recorded. The results are expressed relative to the 100 untreated control using the following equation inhibition 100 RFU RFU RFU RFU 100 . Alternatively under the MTT protocol the extent of cytotoxicity is determined via metabolism of the vital dye 3 4 5 dimethylthiaxol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT . MTT 1 mg ml was added to each well and plates incubated for 3 hours incubation at 37 C. Wells were aspirated iso propanol 200 L was added and absorbance values read at 540 690 nm. Compound concentrations that developed 50 cytotoxicity CC were calculated using non linear regression analysis.

Under the Luciferase assay protocol the medium is aspirated from the Assay Plate and 50 l of 1 Glo Lysis Buffer Promega previously warmed to room temperature is added. Incubation occurs at room temperature for 10 min with occasional shaking. Black tape is placed at the bottom of the plate and 50 l of Bright Glo luciferase substrate Promega previously warmed to room temperature is added. Gentle mixing follows. A Packard Topcount instrument is then utilised using the following protocol Data Mode Luminescence CPS Count Delay 1 min Count time 2 sec. The luminescence determination CPS in each well of the culture plate is a measure of the amount of HCV RNA replication in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor. The inhibition is calculated with the following equation inhibition 100 CPS inhibitor CPS control 100 . A non linear curve fit with the Hill model is applied to the inhibition concentration data and the 50 effective concentrations EC are calculated using a computer curve fitting program. The biological properties of representative compounds of formula I shown below in Table No. 3 were investigated in the cell based HCV RNA replication luciferase reporter assay by way of the experimental protocol described above.

The HCV sub genomic replicon is selected in Huh 7 human hepatoma with G418 that maintains a replicating RNA episome in the cytoplasm of cells. HCV replicons that are resistant to a specific inhibitor of HCV RNA replication can be isolated using a dual combination of G418 and the specific inhibitor. In order to determine whether inhibitor resistant replicon RNA encodes for a stable mutation that confers resistance the replicon RNA can be isolated from the resistant cell line and serially passaged into na ve Huh 7 cells by electroporation. Following a new round of selection a cell population or cell line with the putative inhibitor resistant replicon can be phenotyped with the inhibitor to confirm that the resistant phenotype genetically maps to the replicon RNA.

The assay outline includes the following steps 1 Isolate cytoplasmic RNA Qiagen RNAeasy protocol 2 Transfect into na ve Huh 7 cells 3 Select colonies 3 4 weeks 4 Pick and expand colonies or establish pooled population of cells. In particular the total RNA is extracted from inhibitor resistant replicon containing Huh7 cells and cultured in a 10 cm tissue culture plate using an RNeasy Kit Qiagen as per the manufacturer s instructions. HCV replicon RNA copy number is determined by Taqman RT PCR analysis and generally 10 to 20 g of total cellular RNA that contains approximately 1 10copies of HCV RNA is transfected by electroporation into 8 10na ve Huh 7 cells. The transfected cells are subsequently cultured in 10 cm tissue culture plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum 10 FCS . Media are changed to DMEM 10 FCS supplemented with 0.25 mg ml G418 24 h after transfection and that is changed every three days. If required cells are passaged 1 3 to maintain the culture sub confluent. Visible colonies are formed three to four weeks post transfection and G418 selection. G418 resistant colonies may be picked and expanded into second generation cell lines or pooled into a population culture that constitutes the cells harboring serially passaged HCV Replicon RNA. The passage of mutations that are stable and confer resistance to a specific inhibitor are confirmed by measuring ECwith the second generation of replicon cells.

The NS5b chain termination assay uses stepwise addition of each nucleotide complementary to the overhang of a hairpin template with the first nucleotide radioactive i.e. the direct labelling method. If a test compound is a chain terminator the system is able to clearly show its incorporation into the chain and no further extension is observed.

Under this protocol the contents of two separate vials are prepared. Vial A contains 1.5 l 10 buffer 1.5 l enzyme 1.0 l oligo and 5.0 l for a total volume of approximately 9 l. Vial B contains NTPs of 6 l. The contents of Vial A is mixed with the contents of Vial B to provide a total volume of 15 followed by incubation at 30 C. for 60 min. The aliquot is mixed with RNA loading buffer heated at 70 C. for 15 min and run onto a 20 acrylamide gel with 7.2 M urea. The final concentration of NS5b is 1 M and the final concentration of NTP cpd is 2 M.

Poly r U RNA template Sigma is employed for the HCV NS5b polymerase inhibition assay using a NS5b 55 genotype 1b purified enzyme. The kinetic constant K is determined for the Poly r U template and ATP using a non linear least squares fit of initial rates as a function of substrate concentration assuming Michaelis Menten kinetics.

Standard RdRp assays consist of 20 g mL Poly r U RNA template and 100 nM HCV NS5b 55 genotype 1b in a 50 l reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris HCl 5 mM MgCl 5 mM MnCl 3 mM DTT 72 M ATP and 0.019 M P ATP. Elongation reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP and proceed for 60 min at 25 C. Reactions are quenched by the addition of 0.2 M EDTA and product formation is collected by filtration through Multiscreen plates Millipore . Quantification of product formation was performed using TopCount Perkin Elmer . The inhibitor concentration at which the enzyme catalysed rate is reduced by half IC is determined using a computer program for curve fitting. ICconcentrations for nucleoside 5 triphosphate compounds of the present disclosure are expected to range from 100 M. Under these conditions the ICfor Compound 25 is 0.37 m.

A modified method of the NS5b Polymerase inhibition assay was used to determine the Kand the mode of action for NS5b inhibitor compounds. The enzyme and template were fixed at 100 nM and 20 g mL and all other reaction conditions were identical to the NS5b polymerase inhibition assay. The velocity of NS5b reactions were monitored at different ATP and inhibitor concentrations. The ATP concentration ranged from 0.1 M to 1000 M and the concentration of the inhibitor ranged from 0.003 fold to 7 fold of the ICvalue. Velocities obtained at each ATP and inhibitor concentration were analysed using Graph Pad Prism to identify the mode of inhibition and Kfor inhibitor compounds. Under these conditions the Ki for Compound 25 is 0.08 M.

In vitro anabolism of Compound 9 in replicon cells and primary human hepatocytes produces the triphosphate species Compound 25. The structure of Compound 25 is

In vitro anabolism of Compound 9 and the intracellular accumulation of its triphosphate Compound 25 were studied in adherent Huh 7 and plated primary human hepatocytes. The Huh 7 human hepatoma liver cells JCRB0403 http cellbank.nibio.go.jp are maintained in DMEM containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS . Huh 7 cell clones carrying a HCV subgenomic replicon Lohmann et al. 1999. Science 285 110 113 are maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS and 0.25 mg ml G418. The cell lines are grown at 37 C. in a 5 CO 95 air atmosphere. Plated primary human hepatocytes 6 well Collagen No Overlay were purchased from Cellz Direct NC USA and maintained in InVitroGro Medium Celsis In Vitro Technologies MD USA under the same incubation conditions.

For intracellular anabolism studies Huh 7 cells are trypsinized harvested re suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS counted and seeded at a density of 0.7 10cells per well in a six well plate and incubated for a period of 24 hr at 37 C. in 5 COatmosphere. Media is removed and replaced with fresh DMEM 10 FBS containing 10 M Compound 9 for a period of 24 hr at 37 C. The cell monolayer is then quickly washed three times with drug free medium to remove extracellular Compound 9 and each well is incubated with fresh DMEM 10 FBS for a specified time period i.e. 6 wells at 0 2 4 8 24 and 48 hr . At the end of the incubation period the medium is aspirated from the well and the cell monolayer is washed with cold phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4. The washed cell monolayer is treated with 1.0 ml ice cold 70 methanol water scraped and harvested into a centrifuge tube and then sonicated for 1 min at 4 C. The resulting cell lysate is stored overnight at 80 C. and subsequently used to extract the metabolites of Compound 9. Isolation of Compound 9 and the intracellular metabolites of Compound 9 from plated primary human hepatocytes uses similar experimental conditions except that InVitroGro Medium is used as the cell culture medium.

Sample Analysis for intracellular nucleoside metabolites The cell lysate samples are thawed on ice and subjected to two freeze thaw cycles in a dry ice acetone bath. Cells extracts are vortexed and centrifuged at 16000 g for 5 min at 4 C. and 40 L of supernatant is injected for analysis using a API4000 triple quadrupole system. The Shimadzu LC autosampler is set at 4 C. to minimize evaporation. Compound 9 mono di and triphosphate Compound 25 are separated using a pH gradient on a Biobasic AX 3.0 50 mm column maintained at 40 C. The mobile phase consists of solvent A 10 mM ammonium acetate in 30 70 ACN H20 containing 0.008 glacial Acetic Acid and solvent B 1 mM ammonium acetate in 30 70 ACN H20 containing 0.225 ammonia hydroxide . The elution is performed using a linear gradient of buffer B from 10 to 100 in 2.5 minutes and then held under isocratic condition for 3.0 minutes at a composition of 100 B at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml minute. The mass spectrometer is operated in positive ion electrospray mode utilizing a multiple reaction monitoring scan functionality at m z m z 361.1 227.1 441.1 227.1 and 521.1 227.1 for Compound 9 mono di and triphosphate respectively. The respective metabolites are identified and quantified by comparing their chromatographic profiles and peak area response with those of authentic standards.

The pharmacokinetic properties of Compound 9 were determined in male Sprague Dawley rats beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys n 3 in each species with an oral dose of 5 mg kg and iv dose of 2 mg kg. PK parameters were analyzed using the WinNonlin noncompartmental model.

As shown in the Table No. 5 below following 24 hours incubation of Huh 7 HCV subgenomic replicon cells with 10 M initial concentration of Compound 9 the intracellular concentration of Compound 25 reached 5.7 mol million cells. Unexpectedly primary human hepatocytes generate much higher 60 fold intracellular levels of the triphosphate of Compound 9 under the same experimental conditions.

Compounds whose plasma half life is 2 hours and whose intracellular therapeutically active anabolite has a half life of 10 hours are expected to have a greater potential to be administered once daily therapeutically. The decay half life t of Compound 25 displays a biphasic profile in both replicon cells and primary human hepatocytes a rapid decay t 0.59 vs 3.4 hrs followed by a prolonged slow depletion with a t 38 hrs in both replicon cells and primary human hepatocytes.

As shown below in Table No. 6 cross species PK of Compound 9 showed an elimination t ranging 4 7.6 hours with a oral bioavailability of 33 96 . Based on these data it is expected that the plasma half life of Compound 9 in humans will be sufficient for it to be dosed once daily given the long intracellular half life of its triphosphate and its half lives in different animal species.
