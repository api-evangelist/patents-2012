This application is a U.S. national phase application under 35 U.S.C. 371 based upon International Application No. PCT US2012 020026 filed Jan. 3 2012 which claims the priority benefit of and is a continuation in part of U.S. Ser. No. 13 317 423 filed 17 Oct. 2011 which claims the priority benefit of U.S. Prov. Ser. No. 61 429 093 filed 31 Dec. 2010 each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

This patent specification relates to systems methods and related computer program products for the monitoring and control of energy consuming systems or other resource consuming systems. More particularly this patent specification relates to methods for encouraging energy efficient behaviors based on a network connected thermostat centric energy efficiency platform.

Substantial effort and attention continues toward the development of newer and more sustainable energy supplies. The conservation of energy by increased energy efficiency remains crucial to the world s energy future. According to an October 2010 report from the U.S. Department of Energy heating and cooling account for 56 of the energy use in a typical U.S. home making it the largest energy expense for most homes. Along with improvements in the physical plant associated with home heating and cooling e.g. improved insulation higher efficiency furnaces substantial increases in energy efficiency can be achieved by better control and regulation of home heating and cooling equipment. By activating heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC equipment for judiciously selected time intervals and carefully chosen operating levels substantial energy can be saved while at the same time keeping the living space suitably comfortable for its occupants.

It is beneficial at both a societal level and on a per home basis for a large number of homes to have their existing older thermostats replaced by newer microprocessor controlled intelligent thermostats having more advanced HVAC control capabilities that can save energy while also keeping the occupants comfortable. To do this these thermostats will need more information from the occupants as well as the environments where the thermostats are located. Preferably these thermostats will also be capable of connection to computer networks including both local area networks or other private networks and wide area networks such as the Internet or other public networks in order to obtain current and forecasted outside weather data cooperate in so called demand response programs e.g. automatic conformance with power alerts that may be issued by utility companies during periods of extreme weather enable users to have remote access and or control thereof through their network connected device e.g. smartphone tablet computer PC based web browser and other advanced functionalities that may require network connectivity.

Since settings made by the user such as setpoint temperatures have a great impact of energy savings it would be beneficial to encourage users to adopt increased energy saving behaviors and thermostat settings that are made possible with a network connected user friendly thermostat.

The above referenced patent applications are collectively referenced herein as the commonly assigned incorporated applications. 

A detailed description of the inventive body of work is provided herein. While several embodiments are described it should be understood that the inventive body of work is not limited to any one embodiment but instead encompasses numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents. In addition while numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the inventive body of work some embodiments can be practiced without some or all of these details. Moreover for the purpose of clarity certain technical material that is known in the related art has not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the inventive body of work.

As used herein the term HVAC includes systems providing both heating and cooling heating only cooling only as well as systems that provide other occupant comfort and or conditioning functionality such as humidification dehumidification and ventilation.

As used herein the terms power harvesting sharing and stealing when referring to HVAC thermostats all refer to the thermostat are designed to derive power from the power transformer through the equipment load without using a direct or common wire source directly from the transformer.

As used herein the term residential when referring to an HVAC system means a type of HVAC system that is suitable to heat cool and or otherwise condition the interior of a building that is primarily used as a single family dwelling. An example of a cooling system that would be considered residential would have a cooling capacity of less than about 5 tons of refrigeration 1 ton of refrigeration 12 000 Btu h .

As used herein the term light commercial when referring to an HVAC system means a type of HVAC system that is suitable to heat cool and or otherwise condition the interior of a building that is primarily used for commercial purposes but is of a size and construction that a residential HVAC system is considered suitable. An example of a cooling system that would be considered residential would have a cooling capacity of less than about 5 tons of refrigeration.

As used herein the term thermostat means a device or system for regulating parameters such as temperature and or humidity within at least a part of an enclosure. The term thermostat may include a control unit for a heating and or cooling system or a component part of a heater or air conditioner. As used herein the term thermostat can also refer generally to a versatile sensing and control unit VSCU unit that is configured and adapted to provide sophisticated customized energy saving HVAC control functionality while at the same time being visually appealing non intimidating elegant to behold and delightfully easy to use.

Some embodiments of thermostat in incorporate one or more sensors to gather data from the environment associated with enclosure . Sensors incorporated in thermostat may detect occupancy temperature light and other environmental conditions and influence the control and operation of HVAC system . Sensors incorporated within thermostat do not protrude from the surface of the thermostat thereby providing a sleek and elegant design that does not draw attention from the occupants in a house or other enclosure. As a result thermostat and readily fits with almost any d cor while adding to the overall appeal of the interior design.

As used herein a learning thermostat refers to a thermostat or one of plural communicating thermostats in a multi thermostat network having an ability to automatically establish and or modify at least one future setpoint in a heating and or cooling schedule based on at least one automatically sensed event and or at least one past or current user input. As used herein a primary thermostat refers to a thermostat that is electrically connected to actuate all or part of an HVAC system such as by virtue of electrical connection to HVAC control wires e.g. W G Y etc. leading to the HVAC system. As used herein an auxiliary thermostat refers to a thermostat that is not electrically connected to actuate an HVAC system but that otherwise contains at least one sensor and influences or facilitates primary thermostat control of an HVAC system by virtue of data communications with the primary thermostat. In one particularly useful scenario the thermostat is a primary learning thermostat and is wall mounted and connected to all of the HVAC control wires while the remote thermostat is an auxiliary learning thermostat positioned on a nightstand or dresser the auxiliary learning thermostat being similar in appearance and user interface features as the primary learning thermostat the auxiliary learning thermostat further having similar sensing capabilities e.g. temperature humidity motion ambient light proximity as the primary learning thermostat but the auxiliary learning thermostat not being connected to any of the HVAC wires. Although it is not connected to any HVAC wires the auxiliary learning thermostat wirelessly communicates with and cooperates with the primary learning thermostat for improved control of the HVAC system such as by providing additional temperature data at its respective location in the enclosure providing additional occupancy information providing an additional user interface for the user and so forth.

It is to be appreciated that while certain embodiments are particularly advantageous where the thermostat is a primary learning thermostat and the remote thermostat is an auxiliary learning thermostat the scope of the present teachings is not so limited. Thus for example while certain initial provisioning methods that automatically pair associate a network connected thermostat with an online user account are particularly advantageous where the thermostat is a primary learning thermostat the methods are more generally applicable to scenarios involving primary non learning thermostats auxiliary learning thermostats auxiliary non learning thermostats or other types of network connected thermostats and or network connected sensors. By way of further example while certain graphical user interfaces for remote control of a thermostat may be particularly advantageous where the thermostat is a primary learning thermostat the methods are more generally applicable to scenarios involving primary non learning thermostats auxiliary learning thermostats auxiliary non learning thermostats or other types of network connected thermostats and or network connected sensors. By way of even further example while certain methods for cooperative battery conserving information polling of a thermostat by a remote cloud based management server may be particularly advantageous where the thermostat is a primary learning thermostat the methods are more generally applicable to scenarios involving primary non learning thermostats auxiliary learning thermostats auxiliary non learning thermostats or other types of network connected thermostats and or network connected sensors.

Enclosure further includes a private network accessible both wirelessly and through wired connections and may also be referred to as a Local Area Network or LAN. Network devices on the private network include a computer thermostat and remote thermostat in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment the private network is implemented using an integrated router that provides routing wireless access point functionality firewall and multiple wired connection ports for connecting to various wired network devices such as computer . Other embodiments may instead use multiple discrete switches routers and other devices not shown to perform networking functions equivalent to or in addition to those provided by integrated router .

Integrated router further provides network devices access to a public network such as the Internet provided enclosure has a connection to the public network generally through a cable modem DSL modem and a service provider of the Internet or other public network. The Internet and other public networks are sometimes referred to as a Wide Area Network or WAN. In one embodiment integrated router may direct communications to other devices on these networks using a network protocol such as TCP IP. If the communications is directed to a device or service outside the private network integrated router may route the communications outside the private network to the public network such as the Internet.

In some embodiments thermostat may wirelessly communicate with remote thermostat over the private network or through an ad hoc network formed directly with remote thermostat . During communication with remote thermostat thermostat may gather information remotely from the user and from the environment detectable by the remote thermostat . For example remote thermostat may wirelessly communicate with the thermostat providing user input from the remote location of remote thermostat or may be used to display information to a user or both. Like thermostat embodiments of remote thermostat may also include sensors to gather data related to occupancy temperature light and other environmental conditions. In an alternate embodiment remote thermostat may also be located outside of the enclosure .

In accordance with some embodiments a computer device in enclosure may remotely control thermostat by accessing a thermostat management account through a thermostat management system not shown in located on a public network such as the Internet. The thermostat management system passes control information over the network back to thermostat provided the thermostat is also associated or paired to the thermostat management account on the thermostat management system. Data collected by thermostat also passes from the private network associated with enclosure through integrated router and to the thermostat management system over the public network. Other computer devices not in enclosure such as Smartphones laptops and tablet computers not shown in may also control thermostat provided they have access to the public network and both the thermostat management system and thermostat management account. Further details on accessing the public network such as the Internet and a thermostat like thermostat in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is described in further detail later herein.

In heating heating coils or elements within air handler provide a source of heat using electricity or gas via line . Cool air is drawn from the enclosure via return air duct through filter using fan and is heated through heating coils or elements . The heated air flows back into the enclosure at one or more locations via supply air duct system and supply air registers such as register . In cooling an outside compressor passes a gas such as Freon through a set of heat exchanger coils to cool the gas. The gas then goes through line to the cooling coils in the air handler where it expands cools and cools the air being circulated via fan . A humidifier may optionally be included in various embodiments that returns moisture to the air before it passes through duct system . Although not shown in alternate embodiments of HVAC system may have other functionality such as venting air to and from the outside one or more dampers to control airflow within the duct system and an emergency heating unit. Overall operation of HVAC system is selectively actuated by control electronics communicating with thermostat over control wires .

Although being formed from a single lens like piece of material such as polycarbonate the cover has two different regions or portions including an outer portion and a central portion . According to some embodiments the cover is painted or smoked around the outer portion but leaves the central portion visibly clear so as to facilitate viewing of an electronic display disposed thereunderneath. According to some embodiments the curved cover acts as a lens that tends to magnify the information being displayed in electronic display to users. According to some embodiments the central electronic display is a dot matrix layout individually addressable such that arbitrary shapes can be generated rather than being a segmented layout. According to some embodiments a combination of dot matrix layout and segmented layout is employed. According to some embodiments central display is a backlit color liquid crystal display LCD . An example of information displayed on the electronic display is illustrated in and includes central numerals that are representative of a current setpoint temperature. According to some embodiments metallic portion has number of slot like openings so as to facilitate the use of a passive infrared motion sensor mounted therebeneath. The metallic portion can alternatively be termed a metallic front grille portion. Further description of the metallic portion front grille portion is provided in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108 supra. The thermostat is preferably constructed such that the electronic display is at a fixed orientation and does not rotate with the outer ring so that the electronic display remains easily read by the user. For some embodiments the cover and metallic portion also remain at a fixed orientation and do not rotate with the outer ring . According to one embodiment in which the diameter of the thermostat is about 80 mm the diameter of the electronic display is about 45 mm. According to some embodiments an LED indicator is positioned beneath portion to act as a low power consuming indicator of certain status conditions. For example the LED indicator can be used to display blinking red when a rechargeable battery of the thermostat see infra is very low and is being recharged. More generally the LED indicator can be used for communicating one or more status codes or error codes by virtue of red color green color various combinations of red and green various different blinking rates and so forth which can be useful for troubleshooting purposes.

Motion sensing as well as other techniques can be use used in the detection and or predict of occupancy as is described further in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 430 supra. According to some embodiments occupancy information is used in generating an effective and efficient scheduled program. Preferably an active proximity sensor A is provided to detect an approaching user by infrared light reflection and an ambient light sensor B is provided to sense visible light. The proximity sensor A can be used to detect proximity in the range of about one meter so that the thermostat can initiate waking up when the user is approaching the thermostat and prior to the user touching the thermostat. Such use of proximity sensing is useful for enhancing the user experience by being ready for interaction as soon as or very soon after the user is ready to interact with the thermostat. Further the wake up on proximity functionality also allows for energy savings within the thermostat by sleeping when no user interaction is taking place our about to take place. The ambient light sensor B can be used for a variety of intelligence gathering purposes such as for facilitating confirmation of occupancy when sharp rising or falling edges are detected because it is likely that there are occupants who are turning the lights on and off and such as for detecting long term e.g. 24 hour patterns of ambient light intensity for confirming and or automatically establishing the time of day.

According to some embodiments for the combined purposes of inspiring user confidence and further promoting visual and functional elegance the thermostat is controlled by only two types of user input the first being a rotation of the outer ring as shown in referenced hereafter as a rotate ring or ring rotation input and the second being an inward push on an outer cap see until an audible and or tactile click occurs referenced hereafter as an inward click or simply click input . For the embodiment of the outer cap is an assembly that includes all of the outer ring cover electronic display and metallic portion . When pressed inwardly by the user the outer cap travels inwardly by a small amount such as 0.5 mm against an interior metallic dome switch not shown and then springably travels back outwardly by that same amount when the inward pressure is released providing a satisfying tactile click sensation to the user s hand along with a corresponding gentle audible clicking sound. Thus for the embodiment of an inward click can be achieved by direct pressing on the outer ring itself or by indirect pressing of the outer ring by virtue of providing inward pressure on the cover metallic portion or by various combinations thereof. For other embodiments the thermostat can be mechanically configured such that only the outer ring travels inwardly for the inward click input while the cover and metallic portion remain motionless. It is to be appreciated that a variety of different selections and combinations of the particular mechanical elements that will travel inwardly to achieve the inward click input are within the scope of the present teachings whether it be the outer ring itself some part of the cover or some combination thereof. However it has been found particularly advantageous to provide the user with an ability to quickly go back and forth between registering ring rotations and inward clicks with a single hand and with minimal amount of time and effort involved and so the ability to provide an inward click directly by pressing the outer ring has been found particularly advantageous since the user s fingers do not need to be lifted out of contact with the device or slid along its surface in order to go between ring rotations and inward clicks. Moreover by virtue of the strategic placement of the electronic display centrally inside the rotatable ring a further advantage is provided in that the user can naturally focus their attention on the electronic display throughout the input process right in the middle of where their hand is performing its functions. The combination of intuitive outer ring rotation especially as applied to but not limited to the changing of a thermostat s setpoint temperature conveniently folded together with the satisfying physical sensation of inward clicking together with accommodating natural focus on the electronic display in the central midst of their fingers activity adds significantly to an intuitive seamless and downright fun user experience. Further descriptions of advantageous mechanical user interfaces and related designs which are employed according to some embodiments can be found in U.S. Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra U.S. Ser. No. 29 386 021 supra and U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108 supra.

According to some embodiments the thermostat includes a processing system display driver and a wireless communications system . The processing system is adapted to cause the display driver and display area to display information to the user and to receiver user input via the rotatable ring . The processing system according to some embodiments is capable of carrying out the governance of the operation of thermostat including the user interface features described herein. The processing system is further programmed and configured to carry out other operations as described further hereinbelow and or in other ones of the commonly assigned incorporated applications. For example processing system is further programmed and configured to maintain and update a thermodynamic model for the enclosure in which the HVAC system is installed such as described in U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 463 supra and in International Patent App. No. PCT US11 51579 incorporated herein by reference. According to some embodiments the wireless communications system is used to communicate with devices such as personal computers and or other thermostats or HVAC system components which can be peer to peer communications communications through one or more servers located on a private network or and or communications through a cloud based service.

Backplate includes electronics and a temperature humidity sensor in housing which are ventilated via vents . Two or more temperature sensors not shown are also located in the head unit and cooperate to acquire reliable and accurate room temperature data. Wire connectors are provided to allow for connection to HVAC system wires. Connection terminal provides electrical connections between the head unit and backplate . Backplate electronics also includes power sharing circuitry for sensing and harvesting power available power from the HVAC system circuitry.

The embodiments described herein are advantageously configured to be compatible with a large variety of conventional integrated routers that service a large population of homes and businesses. Thus by way of example only and not by way of limitation the router not shown that services the private network of can be for example a D Link DIR 655 Extreme N Wireless Router a Netgear WNDR3700 RangeMax Dual Band Wireless USB Gigabit Router a Buffalo Technology Nfiniti WZR HP G300NH Wireless N Router an Asus RT N16 Wireless Router Cisco Linksys E4200 Dual Band Wireless Router or a Cisco Linksys E4200 Dual Band Wireless Router. Without loss of generality some descriptions further hereinbelow will refer to an exemplary scenario in which the thermostats are used in a home environment. However it is to be appreciated that the described embodiments are not so limited and are applicable to use of such thermostat s in any of a variety of enclosures including residential homes business vacation homes hotels hotel rooms industrial facilities and generally anywhere there is an HVAC system to be controlled.

Thermostat access client is a client application designed in accordance with aspects of the present invention to access the thermostat management system over public network . The term thermostat management system can be interchangeably referenced as a cloud based management server for the thermostats or more simply cloud server in various descriptions hereinabove and hereinbelow. Because thermostat access client is designed to execute on different devices multiple client applications may be developed using different technologies based on the requirements of the underlying device platform or operating system. For some embodiments thermostat access client is implemented such that end users operate their Internet accessible devices e.g. desktop computers notebook computers Internet enabled mobile devices cellphones having rendering engines or the like that are capable of accessing and interacting with the thermostat management system . The end user machine or device has a web browser e.g. Internet Explorer Firefox Chrome Safari or other rendering engine that typically is compatible with AJAX technologies e.g. XHTML XML CSS DOM JSON and the like . AJAX technologies include XHTML Extensible HTML and CSS Cascading Style Sheets for marking up and styling information the use of DOM Document Object Model accessed with client side scripting languages the use of an XMLHttpRequest object an API used by a scripting language to transfer XML and other text data asynchronously to and from a server using HTTP and use of XML or JSON Javascript Object Notation a lightweight data interchange format as a format to transfer data between the server and the client. In a web environment an end user accesses the site in the usual manner i.e. by opening the browser to a URL associated with a service provider domain. The user may authenticate to the site or some portion thereof by entry of a username and password. The connection between the end user entity machine and the system may be private e.g. via SSL . The server side of the system may comprise conventional hosting components such as IP switches web servers application servers administration servers databases and the like. Where AJAX is used on the client side client side code an AJAX shim executes natively in the end user s web browser or other rendering engine. Typically this code is served to the client machine when the end user accesses the site although in the alternative it may be resident on the client machine persistently. Finally while a web based application over Internet Protocol IP is described this is not a limitation as the techniques and exposed user interface technologies may be provided by a standalone application in any runtime application whether fixed line or mobile. It is to be appreciated that although the TCP IP protocol is set forth as the network protocol used for communications among the thermostat management system the thermostat access client and other devices for some embodiments it is set forth by way of example and not by way of limitation with the use of any other suitable protocol such as UDP over IP in particular may be used without departing from the scope of the present teachings.

In yet another embodiment thermostat access client may be a stand alone application or app designed to be downloaded and run on a specific device such as smartphone or a tablet device running the Apple iOS operating system Android operating system or others. Developers create these stand alone applications using a set of application programming interfaces APIs and libraries provided by the device manufacturer packaged in software development toolkit or SDK.

In some embodiments the thermostat management servers making up this thermostat management system may manage thermostats located in multiple enclosures across various geographic locations and time zones. Each enclosure may use one or several thermostats in accordance with embodiments of the present invention to control one or several HVAC systems such as HVAC system in . In some cases there may be an increased need from the thermostat management system for certain functions and therefore more servers to deliver these functional capabilities. It may be appreciated that the design of thermostat management system and use of the thermostat management servers may be scaled to meet these demands on the system and efficiently track and organize the data from these multiple enclosures and thermostats for processing analysis control and machine learning purposes.

One embodiment of registration server provides a number of services related to registering a thermostat on the thermostat management system and preparing it for pairing with a thermostat management account. In operation the registration server may be first accessed by a thermostat when the thermostat is wired to the HVAC of an enclosure and then connected to the Internet through a private network. To make the thermostat known on system the thermostat sends thermostat metadata from the private network to the public network such as the Internet and then onto processing by registration server . Preferably the thermostat metadata includes a unique thermostat identifier such as one that is assigned at the time of manufacturing. As the communication that sends the thermostat metadata passes through the network address translator NAT of the router not shown that serves the associated private network it is appended with the public network address of that router which is thus the public address that is used by the thermostat to communicate over the public network. The thermostat identifier is used to identify the thermostat from other thermostats being registered by registration server and may be based in part or in whole on a media access control MAC address assigned to the NIC of the thermostat. As one security measure against registering unauthorized devices registration server may compare the MAC address in the thermostat metadata against a list of valid MAC addresses provided by the manufacturer of the thermostat or NIC component. In accordance with one embodiment the thermostat registration is complete when the registration server provisions an entry in a thermostat registration pool and marks the thermostat entry ready to be paired with a thermostat management account. Entries in the thermostat registration pool may be referenced by their unique thermostat identifier the public network address that they used or more particularly the public address of the private network router through which they connect to the Internet and optionally other relevant metadata associated with the thermostat.

In some embodiments update server attempts to update software firmware and configuration updates to each of the thermostats registered in the thermostat registration pool. If metadata from entries in the registration pool exclude versioning information update server may need to further query each thermostat for current versions installed. Update server may access entries in the registration pool and then use corresponding network addresses in each entry to connect to the associated thermostat over the public network or private network or both.

If newer software versions exist than currently used on a thermostat update server proceeds to send software updates to the thermostat over the public network. For example update server may use file transfer protocols such as ftp file transfer protocol tftp trivial file transfer protocol or more secure transfer protocols when uploading the new software. Once uploaded installation and update of the software on the thermostat may occur immediately through an auto update option on the thermostat or manually through the interface of the thermostat as requested by a user.

One embodiment of pairing server facilitates the association or pairing of a thermostat with a thermostat management account on thermostat management account server . The term thermostat management account can be used interchangeably with user account herein unless specified otherwise. Once the thermostat is paired with a user account a rich variety of network enabled capabilities are enabled as described further herein and in one or more of the commonly assigned incorporated applications supra. For example once pairing has been achieved a person with access to the thermostat management account may access the thermostat through the thermostat management system using the thermostat access client for a variety of purposes such as seeing the current temperature of the home changing the current setpoint changing the mode of the thermostat between home and away and so forth. Moreover the thermostat management system can then start tracking the various information provided by the thermostat which in turn enables a rich variety of cloud based data aggregation and analysis that can be used to provide relevant reports summaries updates and recommendations to the user either through the thermostat display itself through the thermostat access client or both. A variety of other capabilities such as demand response actions in which the thermostat management server sends an energy alert and or sends energy saving setpoint commands to the thermostats of users who have enrolled in such programs can be carried out.

In view of the importance of establishing a pairing between the thermostat and a thermostat management account there is provided an ability for a fallback method of pairing which can be termed a manually assisted method of pairing that can take effect and be carried out in the event that the convenient auto pairing methods described further hereinbelow cannot be securely and reliably carried out for a particular installation. The manually assisted method may use an alphanumeric passcode to pair the thermostat to the thermostat management account. Typically the passcode is sent to the thermostat over a public network like the Internet and displayed on the display area of the thermostat. Authorization to access the thermostat is provided if the user obtaining the passcode from the display on the thermostat then enters it into a pairing dialog presented when the user logs into their thermostat management account. Pairing server pairs the thermostat with the user s thermostat management account if the user enters that same passcode that was displayed on their thermostat display.

According to a preferred auto pairing method the pairing server may automatically pair or auto pair a thermostat management account to a thermostat if both are located on the same private network. If the thermostat and thermostat management account are associated with the same private network embodiments of the present invention presume the thermostat is at the user s home office or other area where the user should also have control of the device. To make this determination automatically the pairing server compares the public network address that was used to register the thermostat over the Internet with the public network address used by the computer device that has most recently been used to access the thermostat management account. Since the thermostat and computer device only have private network addresses the router on the private network they share inserts the same public network address into their packets thus allowing the two devices to access servers services and other devices on the Internet. Auto pairing takes advantage of this fact and automatically pairs devices sharing the same public network address. This is particularly advantageous from a user standpoint in that the user is not bothered with the need to enter a passcode or other alphanumerical identifier in order to achieve the pairing process and avoids the concern that a user may inadvertently enter incorrect codes or identifiers into the system. Details on auto pairing and manually assisted pairing are described in further detail later herein.

Thermostat front end user interface UI server facilitates the generation and presentation of intuitive user friendly graphical user interfaces that allow users to remotely access configure interact with and control one or more of their network connected thermostats from a computer web browser smartphone tablet or other computing device. The user friendly graphical user interfaces can also provide useful tools and interfaces that do not necessarily require real time connectivity with the thermostats with examples including for some embodiments providing user interfaces for displaying historical energy usage historical sensor readings and or occupancy patterns allowing the user to learn about and or enroll in demand response programs provide social networking forums that allow users to interact with each other in informative competitive fun ways that promote energy savings provide access to local information including weather public safety information neighborhood calendar events and local blogs and more generally provide services and information associated with a comprehensive energy portal functionality. Examples of intuitive user friendly graphical user interfaces provided by the UI server according to one or more preferred embodiments are described further in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 317 423.

In some embodiments a thermostat access client user interface displays an image of a house representing a primary enclosure paired to the thermostat management account in the thermostat management system. Thermostat front end UI server may further instruct the thermostat access client such as thermostat access client in to display images visually representative of one or more thermostats inside the primary enclosure. By default each of the one or more thermostat images may also display a current temperature measurement in the enclosure. In some embodiments the user interface may also further display an image of an additional house or houses representing a secondary enclosure having additional thermostats that are also paired to the thermostat management account. The image of the additional house may appear smaller out of focus or generally deemphasized visually in relationship to the image of the house representing the primary enclosure. Additional enclosures beyond the secondary enclosure can also be displayed in the user interface and should also appear visually deemphasized compared with the image displayed for the primary enclosure. Further information on the thermostat access client and user interface are described in more detail in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 317 423.

Thermostat backend server manages the storage of data used by various thermostat management servers in the thermostat management system . In some embodiments thermostat backend server may manage storage of the thermostat registration pool data used by the registration server or may organize and store new software updates and releases for the update server . In another embodiment thermostat backend server may also store heating and cooling related data i.e. date and time HVAC system was in either heating or cooling mode within the enclosure sensor information battery level data alarms etc. associated with an enclosure that was sent to the thermostat management system by thermostats registered therewith and in some embodiments and provide pre computed heating and cooling schedules applications and other data for download over the public network for use by the thermostats.

In some embodiments thermostat management account server is used to create new accounts and update existing accounts on thermostat management system . To access their thermostat over a thermostat access client and enjoy the benefits of thermostat connectedness the user is first required to create of a thermostat management account user account on thermostat management account server using their thermostat access client . Accordingly users execute the thermostat access client on a computer or other computer device to access the thermostat management account server . The thermostat management account server should receive at least the zip code and or city and state for the enclosure in which the thermostat is or will be installed such that weather information provided by a weather service can be accessed and downloaded to the thermostat which can be used as part of its optimal enclosure characterization and HVAC control algorithms. Optionally a variety of other information including a user s contact information enclosure street addresses and so forth can also be received. Primary options associated with the thermostat management account server include pairing one or more thermostats to the correct thermostat management account through pairing operations provided by pairing server . However even if the account is not yet paired with a thermostat the user may use the thermostat management account to access local information including weather public safety information neighborhood calendar events local blogs and more information based upon the user s contact information locale and other interests.

According to some embodiments one or more of the household systems or devices connected or linked to thermostat are compatible under license or other business arrangement with the thermostat unit manufacturer and or thermostat data service provider. According to some embodiments the thermostat functional as central energy hub for the whole house. Especially for a residential context it has been found that thermostat is an advantageous way to instantiate such a home energy network at least because virtually all homes need to have a thermostat anyway. Once the thermostat is installed by replacement of an old thermostat as part of new construction etc. and connected or paired such as via local network public network and or thermostat management system shown in it can effectively serve as the core for such a network. In this sense a relatively seamless transition for most residences to the concept of a home energy network is provided in that there is no extra hardware needed to be installed plugged in updated and maintained and likewise no need to have an always on home computer loaded with an additional software that in turn needs to be updated and maintained . Instead the thermostat centric home energy network is simply achieved by upgrading a home s old thermostat to the visually pleasing easy to use thermostat . The various features and user interfaces of the thermostat centric home energy network can be provided directly to the user s existing smartphones tablets browsers by virtue of the cloud based thermostat management system . At the user s own pace of implementation which can correspond to natural product upgrade or replacement cycles new devices such as those shown in can be purchased and or modified to contain a Wi Fi and or ZigBee communication capability and configured to communicate with the thermostat which can then upload the various data to the cloud server and can further receive and distribute control instructions from the cloud server to the various end devices. This can lead to one or more of the following exemplary advantageous uses. For example using wireless communications the thermostat unit can communicate with the dishwasher or the refrigerator . If the user walks up to the dishwasher and attempts to start it there can be a display on the dishwasher that says Would you like to start the load now for 1 or wait until 2 AM and do the load for 20 cents The thermostat serves and the conduit and core for such a platform. In one example of many advantages with occupancy sensing the thermostat can sense when the occupants are not home and automatically command the refrigerator to turn up its set point by 2 degrees and then command it to return to normal after the thermostat has sensed that the occupants have returned. Similar functionalities can be provided in conjunction with any hot water heaters hot tubs or pool heaters and so forth that are equipped and licensed to be compatible with the thermostat . In another example occupancy information from thermostat is used to manage outlets and lights for both intra day and inter day periods of non occupancy. For inter day periods for example the lights and certain outlets are controlled so as to provide for the appearance of occupancy to inexpensively and effectively increase home security. In another example weather climate temperature humidity and or dew point solar output precipitation and or wind information that may be gathered already as part of the operation of thermostat for example from thermostat management system is used for improving energy and or resource efficiency of sprinkler system hot tub spa or pools heating system and solar power array . In a simple example timing and watering days are adjusted due to forecast or detected rain and or high temperatures. In another example hot tub spa or pool heating system is also controlled according to occupancy information from thermostat such as by reducing heating during long periods of non occupancy and or increasing heating during expected or detected occupancy or occupant arrivals. In another example occupancy sensor information from thermostat is used to supplement and increase the accuracy and reliability of home alarm system . In another example occupancy information from thermostat is used to facilitate computer related tasks on computer that maybe more efficient or less intrusive to carry out when the home is unoccupied such as large data backups software updates and maintenance such as disk defragmentation. In another example occupancy and or installation information from thermostat such as weather the building is a home or business can be used to adjust sensitivity to smoke detectors and or carbon monoxide detectors so as to increase effectiveness while decreasing false alarms. In another example water heater is adjusted to save energy during long periods of non occupancy as determined by thermostat . According to some embodiments the thermostat is works in connection with other home automation control systems such as INSTEON plug in controllers for dimmers lights outlets sprinklers etc. For some cases the thermostat can achieve this control by virtue of programs and data that are stored at the thermostat itself optionally as updated by the cloud server as needed while for other cases the thermostat will be more of a communications conduit for data uptake to the cloud server and transmission of decisions made at the cloud server to the various network devices.

According to some embodiments thermostat is used in connection with video game console and or computer to encourage adoption of energy efficient behavior through the use of competition game related incentive or rewards and or exchange of thermostat related settings or algorithms with other users.

According to some embodiments an SPM is based only on the percentage of time that their HVAC system is cycled on on time percentage or OTP wherein the performance metric is higher better when the on time percentage is lower. For other embodiments the user s energy saving performance is measured only by virtue of physical parameters that can be sensed or governed by the thermostats themselves in combination with weather information that can be readily accessed based on the user s geographical information such as ZIP code. For these embodiments the standalone performance metric preferably is modified to take into account the outside weather such as the outside temperature.

According to some other embodiments the performance metrics can be more complex including both HVAC performance and other energy performance metrics such as can be acquired from homes with smart meters connected to the cloud.

The sharing of settings and algorithms may be particularly useful among members of a specific demographic. For example swing non standard shift workers may benefit from adopting a program setpoint schedule that more accurately reflects their occupancy and sleep patterns. In another example swing non standard shift workers may benefit from occupancy algorithms that are more sensitive to occupancy detection during the nighttime. An example of such an algorithm may include decreasing the number of consecutive buckets of PIR sensor activity needed to activate an auto away and or auto arrival. For further details of thermostat sensing systems see co pending International Patent Application No. PCT US11 61479 supra. For further details of auto away and auto arrival algorithms see co pending International Patent Application No. PCT US11 61437 supra. Another example of types of algorithms that might be shared among thermostat owners relates to detection of the activity of household pets. In some cases for example in mild climates it may be useful for the auto away and auto arrival algorithms to ignore the detection of pets while in more extreme climates it may be useful not to ignore pets. Certain settings and or algorithms may further be suited to households with large or small pets for example settings relating to the PIR sensor angle of sensitivity may be set differently to ignore or detect occupancy and or activity of certain sizes of pets. In another example a first user may post a particular algorithm or setting for review by others. Other thermostat users may review the efficacy of algorithm or setting or even suggest changes. Yet other thermostat users may decide to adopt the posted algorithm or setting depending on such reviews.

In step a first user refines settings and or algorithms in his or her thermostat. In step the first user uploads the settings and or algorithms to a database such as database shown in . In step the first user notifies others of the settings and or algorithms. In some examples this notification is via a third party service such as social networking service shown in . In other examples the notification is through a the thermostat access client and thermostat management services and potentially in the form of a forum or bulletin board accessible by registered users of network connected thermostats. In step a second user sees the first user s notification and decides to adopt the first user s uploaded settings or algorithms. In step the second user downloads the settings and or algorithms to his or her thermostat. In step the second user after using the downloaded settings and or algorithms for some time offers comments ratings or other feedback. In some examples the feedback is posted publicly for other to see. In step a third user views second user s feedback and based on it decides to download the settings and or algorithms. In some examples the first user may modify the settings and or algorithms in response to the second user s feedback thereby improving the settings and or algorithms. In some examples users are asked to rate the shared material on a ratings scale of one to five stars and other users may indicate whether or not they found another s review to be helpful.

Various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Indeed various user interfaces for operating thermostats HVACSs and other devices have been provided yet the designs are meant to be illustrative and not limiting as to the scope of the overall invention. While methods and systems have been described for pairing thermostats using autopairing and passcode pairing it is contemplated that these methods and system may be applied to any device on a private network attempting to pair with an account. For example embodiments of the present invention are not limited to network attached thermostats but any device connected to a network such as set top boxes streaming server devices streaming service applications computers mobile phones voice over IP phones or anything that might benefit from an autopairing function in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. It is to be further appreciated that the term thermostat as used hereinabove and hereinbelow can include thermostats having direct control wires to an HVAC system and can further include thermostats that do not connect directly with the HVAC system but that sense an ambient temperature at one location in an enclosure and cooperatively communicate by wired or wireless data connections with a separate thermostat unit located elsewhere in the enclosure wherein the separate thermostat unit does have direct control wires to the HVAC system. Accordingly the invention is not limited to the above described embodiments but instead is defined by the appended claims in light of their full scope of equivalents.
