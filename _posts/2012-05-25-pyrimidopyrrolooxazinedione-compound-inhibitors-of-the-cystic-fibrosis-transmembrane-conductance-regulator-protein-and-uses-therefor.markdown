This application is a U.S. national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Patent Application PCT US2012 039715 accorded an international filing date of May 25 2012 which claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 491 151 filed May 27 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers DK86125 DK72517 HL73856 EP00415 DK35124 and EY13574 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.

Therapeutics are needed for treating diseases and disorders related to aberrant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein CFTR mediated ion transport such as polycystic kidney disease increased intestinal fluid secretion and secretory diarrhea. Small molecule compounds are described herein that are potent inhibitors of CFTR activity and may be used for treating such diseases and disorders.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein CFTR is a cAMP activated chloride Cl channel expressed in epithelial cells in mammalian airways intestine pancreas and testis see e.g. Sheppard et al. 79 S23 45 1999 Gadsby et al. 40 477 83 2006 . Hormones such as a adrenergic agonist or a toxin such as cholera toxin lead to an increase in cAMP activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase and phosphorylation of the CFTR Cl channel which causes the channel to open. An increase in cell Ca can also activate different apical membrane channels. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C can either open or shut Cl channels in the apical membrane. CFTR is predominantly located in epithelia where it provides a pathway for the movement of Cl ions across the apical membrane and a key point at which to regulate the rate of transepithelial salt and water transport.

CFTR chloride channel function is associated with a wide spectrum of disease including cystic fibrosis CF and with polycystic kidney disease secretory diarrhea and some forms of male infertility. Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary lethal disease caused by mutations in CFTR see e.g. Quinton 79 S3 S22 1999 Boucher 23 146 58 2004 . Observations in human patients with CF and mouse models of CF indicate the functional importance of CFTR in intestinal and pancreatic fluid transport as well as in male fertility see e.g. Grubb et al. 79 S193 S214 1999 Wong 4 107 110 1997 . CFTR is also expressed in enterocytes in the intestine and in cyst epithelium in polycystic kidney disease see e.g. O Sullivan et al. 32 976 983 1998 Sullivan et al. 78 1165 91 1998 Strong et al. 93 347 54 1994 Mall et al. 126 32 41 2004 Hanaoka et al. 270 C389 C399 1996 Kunzelmann et al. 82 245 289 2002 Davidow et al. 50 208 18 1996 Li et al. 66 1926 38 2004 Al Awqati 110 1599 1601 2002 Thiagarajah et al. 3 594 99 2003 .

Polycystic kidney disease PKD is one of the most common human genetic diseases and a major cause of chronic renal insufficiency requiring dialysis and kidney transplantation see e.g. Torres et al. 369 1287 301 2007 . Cyst growth in PKD involves fluid secretion into the cyst lumen coupled with epithelial cell hyperplasia. PKD is characterized by massive enlargement of fluid filled cysts of renal tubular origin that compromise normal renal parenchyma and cause renal failure see e.g. Arnaout 52 93 123 2001 Gabow 329 332 342 1993 Harris et al. 81 75 85 2004 Wilson 350 151 164 2004 Sweeney et al. 326 671 685 2006 Chapman 18 1399 1407 2007 . Human autosomal dominant PKD ADPKD is caused by mutations in one of two genes PKD1 and PKD2 encoding the interacting proteins polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 respectively see e.g. Wilson supra Qian et al. 87 979 987 1996 Wu et al. 93 177 88 1998 Watnick et al. Torres et al. 10 363 364 2004 25 143 44 2000 .

Cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ADPKD involves progressive fluid accumulation see e.g. Grantham et al. 1 148 57 2006 Ye et al. 329 310 13 1993 . Fluid secretion into the cyst lumen requires chloride secretion by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR protein see e.g. Hanaoka et al. 11 1179 87 2000 Magenheimer et al. 17 3424 37 2006 a cAMP regulated chloride channel which when mutated causes the genetic disease cystic fibrosis see e.g. Riordan 77 701 26 2008 . CFTR is expressed strongly in epithelial cells lining cysts in ADPKD see e.g. Brill et al. 93 10206 11 1996 . Cystic fibrosis i.e. CFTR deficient mice are resistant to cyst formation and CFTR inhibitors block cyst formation in cell organ culture and in vivo models see e.g. Davidow et al. 50 208 18 1996 Li et al. 66 1926 38 2004 . In rare families affected with ADPKD and cystic fibrosis individuals with both ADPKD and CF have less severe renal disease than those with ADPKD only see e.g. Cotton et al. 32 1081 83 1998 O Sullivan et al. 32 976 83 1998 Xu et al. 19 529 34 2006 .

Several CFTR inhibitors have been discovered although many exhibit weak potency and lack CFTR specificity. The oral hypoglycemic agent glibenclamide inhibits CFTR Cl conductance from the intracellular side by an open channel blocking mechanism see e.g. Sheppard et al. 503 333 346 1997 Zhou et al. 120 647 62 2002 at high micromolar concentrations where it affects other Cl and cation channels see e.g. Edwards Weston 1993 Rabe et al. 110 1280 81 1995 Schultz et al. 79 S109 S144 1999 . Other non selective anion transport inhibitors including diphenylamine 2 carboxylate DPC 5 nitro 2 3 phenylpropyl amino benzoate NPPB and flufenamic acid also inhibit CFTR by occluding the pore at an intracellular site see e.g. Dawson et al. 79 S47 S75 1999 McCarty 203 1947 62 2000 .

High affinity CFTR inhibitors also have clinical application in the therapy of secretory diarrheas. Secretory diarrheas caused by enterotoxins such as cholera and Travelers diarrhea enteropathogenic require functional CFTR for primary chloride secretion into the intestinal lumen which secondarily drives sodium and water secretion see e.g. Kunzelmann et al. 82 245 89 2002 Thiagarajah et al. 3 594 9 2003 . Cell culture and animal models indicated that intestinal chloride secretion in enterotoxin mediated secretory diarrheas occurs mainly through CFTR see e.g. Clarke et al. 257 1125 28 1992 Gabriel et al. 266 107 109 1994 Kunzelmann and Mall 82 245 89 2002 Field 111 931 43 2003 and Thiagarajah et al. 126 511 519 2003 . Several classes of small molecule CFTR inhibitors have been described previously see e.g. review by Verkman et al. 8 153 71 2009 .

Diarrheal disease in children is a global health concern Approximately four billion cases among children occur annually resulting in at least two million deaths. Travelers diarrhea affects approximately 6 million people per year. Antibiotics are routinely used to treat diarrhea however the antibiotics are ineffective for treating many pathogens and the use of these drugs contributes to development of antibiotic resistance in other pathogens. Oral replacement of fluid loss is also routinely used to treat diarrhea but is primarily palliative. Therapy directed at reducing intestinal fluid secretion anti secretory therapy has the potential to overcome limitations of existing therapies.

A need exists for CFTR inhibitors particularly those that are safe non absorbable highly potent inexpensive and chemically stable.

Thus for example reference to a compound may refer to one or more compounds or a plurality of such compounds and reference to a cell or the cell includes reference to one or more cells and equivalents thereof e.g. plurality of cells known to those skilled in the art and so forth. Similarly reference to a composition includes a plurality of such compositions and refers to one or more compositions unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. When steps of a method are described or claimed and the steps are described as occurring in a particular order the description of a first step occurring or being performed prior to i.e. before a second step has the same meaning if rewritten to state that the second step occurs or is performed subsequent to the first step. The term about when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability or within statistical experimental error and thus the number or numerical range may vary between 1 and 15 of the stated number or numerical range. The term comprising and related terms such as comprise or comprises or having or including is not intended to exclude that in other certain embodiments for example an embodiment of any composition of matter composition method or process or the like described herein may consist of or consist essentially of the described features.

Provided herein are pyrimido pyrrolo oxazine dione BPO compounds that inhibit activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR chloride channel. Also provided herein are certain pyrimido pyrrolo quinoxalinedione PPQ compounds that inhibit CFTR. The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein are capable of inhibiting CFTR mediated ion transport e.g. CFTR mediated Cl transport i.e. inhibiting CFTR conductance . The most potent BPO compounds have substantially improved metabolic stability greater than 10 fold compared with a previously characterized PPQ compound called herein PPQ 102 see e.g. International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2011 019737 . These compounds disclosed herein also exhibit greater polarity and potency for inhibiting CFTR chloride conductance in vitro 10 fold and renal cystogenesis ex vivo 5 fold .

The compounds and compositions comprising these compounds are useful for administering to a subject who has or who is at risk of developing a disease disorder or condition that is treatable i.e. administration of the compounds and compositions will provide a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit by inhibiting CFTR mediated ion transport. The compounds described herein may therefore be useful for treating diseases disorders and conditions including for example polycystic kidney disease secretory diarrhea and other intestinal secretion conditions diseases and disorders characterized by aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion.

As noted above autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ADPKD is a major health care burden and has a prevalence of 1 in 500 to 1000 individuals see e.g. Torres et al. 2007 supra . No FDA approved drug is available at present that is capable of slowing the progression of renal disease in PKD. Cyst expansion in ADPKD also requires cyst epithelial cell proliferation involving mTor signaling see e.g. Lieberthal et al. 20 2493 502 2009 Torres et al. 5 1312 29 2010 which is the basis of several anti proliferative therapies under development see e.g. Belibi et al. 19 315 28 2010 Torres 3 1212 18 2008 Masoumi et al. 67 2495 2510 2007 Patel et al. 18 99 106 2009 Torres 17 190 204 2010 . Anti secretory e.g. CFTR inhibition therapy is predicted to complement antiproliferative therapy or be effective alone in life long treatment of ADPKD. The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein are CFTR inhibitors that may be useful as anti secretory therapy for PKD. An alternative anti secretory therapy vasopressin V2 antagonism is in clinical trials for PKD and is based on the concept that cysts in PKD often express V2 receptors which when stimulated by antidiuretic hormone elevate cytoplasmic cAMP and activate both CFTR chloride conductance and mTOR signaling see e.g. Belibi et al. 2010 supra Torres 3 1212 18 2008 . An alternative V2 receptor independent strategy has been suggested for reducing cAMP involving small molecule phosphodiesterase activators which were shown to resist growth in an in vitro PKD model see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. 75 134 42 2009 . Pure anti proliferative therapies most based on the central role of mTOR signaling in proliferation of cyst lining epithelial cells are also in clinical trials as well as renin angiotensin inhibitors and statins see e.g. Masoumi et al. 2007 supra Patel et al. 2009 supra Torres 2010 supra .

Several classes of small molecule CFTR inhibitors have been identified by high throughput screening and characterized see e.g. Verkman et al. supra . Exemplary compounds are shown in . Thiazolidinone class CFTR inhibitors such as CFTR 172 act on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane at a site near the CFTR pore to block CFTR chloride conductance see e.g. Caci et al. 413 135 42 2008 Ma et al. 110 1651 58 2002 Taddei et al. 558 52 56 2004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 235 573 and 7 638 543 . CFTR 172 inhibits CFTR with ICin the range of 300 3000 nM depending on cell type and membrane potential and has low toxicity and metabolic stability with primarily renal excretion see e.g. Ma et al. supra Sonawane et al. 94 134 43 2005 . The tetrazolo substituted thiazolidinone Tetrazolo 172 see had improved water solubility compared to CFTR 172 see e.g. Sonawane et al. 16 8187 95 2008 International Patent Application Publication No. WO 09 120 803 and reduced cyst expansion in organ culture and mouse models of PKD see e.g. Yang et al. 19 1300 10 2008 . A second class of small molecule CFTR inhibitors the glycine hydrazides such as GlyH 101 see block CFTR at an external site within the CFTR pore see e.g. Muanprasat et al. 124 125 37 2004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 414 037 and 7 888 332 . Membrane impermeant non absorbable conjugates of glycine hydrazides with polyethylene glycols see see e.g. Sonawane et al. 20 130 32 2006 Sonawane et al. 15 718 28 2008 U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 414 037 and 7 888 332 U.S. Application Publication No. US2009 0253799 Int l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 09 146 144 and lectins see e.g. Sonawane et al. 132 1234 44 2007 U.S. Application Publication No. 2008 0171793 Int l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 08 079 897 inhibit CFTR with an ICof 50 100 nM when added at the mucosal cell surface and were effective in rodent models of secretory diarrheas such as cholera. An absorbable glycine hydrazide phenyl GlyH 101 see reduced cyst growth in PKD see e.g. Yang et al. 2008 supra Int l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 09 120 803 .

Additional small molecule screening yielded pyrimido pyrrolo quinoxalinedione PPQ compounds which were uncharged and thus membrane potential insensitive CFTR inhibitors and were very potent CFTR inhibitors Tradtrantip et al. 52 6447 55 2009 Int l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 2011 019737 . One inhibitor called PPQ 102 7 9 dimethyl 11 phenyl 6 5 methyl furan 2 yl 5 6 dihydro pyrimido 4 5 3 4 pyrrolo 1 2 quinoxaline 8 10 7H 9H dione see inhibited CFTR chloride current with IC 90 nM by a mechanism involving stabilization of the channel closed state. PPQ 102 prevented cyst expansion and reduced the size of pre formed cysts in an embryonic kidney organ culture model of PKD. However PPQ 102 has poorer metabolic stability than desired precluding animal testing in certain animal models as well as low polarity and hence low aqueous solubility.

Derivative compounds of PPQ compounds were prepared. The BPO compounds described herein exhibit significantly improved stability water solubility and CFTR inhibition potency. The most potent compounds described herein have significantly improved potency more than 10 fold improved metabolic stability and much greater polarity and thus increased aqueous solubility compared to PPQ 102.

In another embodiment a method is provided for treating secretory diarrhea comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and at least one of the compounds of structure I or structure II substructures and specific structures described herein i.e. a pharmaceutical composition as described herein . In a particular embodiment the subject is a human or non human animal.

The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using the PPQ compounds and compositions comprising these compounds are described in greater detail herein.

Also provided herein are methods that are useful for example for characterizing the potency of BPO and PPQ compounds and derivatives and analogs thereof to inhibit CFTR mediated ion transport particularly CFTR mediated chloride ion transport for monitoring the level i.e. for example concentration level mass level or IClevel of a BPO or PPQ compound that has been administered to a subject and examining disease pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis by blocking or inhibiting CFTR function as models for cystic fibrosis disease such as in ex vivo tissues e.g. human tissues and in animals.

In certain embodiments these methods may be performed in vitro such as with using a biological sample as described herein that comprises for example cells obtained from a tissue body fluid or culture adapted cell line or other biological source as described in detail herein below. The step of contacting refers to combining mixing or in some manner familiar to persons skilled in the art that permits the compound and the cell to interact such that any effect of the compound on CFTR activity e.g. the capability of a BPO or PPQ compound to inhibit CFTR ion transport or the level to which the compound inhibits CFTR ion transport can be measured according to methods described herein and routinely practiced in the art. Methods described herein for inhibiting ion transport by CFTR are understood to be performed under conditions and for a time sufficient that permit the CFTR and the compound to interact. Additional BPO and PPQ compounds may be identified and or characterized by such a method of inhibiting ion transport by CFTR performed with isolated cells in vitro. Conditions for a particular assay include temperature buffers including salts cations media and other components that maintain the integrity of the cell and the compound which a person skilled in the art will be familiar and or which can be readily determined. A person skilled in the art also readily appreciates that appropriate controls can be designed and included when performing the in vitro methods and in vivo methods described herein.

In secretory epithelia fluid secretion occurs by primary chloride exit across the cell apical membrane which secondarily drives transepithelial sodium and water secretion see e.g. Barrett et al. 62 535 72 2000 . In renal cells lumenal fluid accumulation causes progressive cyst expansion directly by net water influx into the cyst lumen and indirectly by stretching cyst wall epithelial cells to promote their division and thinning Ye et al. 329 310 13 1993 Sullivan et al. 78 1165 91 1998 Tanner et al. 6 1230 41 1995 . Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory CFTR inhibition interferes with fluid secretion at the apical chloride exit step.

Methods for characterizing the compounds described herein for determining an effective concentration to achieve a therapeutic benefit for monitoring the level of a BPO or PPQ compound in a biological sample and for other purposes as described herein and apparent to a person skilled in the art may be performed using techniques and procedures described herein and routinely practiced by a person skilled in the art. Exemplary methods include but are not limited to fluorescence cell based assays of CFTR inhibition see e.g. Galietta et al. 281 C1734 C1742 2001 Ma et al. 110 1651 58 2002 short circuit apical chloride ion current measurements and patch clamp analysis see e.g. Muanprasat et al. 124 125 37 2004 Ma et al. 2002 supra Sonawane et al. 20 130 32 2006 see also e.g. Carmeliet 55 5 26 1993 Hamill et al. 391 85 100 1981 .

Methods that may be used to characterize a BPO or a PPQ compound including those described herein and to determine effectiveness of the compound for reducing inhibiting or preventing cyst enlargement and or preventing or inhibiting cyst formation and which compound is therefore useful for treating a subject who has or who is at risk of developing PKD include methods described in the art and herein. The PPQ compounds may be analyzed in models using embryonic or neonatal kidney organ cultures for example see e.g. Yang et al. 19 1300 1310 2008 Magenheimer et al. 17 3424 37 2006 Tradtrantip et al. 52 6447 55 2009 . Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory certain scientific observations support use of CFTR inhibitors to slow cyst growth in autosomal dominant PKD ADPKD a CFTR is expressed strongly in epithelial cells lining cysts in ADPKD b cystic fibrosis CFTR deficient mice are resistant to cyst formation c CFTR inhibitors block cyst formation in cell organ culture and in vivo models and d in some families affected with ADPKD and cystic fibrosis individuals with both ADPKD and CF have less severe renal disease than those with ADPKD only see e.g. O Sullivan et al. 32 976 983 1998 Cotton et al. 32 1081 1083 1998 Xu et al. 19 529 34 2006 . Intact kidney models to study cystogenesis are useful for recapitulating native kidney anatomy and cellular phenotype see e.g. Magenheimer et al. 17 3424 3437 2006 .

An additional example of a cell culture model for determining whether a compound inhibits cyst formation or enlargement includes an MDCK cell Madin Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cell model of PKD Li et al. 66 1926 38 2004 see also e.g. Neufeld et al. 41 1222 36 1992 Mangoo Karim et al. 86 6007 6011 1989 Mangoo Karim et al. 3 2629 32 1989 Grantham et al. 102 158 62 1989 Mohamed et al. 322 259 65 1997 . See also e.g. Murcia et al. 55 1187 97 1999 Igarishi et al. 13 2384 88 2002 . Accordingly provided herein are methods for identifying and or characterizing BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II and substructures and specific structures thereof by determining the capability of the compound to inhibit cyst enlargement or prevent or inhibit cyst formation in an in vitro cell culture model.

The MDCK cell line may also be used in methods and techniques for determining that a compound lacks cytotoxicity for example by evaluating cell viability e.g. by any one of numerous cell staining methods and microscopy methods routinely practiced in the art cell proliferation e.g. by determining the level of incorporation of nucleotide analogs and other methods for measuring division of cells and or apoptosis by using any one of a number of techniques and methods known in the art and described herein. Other methods for determining or quantifying the capability of a compound described herein to inhibit or reverse cyst enlargement or expansion and or to inhibit or prevent cyst formation and or to reduce the number of cysts formed include an embryonic kidney organ culture model which is practiced in the art and described herein see e.g. Magenheimer et al. 17 3424 37 2006 Steenhard et al. 16 1623 1631 2005 Yang et al. 19 1300 1310 2008 . In such an embryonic kidney culture model organotypic growth and differentiation of renal tissue can be monitored in defined media in the absence of any effect or influence by circulating hormones and glomerular filtration Magenheimer et al. supra Gupta et al. 63 365 376 2003 . In metanephric organ culture the early mouse kidney tubule has an intrinsic capacity to secrete fluid by a CFTR dependent mechanism in response to cAMP Magenheimer et al. supra .

Persons skilled in the art may also use animal models to characterize a BPO or PPQ compound including those described herein and to determine effectiveness of the compound for reducing inhibiting reversing or preventing cyst enlargement and or preventing or inhibiting cyst formation thereby reducing the number of cysts formed and to determine the usefulness of such compounds for treating a subject who has or who is at risk of developing MD. By way of example Pkd1mice and Ksp Cre transgenic mice in a C57BL 6 background may be generated as described and practiced in the art see e.g. Shibazaki et al. 13 10 11 2004 abstract Shao et al. 13 1837 46 2002 . Ksp Cre mice express Cre recombinase under the control of the Ksp cadherin promoter see e.g. Shao et al. supra . Pkd1 Ksp Cre mice may be generated by cross breeding Pkd1mice with Pkd1 Ksp Cre mice. The effect of a test compound may be determined by quantifying cyst size and growth in metanephroi and kidney sections histological analyses of tissues and cells and delay or prevention of renal failure and death see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. supra Shibazaki et al. supra .

The BPO and PPQ compounds may also be analyzed in animal models that are art accepted animal models for increased intestinal fluid secretion. By way of example a closed intestinal loop model of cholera suckling mouse model of cholera and in vivo imaging of gastrointestinal transit may be used for characterizing the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein see e.g. Takeda et al. 19 752 54 1978 see also e.g. Spira et al. 32 739 747 1981 . Animal models of secretory diarrheas have been useful for determining efficacy of thiazolidinone see e.g. Thiagarajah et al. 126 511 19 2004 and glycine hydrazide CFTR inhibitors see e.g. Sonawane et al. 15 718 28 2008 Sonawane et al. 132 1234 44 2007 and may be employed for testing the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein.

The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein may also be useful for establishing animal models that may be used as cystic fibrosis models. The CF phenotype in the absence of the CF genotype may be established by administering any one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein. CFTR inhibitors are also useful to create the CF phenotype in ex vivo human and animal tissues as has been done for example in studies of the role of CFTR in airway submucosal gland fluid secretion see e.g. Thiagarajah et al. 18 875 77 2004 . Finally though mouse pig and ferret models of CFTR gene deletion exist pharmacological creation of the CFTR phenotype in animals by CFTR inhibitors might provide complementary data on CFTR function in the absence of compensatory phenomena that can occur in transgenic animal models.

Methods of inhibiting CFTR mediated ion transport include in vitro methods that comprise contacting a cell with any one or more of the BPO and or PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II and substructures and specific structures thereof as described herein under conditions and for a time sufficient for CFTR present in the outer membrane of the cell and the compound to interact. Cells or cell lines that may be used in such methods are cells that express CFTR and have channels or pores formed by CFTR in the cell membrane. Exemplary cells and cell lines include without limitation a Fischer rat thyroid FRT cell including a FRT cell that co expresses human or other animal wildtype CFTR and the halide indicator YFP H148Q or other comparable yellow fluorescent protein a cultured human bronchial epithelial cell and a gastrointestinal cell such as T84 human intestinal epithelial cells that comprises CFTR in the outer membrane of the cell. Such methods are useful for identifying analogs of the BPO and PPQ compounds i.e. species of structure I or structure II including species of substructures described herein and for characterizing the BPO and PPQ compounds described herein.

In certain embodiments the cell is contacted in an in vitro assay and the cell may be obtained from a subject or from a biological sample. A biological sample may be a blood sample from which serum or plasma may be prepared and cells isolated biopsy specimen body fluids e.g. urine lung lavage ascites mucosal washings synovial fluid bone marrow lymph nodes tissue explant e.g. kidney cells organ culture e.g. kidney or any other tissue or cell preparation from a subject or a biological source. A sample may further refer to a tissue or cell preparation in which the morphological integrity or physical state has been disrupted for example by dissection dissociation solubilization fractionation homogenization biochemical or chemical extraction pulverization lyophilization sonication or any other means for processing a sample derived from a subject or biological source. The subject or biological source may be a human or non human animal a primary cell culture e.g. a primary kidney cell culture or primary intestinal epithelial cell culture or culture adapted cell line including but not limited to genetically engineered cell lines that may contain chromosomally integrated or episomal recombinant nucleic acid sequences immortalized or immortalizable cell lines somatic cell hybrid cell lines differentiated or differentiatable cell lines transformed cell lines and the like.

The BPO and PPQ compounds described herein may also be used in any one or more of the assays described above and herein for in vitro screening methods. By way of non limiting examples the compounds may be used as controls for comparing the potency polarity solubility or other properties of compounds in compound libraries when screening assays are performed to identify and characterize compounds that inhibit CFTR activity.

Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising any one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I or structure II and substructures and specific structures thereof . The compounds described herein may be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition for use in treatment or preventive or prophylactic treatment e.g. reducing the likelihood of occurrence of cyst formation of polycystic kidney disease PKD which includes autosomal dominant PKD ADPKD and autosomal recessive PKD ARPKD . In other embodiments a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one BPO or PPQ compound may be formulated for use in treatment or preventive treatment i.e. for reducing the likelihood of occurrence of a disease condition or disorder manifested by increased intestinal fluid secretion such as secretory diarrhea.

In pharmaceutical dosage forms any one or more of the BPO and PPQ compounds of structure I substructures and specific structures or structure II substructures and specific structures described herein may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative such as a salt or they may also be used alone or in appropriate association as well as in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The methods and excipients described herein are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.

Optimal doses may generally be determined using experimental models and or clinical trials. The optimal dose may depend upon the body mass weight or blood volume of the subject. In general the amount of a BPO or PPQ compound of structure I or structure II and substructures and specific structures thereof described herein that is present in a dose ranges from about 0.01 g to about 1000 g per kg weight of the host. The use of the minimum dose that is sufficient to provide effective therapy is usually preferred. Subjects may generally be monitored for therapeutic effectiveness using assays suitable for the condition being treated or prevented which assays will be familiar to those having ordinary skill in the art and are described herein. The level of a compound that is administered to a subject may be monitored by determining the level of the compound in a biological fluid for example in the blood blood fraction e.g. serum and or in the urine and or other biological sample from the subject. Any method practiced in the art to detect the compound may be used to measure the level of compound during the course of a therapeutic regimen.

The dose of a composition comprising at least one of the BPO or PPQ compounds described herein for treating PCKD may depend upon the subject s condition that is stage of the disease renal function severity of symptoms caused by enlarged cysts general health status as well as age gender and weight and other factors apparent to a person skilled in the medical art. Similarly the dose of the BPO or PPQ compound for treating a disease or disorder associated with aberrantly increased CFTR function including but not limited to intestinal fluid secretion secretory diarrhea such as a toxin induced diarrhea or secretory diarrhea associated with or a sequelae of an enteropathogenic infection Traveler s diarrhea ulcerative colitis irritable bowel syndrome IBS AIDS chemotherapy and other diseases or conditions described herein may be determined according to parameters understood by a person skilled in the medical art. Accordingly the appropriate dose may depend upon the subject s condition that is stage of the disease general health status as well as age gender and weight and other factors considered by a person skilled in the medical art.

Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a manner appropriate to the disease or disorder to be treated as determined by persons skilled in the medical arts. An appropriate dose and a suitable duration and frequency of administration will be determined by such factors as the condition of the patient the type and severity of the patient s disease the particular form of the active ingredient and the method of administration. In general an appropriate dose or effective dose and treatment regimen provides the composition s comprising at least one BPO or PPQ compound as described herein in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and or prophylactic benefit for example an improved clinical outcome such as more frequent complete or partial remissions or longer disease free and or overall survival or a lessening of symptom severity or other benefit as described in detail above . When a subject is treated for aberrantly increased intestinal fluid secretion clinical assessment of the level of dehydration and or electrolyte imbalance may be performed to determine the level of effectiveness of a compound and whether dose or other administration parameters such as frequency of administration or route of administration should be adjusted.

Polycystic kidney disease PKD or PCKD and polycystic renal disease are used interchangeably herein and refer to a group of disorders characterized by a large number of cysts distributed throughout enlarged kidneys. The resultant cyst development leads to impairment of kidney function and can eventually cause kidney failure. PKD includes autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ADPKD and recessive autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ARPKD in all stages of development regardless of the underlying etiology or cause. Effectiveness of a treatment for PKD may be monitored by one or more of several methods practiced in the medical art including for example by monitoring renal function by standard measurements and by radiologic investigations that are performed with ultrasounds computerized tomography CT or magnetic resonance imaging which are useful for evaluating renal cyst morphology and volume and estimating the amount of residual renal parenchyma.

To evaluate and to monitor the effectiveness of any one of the BPO or PPQ compounds described herein to treat PKD or a related disease or condition one or more of several clinical assay methods may be performed that are familiar to a person skilled in the clinical art. For example a clinical method called a urea clearance test may be performed. A blood sample is obtained from a subject to whom the compound is being administered so that the amount of urea in the bloodstream can be determined. In addition a first urine sample is collected from the subject and at least one hour later a second urine sample is collected. The amount of urea quantified in the urine indicates the amount of urea that is filtered or cleared by the kidneys into the urine. Another clinical assay method measures urine osmolality i.e. the amount of dissolved solute particles in the urine . Inability of the kidneys to concentrate the urine in response to restricted fluid intake or to dilute the urine in response to increased fluid intake during osmolality testing may indicate decreased kidney function.

Urea is a by product of protein metabolism and is formed in the liver. Urea is then filtered from the blood and excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The BUN blood urea nitrogen test measures the amount of nitrogen contained in the urea. High BUN levels may indicate kidney dysfunction but because blood urea nitrogen is also affected by protein intake and liver function the test is usually performed in conjunction with determination of blood creatinine which is considered a more specific indicator of kidney function. Low clearance values for creatinine and urea indicate diminished ability of the kidneys to filter these waste products from the blood and excrete them in the urine. As clearance levels decrease blood levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen increase. An abnormally elevated blood creatinine a more specific and sensitive indicator of kidney disease than the BUN is diagnostic of impaired kidney function.

The pharmaceutical compositions described herein that comprise at least one BPO or PPQ compound may be administered to a subject in need by any one of several routes that effectively deliver an effective amount of the compound. Such administrative routes include for example oral parenteral enteral rectal intranasal buccal sublingual intramuscular and transdermal. By way of example at least one or more of the compounds may be administered to a mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract e.g. by an enteral route which includes administration directly to the tract via a tube inserted into the nose stomach or small intestine or to a mucosal surface of the oral or nasal cavities or e.g. intranasal buccal sublingual and the like . These administrative methods and additional methods are discussed in greater detail herein.

A pharmaceutical composition may be a sterile aqueous or non aqueous solution suspension or emulsion which additionally comprises a physiologically acceptable excipient pharmaceutically acceptable or suitable excipient or carrier i.e. a non toxic material that does not interfere with the activity of the active ingredient .

Alternatively compositions described herein may be formulated as a lyophilizate or compounds may be encapsulated within liposomes using technology known in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other components which may be biologically active or inactive. Such components include but are not limited to buffers e.g. neutral buffered saline or phosphate buffered saline carbohydrates e.g. glucose mannose sucrose or dextrans mannitol proteins polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine antioxidants chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione stabilizers dyes flavoring agents and suspending agents and or preservatives.

Any suitable excipient or carrier known to those of ordinary skill in the art for use in pharmaceutical compositions may be employed in the compositions described herein.

A parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. The use of physiological saline is preferred and an injectable pharmaceutical composition is preferably sterile.

A composition comprising any one of the compounds of structure I or structure II substructures and specific structures described herein may be formulated for sustained or slow release. Such compositions may generally be prepared using well known technology and administered by for example oral rectal or subcutaneous implantation or by implantation at the desired target site. Sustained release formulations may contain the compound dispersed in a carrier matrix and or contained within a reservoir surrounded by a rate controlling membrane. Excipients for use within such formulations are biocompatible and may also be biodegradable preferably the formulation provides a relatively constant level of active component release. The amount of active compound contained within a sustained release formulation depends upon the site of implantation the rate and expected duration of release and the nature of the condition to be treated or prevented.

For oral formulations a BPO or PPQ compound of structure I and substructures and specific structures or of structure II and substructures and specific structures described herein can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets powders granules or capsules for example with conventional additives such as lactose mannitol corn starch or potato starch with binders such as starch gelatin natural sugars such as glucose or beta lactose corn sweeteners natural and synthetic gums such as acacia tragacanth or sodium alginate carboxymethylcellulose polyethylene glycol waxes crystalline cellulose cellulose derivatives and acacia with disintegrators such as corn starch potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose methyl cellulose agar bentonite or xanthan gum with lubricants such as talc sodium oleate magnesium stearate sodium stearate sodium benzoate sodium acetate or sodium chloride and if desired with diluents buffering agents moistening agents preservatives coloring agents and flavoring agents.

Synthesis Overview NMR spectra H at 600 MHz C at 150 MHz were obtained in methylene chloride CDCl chloroform CDCl acetonitrile CDCN or dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO d using a 600 MHz Varian Spectrometer. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million relative to the solvent. NMR spectra for PPQ and BPO compounds were acquired at 20 C. due to excessive broadening of the 11 phenyl protons at ambient temperature. NMR spectra for the intermediates were obtained at ambient temperature. Mass spectrometry was done using a Waters LC MS instrument with MS electrospray ionization mass ranging from 100 to 900 Da 20 V cone voltage LC Xterra MS Ccolumn 2.1 mm 50 mm 3.5 m 0.2 mL min water acetonitrile containing 0.1 TFA . Purity was judged by the peak area percentage of the UV absorbance signal. Compound purities by RP HPLC were 98 . Flash chromatography was done using EM silica gel 230 400 mesh and thin layer chromatography was done on EMD silica gel 60 F254 plates Darmstadt Germany . Melting points are uncorrected.

Efforts were undertaken to improve methods for synthesizing PPQ 102 because the original synthesis method developed had low yield see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. 52 6447 55 2009 Int l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 2011 019737 . As shown in Scheme 1 6 methyluracil 1 was exhaustively alkylated using dimethyl sulfate to give 1 3 6 trimethyluracil 2 in 98 yield. 1 3 6 Trimethyluracil 2 was subject to Friedel Crafts acylation utilizing benzoyl chloride and anhydrous zinc chloride to give ketone 3a in 66 yield. Bromination of ketone 3a gave 4a in quantitative yield. At the first point of diversification 4a was reacted with substituted 1 2 phenylenediamines 2 eq to give pyrroles 5a c in 97 R H 89 R NO and 83 R Me yields. Pyrroles 5a c were condensed with the appropriately substituted furfural or thiophene carbaldehyde using catalytic acid to give PPQ 5 15 23 with yields of 57 98 . PPQ 102 was obtained on a gram scale in 83 yield. Amide analogs were synthesized from PPQ 102 and acid halides or anhydrides to give PPQ 1 3 in 73 80 and 79 yields respectively. The nitrosamine PPQ 4 was synthesized from PPQ 102 and t butyl nitrite in 79 yield.

Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of benzoxazine BPO compounds. Ketone 3d R Me was synthesized from 2 by Friedel Crafts acylation utilizing m tolyl chloride in 26 yield and subsequently brominated to give 4d in 93 yield. The condensation of substituted 2 aminophenols with 4a d in ethanol gave pyrroles 5d h in 96 R CH R R H 96 R R R H 88 R H R Cl R NO 94 R R H R NO and 98 R R H R COOEt yields respectively. Pyrroles 5d h were then condensed with substituted furfurals using catalytic acid at 150 C. to give BPO 16 22 24 26 in yields of 43 84 . BPO 25 was saponified utilizing KOH in THF and water to give BPO 27 in 83 yield after acid work up.

In an experiment intended to improve yield bromination of ketone 3a was conducted under strict anhydrous conditions. Ketone 3a was refluxed in CHCland bromine 1 eq but after several hours TLC showed little product. Serendipitously when several drops of wet CHClwere added to the reaction a remarkably rapid discharge of the bromine color and evolution of fuming HBr gas occurred. After several minutes TLC indicated a near quantitative yield of 4a which spontaneously crystallized when dried in vacuo. When 4a was condensed with N methyl 1 2 phenylenediamine the more reactive secondary amine can undergo alkylation by displacement of the readily accessible bromide of 4a. The high regioselectivity evident in the 83 isolated yield of 5c suggests that the formation of the pyrrole ring in the initial reaction is one of imine formation rather than alkylation despite the crowded reaction center.

Modification of PPQ 102 by bromine substitution at the 5 position of the furan ring replacement of the secondary amine with an ether bridge and carboxylation gave BPO 27. Synthesis of BPO 27 is described below.

Pyrrole 5h 500 mg 1.19 mmol 5 bromofurfural 240 mg 1.37 mmol chloroform 7 mL TFA 10 L 14.8 mg 130 mol and 3 molecular sieves 2.0 g 8 12 mesh beads and a stir bar were sealed in an Emrys 10 20 mL process vial and submerged to the level of solvent in an oil bath at 150 C. The formation of the oxazine ring produces water that collects as beads at or near the top of the tube during the reaction. If the reaction were scaled up such that the beads became large enough to drip back into the reaction mixture the yield was diminished. The addition of molecular sieves reduced this problem for reactions containing less than 500 mg of the starting pyrrole. The reaction was stirred for 24 min then removed from the oil bath. Once the internal pressure had dropped the reaction vial was rapidly cooled in water. After cooling the reaction was filtered through celite into a 50 mL recovery flask and the dried in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in a minimum amount of CHCland quickly diluted with warm ethanol 25 mL . Fine crystals began to form immediately. The mixture was then placed on a rotary evaporator and the CHClwas removed to increase the quantity of crystals.

In a 500 mL round bottom flask equipped with stir bar BPO 25 1.00 g 1.73 mmol was dissolved in THF 100 mL with gentle heat and then allowed to cool. A mixture of water 70 mL and KOH 768 mg 13.7 mmol was quickly added to the vigorously stirred solution which formed a white suspension. After 3 days the mixture was a homogenous yellow solution free of BPO 25 as determined by LC MS. The THF was removed using a rotary evaporator and warm water bath leaving behind a viscous aqueous solution. The solution was made strongly acidic to litmus using 1 aq. HCl while stirring vigorously with a glass rod. The resulting gel was shaken with EtOAc 125 mL and then quickly poured into a 1 liter separatory funnel where a precipitate formed in the organic layer.

Crystal Preparation Fraction 1 BPO 27 isopropylamine carboxylate 30 mg 49 mmol was placed in a 75 ml separatory funnel filled with very dilute HCl aq 20 ml and EtOAc 20 ml . The mixture was shaken vigorously until no undissolved solids remained. The EtOAc layer was collected and extracted with brine and then dried over NaSO. The EtOAc was evaporated in a 50 ml recovery flask on a rotory evaporator and then dried under high vacuum to give a white solid 24 mg 44 mmol yield 89 . To the recovery flask was added a magnetic stir bar DMAP 1 mg 8 mmol EDAC 9 mg 47 mmol and finally dry DCM 15 ml . Once the stirred solution became homogenous dry ethanol 10 L 7.9 mg 172 mmol was added and the reaction was stirred for 24 h sealed with a rubber septum. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with dilute citric acid 10 ml . The organic layer was collected in a 50 ml beaker dried over NaSOand then evaporated in a 50 ml recovery flask on a rotary evaporator. The residue which shared the same Rvalue as racemic BPO 25 BPO 27 ethyl ester on TLC was purified by flash chromatography EtOAc hexanes 2 3 to give a clear residue 20 mg 35 mmol yield 79 .

The data collected were merged for least squares refinement to 4752 unique data R int 0.0925 . A series of least squares difference Fourier cycles were required to locate the remaining non hydrogen atoms and optimize the full occupancy disordered solvent toluene molecule. All non hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were idealized throughout the final refinement stages. The final structure was refined to convergence with R F 9.09 wR F2 22.64 GOF 1.128 for all 4752 unique reflections R F 8.86 wR F2 22.46 for those 4529 data with Fo 4 Fo . The final difference Fourier map was featureless indicating that the structure is both correct and complete. An empirical correction for extinction was also attempted and found to be negative and therefore not applied. The absolute structure parameters Flack x Flack 1983 A39 876 881 was refined and found to be 0.08 4 while the Hooft Hooft R. W. W Strayer L. H. Spek A.

Mouse Pharmacokinetics and Renal Accumulation A compound of structure I was formulated at 1 mg mL in 5 DMSO 2.5 Tween 80 and 2.5 PEG400 in HO based on formulations used for compounds of similar polarity and chemical properties. Male mice in a CD1 genetic background age 8 10 weeks 25 35 g were administered 300 L of the BPO 27 formulation by intraperitoneal injection. At specified times kidneys were removed following renal arterial perfusion with PBS. Kidneys were weighed mixed with acetic acid 100 l per 1 g tissue and ethyl acetate 10 mL per 1 g tissue and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3 000 rpm for 15 min. Calibration standards were prepared in kidney homogenates from control mice to which was added known amounts of BPO 27. The ethyl acetate containing supernatant was dried under nitrogen and the residue was reconstituted in acetonitrile HO 3 1 containing 0.1 formic acid. For analysis of blood and urine fluids were diluted with equal volume of water and extracted with ethyl acetate. LC MS analysis was carried out as described herein.

Embryonic Organ Culture Model of PKD Mouse embryos were obtained at embryonic day 13.5 E13.5 . Metanephroi were dissected and placed on transparent Falcon 0.4 mm diameter porous cell culture inserts as described see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. 2009 supra . To the culture inserts was added DMEM Ham s F 12 nutrient medium supplemented with 2 mM L glutamine 10 mM HEPES 5 g mL insulin 5 g mL transferrin 2.8 nM selenium 25 ng ml prostaglandin E 32 pg ml T3 250 U ml penicillin and 250 g ml streptomycin. Kidneys were maintained in a 37 C. humidified COincubator for up to 8 days. Culture medium containing 100 M 8 Br cAMP with or without test compound was replaced in the lower chamber every 12 h. Kidneys were photographed using a Nikon inverted microscope Nikon TE 2000 S equipped with 2 objective lens 520 nm bandpass filter and high resolution CCD camera. Percentage cyst area was calculated as total cyst area divided by total kidney area.

PPQ 102 is a small molecule inhibitor of CFTR chloride conductance with efficacy in preventing and reversing cyst formation in an organ culture model of PKD see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. 2009 supra Int l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 2011 019737 . Preliminary analysis of the metabolic stability and aqueous solubility of PPQ 102 indicated poorer metabolic stability and lower water solubility 2 M in albumin free saline than desired for optimal drugability. In vitro metabolic stability was determined by compound incubation with hepatic microsomes at 37 C. for specified times in the absence vs. presence of NADPH following by LC MS analysis. Shown in is PPQ 102 disappearance in hepatic microsomes in the presence of NADPH with 60 disappearance in 30 min.

No loss of PPQ 102 was seen in the absence of NADPH. PPQ 102 was undetectable in serum kidney and urine at 30 60 min after intravenous bolus administration of 300 g PPQ 102 in mice using an LC MS assay with sensitivity better than 100 nM. Though the precise metabolic fate of PPQ 102 is not known structural considerations and the presence of prominent metabolites at 14 and 16 daltons see suggested possible oxidation aromatization and hydroxylation see . To improve on the drug like properties of PPQ 102 a series of compound analogs were synthesized and tested.

Initial testing of the compounds for the capability to inhibit CFTR was performed using a plate reader assay in which iodide influx was measured in FRT cells co expressing human wild type CFTR and the iodide sensing yellow fluorescent protein YFP H148Q 1152L. top shows representative fluorescence data for inhibition of CFTR mediated iodide influx by one of the synthesized PPQ analogs which had a reduced negative slope after iodide addition with increasing inhibition concentration. bottom shows concentration inhibition data for selected compounds. Table B below provides ICvalues for PPQ and BPO compounds.

The relative ICvalues obtained from the plate reader assay are useful for comparisons. Absolute ICvalues obtained from the plate reader assay are approximate generally underestimating compound potency because of assay non linearities pH dependent YFP fluorescence the use of iodide instead of chloride and compound dilution at the start of the assay see e.g. Galietta et al. 281 C1734 42 2001 .

Quantitative concentration inhibition data for the most potent compounds were obtained by analysis of short circuit current which represents a definitive electrophysiological measure of compound potency. Current was measured in CFTR expressing FRT cells in which the basolateral membrane was permeabilized and in the presence of a transepithelial chloride concentration gradient so that current is a quantitative linear measure of CFTR function. CFTR was activated by forskolin followed by serial additions of increasing concentrations of test compounds. illustrates a representative short circuit current measurement. Increased CFTR chloride conductance was observed following addition the cAMP agonist forskolin. Conductance was reduced in a concentration dependent manner by a PPQ inhibitor with complete inhibition observed at high inhibitor concentration.

Initial synthesis efforts focused on preventing aromatization which was initially achieved by derivatizing the secondary amine of PPQ 102 to give analogs PPQ 1 5 . The PPQ 102 derived amides PPQ 1 3 were found to be substantially less active than PPQ 102. Because the loss of the basic amine coincided with a loss in activity nitrosamine PPQ 4 was synthesized but attempts to reduce the nitrosamine to a strongly basic hydrazine only yielded PPQ 102. To maintain basicity and to prevent aromatization synthesis of the N methyl analog PPQ 5 was attempted via reductive alkylation using formaldehyde but these efforts were unsuccessful. However the N methyl precursor 5c was obtained in good yield from N methyl 1 2 phenylenediamine and 4a. Pyrrole 5c was then used to synthesize PPQ 5 which was weakly active.

Re examination of SAR data obtained from 350 commercially available analogs see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. 2009 supra Int l Patent Appl. Publication No. WO 2011 019737 suggested that the 5 position of the furan ring in PPQ 102 was privileged. Therefore compounds PPQ 6 15 were synthesized to probe the steric and electronic requirements for activity of the furyl moiety. Substituting bromine at the 5 position of the furyl ring yielded PPQ 10 which was substantially more stable than PPQ 102 and had similar CFTR inhibition potency see C . To further probe oxidative aromatization as a metabolic pathway the secondary amine of PPQ 10 was replaced by oxygen forming an ether bridge which is unable to undergo oxidation. The resulting benzoxazine BPO 16 had similar CFTR inhibition potency see and better stability than PPQ 102. Synthesis of BPO 17 18 confirmed CFTR inhibition activity see Table B and improved stability see imparted by bromine and illustrated the synergy between the 5 bromofuran moiety and the ether bridge.

Previous SAR data see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. 2009 supra showed that an m tolyl moiety R Me increased CFTR inhibition potency. However synthesis of BPO 19 20 revealed that the m tolyl moiety reduced CFTR inhibition in the BPO series. To increase the polarity and hence the aqueous solubility of BPO 16 a nitro group was introduced at R. The resulting compound BPO 21 had substantially greater CFTR inhibition potency see with excellent metabolic stability in hepatic microsomes see . BPO 22 and PPQ 23 showed that the increased CFTR inhibition activity conferred by the nitro substituent at Rwas independent of both the 5 bromo substituent and the ether bridge.

To increase compound polarity further the nitro functionality at Rin BPO 21 was replaced with a carboxyl moiety to provide BPO 27. BPO 27 was the most potent CFTR inhibitor with IC 8 nM see and had excellent stability in hepatic microsomes with 

SAR analysis suggests that the relative stability of BPO 27 compared with PPQ 102 is the consequence of the 5 Br substituted furan and the ether bridge which largely prevent hydroxylation and aromatization modifications. The greatly improved water solubility of BPO 27 compared with PPQ 102 is a consequence of the carboxylic acid substituent which is charged at physiological pH. The carboxylic acid addition also unexpectedly improved CFTR inhibition potency.

An established embryonic ex vivo kidney organ culture model of PKD was used to test BPO 27 racemic mixture of R and S forms efficacy in reducing cAMP agonist induced renal cystogenesis see Example 30 . Progressive renal cyst formation and growth in 8 Br cAMP agonist treated cultures as seen by transmitted light microscopy is shown in . Kidney growth without cyst formation was observed in the absence of 8 Br cAMP. Cyst growth in the 8 Br cAMP treated kidney was remarkably reduced by inclusion of BPO 27 in the culture medium. As quantified by percentage area occupied by cysts BPO 27 inhibited cyst growth with ICof approximately 100 nM see much better than that of 500 nM measured for PPQ 102 see e.g. Tradtrantip et al. 2009 supra . Thus racemic BPO 27 was shown to have prevented and reversed renal cyst formation in an embryonic kidney culture model of PKD.

The racemic mixture of BPO 27 was further separated into its respective isolated enantiomers namely R BPO 27 and S BPO 27. See Example 2A. As shown herein while the R BPO 27 enantiomer strongly inhibited CFTR chloride conductance with IC 4 nM the other enantiomer S BPO 27 was inactive.

CFTR inhibition potency was measured by short circuit current analysis in FRT epithelial cells expressing human CFTR in presence of a transepithelial chloride gradient and in which the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with amphotericin B. Under these conditions short circuit current is proportional to CFTR chloride conductance. shows no significant inhibition by BPO 27 fraction 1 at 100 nM whereas BPO 27 fraction 2 at 100 nM completed inhibited current. shows the fraction 2 concentration dependence giving an ICof approximately 4 nM as compared to approximately 8 nM for racemic BPO 27 Example 31 .

The in vitro metabolic stability of R BPO 27 and S BPO 27 was studied using hepatic microsomes. Following compound incubation with hepatic microsomes in the presence of NADPH remaining non metabolized compound was assayed by LC MS. shows little metabolism of either BPO 27 isoform. As a control PPQ 102 was 75 metabolized at 4 h when tested in parallel.

BPO 27 pharmacokinetics in mice was measured following bolus intraperitoneal administration in an aqueous formulation in 5 DMSO 2.5 Tween 80 and 2.5 PEG400 in water. BPO 27 was measured by LC MS in kidney blood and urine. left shows ion current in calibration studies in which specified amounts of BPO 27 were added to kidney homogenates. The assay was linear with a detection sensitivity of better than 100 nM BPO 27. right shows the disappearance kinetics of BPO 27 from kidney following bolus intraperitoneal administration. summarizes the deduced BPO 27 concentrations in kidney blood and urine over time. The tfor disappearance of the original compound was approximately 2 h. Compound concentration remained at predicted therapeutic levels i.e. at levels much greater than 4 nM which is the IC for many hours following single dose administration.
