As more and more information is converted to digital form the demand for durable and reliable data storage services is ever increasing. In particular archive records backup files media files and the like may be maintained or otherwise managed by government entities businesses libraries individuals and the like. However the storage of digital information especially for long periods of time has presented some challenges. In some cases the cost of long term data storage may be prohibitive to many because of the potentially massive amounts of data to be stored particularly when considering archival or backup data. Additionally durability and reliability issues may be difficult to solve for such large amounts of data and or for data that is expected to be stored for relatively long periods of time. Magnetic tapes have traditionally been used in data backup systems because of the low cost. However tape based storage systems have been unable to fully exploit storage technology advances. Additionally drive based storage systems may consume too much power when left spinning constantly and or when not in use.

In the following description various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to among other things determining and or implementing one or more schedules for enabling operating providing power to or otherwise controlling one or more storage devices of a storage service. In some examples the storage service may be an archival data storage service that operates or otherwise utilizes many different computing devices and or storage devices. For example the archival storage service may include one or more disk drives that when operating utilize spinning magnetic media. Additionally the archival data storage service may include one or more racks located in one or more geographic locations e.g. potentially associated to different postal codes . Each rack may further include one or more or even hundreds of hard drives such as but not limited to disk drives or the like. Additionally rotating media of the hard drives operating drive controllers and or processors etc. generally consume relatively large amounts of power and can be costly.

In some aspects the archival data storage service may provide storage access and or placement of data and or one or more computing resources through a service such as but not limited to an archival data storage service a web service a remote program execution service or other network based data management service. For example a user client entity or other computing device may access via the archival data storage service data storage and or management. In some examples computing resource services such as those provided by the archival data storage service may include one or more computing resources accessible across one or more networks through user interfaces UIs application programming interfaces APIs and or other interfaces where the one or more computing resources may be scalable and or expandable as desired.

In some aspects an archival data storage service may be configured to minimize power and or cooling costs associated with storage devices by changing and or managing hard drive power consumption. By way of example only the archival data storage service may be configured to control the number of hard drives that may have actively spinning media at a given time. Additionally in some examples the archival data storage service may be configured to change the rotation speeds instead of shutting the drive on or off to save power. For example some drives could be slowed down and a rotation schedule could rotate which drives to slow down and which drives to run at normal speed. Additionally in some cases a data storage node which may be configured to control a data storage device such as a hard drive may determine and or control which hard drives are active and which hard drives are not. A hard drive may be considered active if it is spinning its media powering up and or powering down. For example a spinning hard drive may include one in which the disk is rotating and a head may magnetize locations of the drive to write read or delete data from the drive while rotating. However in other examples a drive may have been activated however it may not be fully rotating yet. In this example the drive may be powering up. Alternatively once a drive has been activated the data storage node or other controller may deactivate the drive however it may take some time before the drive is no longer spinning. This may be considered powering down. As such there may be times when the drive is operational but not active. Further in some examples activating a data storage device may include providing power to a device that is not currently receiving power or activating a device that is receiving power but is in a sleep mode. As such a data storage device may be in many states including but not limited off on sleep power down or power up.

In some aspects the data storage nodes may be configured to determine a rotation schedule provide the rotation schedule and or activate and deactivate storage devices. Additionally the storage nodes may report this information to a storage node registrar queue or other library so that one or more storage node managers may be informed regarding which write read or delete jobs to execute. It may be possible to execute write jobs at any time based at least in part on an assumption that there will generally be enough capacity to handle incoming write requests and place them into whichever drives are active. However in some examples the storage node managers may request or otherwise be instructed to execute write jobs in particular drives based at least in part on when they are active. In this case the storage node managers may first request the rotation schedule or at least an indication of which drives are active from the storage nodes prior to executing the jobs. It also may be possible to execute write jobs at any time based at least in part on an assumption that there will generally be enough active hard drives to process write requests at a desired rate even though some number of drives may not be active.

In at least one example rotation schedules may be based at least in part on a percentage or a number of drives to be active at the same time. For example the archival storage service may determine that only a predefined percentage of the drives should be active at any given time. As such all other drives may be in a sleep or other low power state mode while a predefined percentage may be active. Additionally the total number of drives may be broken into groups based at least in part on the determined percentage. For example and without limitation if the archival storage service determines that 20 of the drives should be active the set of drives to be controlled may be broken into five groups. In this way when each group of drives is active the predefined 20 of drives will be active. The other 80 of drives may be in a sleep or other low power mode. Alternatively any other percentage may be used to calculate a corresponding number of groups of drives e.g. 25 would make four groups 10 would make ten groups 50 would make two groups etc. as desired. Further in some aspects groups may not necessarily be equal in order to accommodate percentages that do not allow for equality among groups e.g. 11 would make nine equal groups and one smaller group . Alternatively percentages may be rounded up or down to accommodate equality among groups. Additionally in some examples an hour may be divided by the resulting number of groups to determine how long each group should be active. For example using the 20 example for illustrative purposes only each group may be scheduled to be active for 12 minutes to accommodate each group being active at least once per hour. Further in order to avoid power spikes or burnouts in some examples drives within a group may be powered up sequentially or at least not all at the same time. Alternatively or in addition each drive of a group that is active may be sequentially powered down while drives of the next group to be activated are sequentially powered up.

In other examples rotation schedules may be based at least in part on a predefined number of drives to be active at a given time as opposed to a percentage. Additionally the rotation schedule may include a sliding window that moves at a speed or interval along a theoretical or real array of drives. Drives that are located within the window may be activated while drives outside the window may be in a low power state which may include being off or deactivated . As desired the drives may be sorted on a time line based at least in part on their actual location and or based at least in part on some logical mapping. The window may be configured to traverse the timeline. Alternatively other examples of activating drives within a sliding window may be envisioned. The rotation schedules may also be based at least in part on demand including but not limited to peak power consumption times e.g. based at least in part on utility company fees and or estimates customer demand pending jobs etc. By way of example only one scenario may include scheduling drives to be actively based at least in part on pending read requests from multiple storage node managers. In this example the storage node registrar may be configured to select a number or percentage of drives that should come into a rotation in order to meet the demand. The storage node registrar may also send a message to the storage nodes once the drives are selected to come into the rotation that the drives have been scheduled for rotation. Alternatively or in addition the storage node managers may notify the storage nodes once the registrar has included the appropriate drives in the rotation.

In one non limiting example the controller may follow the schedule to activate HDD Group 4 based at least in part on instruction labeled ON. That is instruction may correspond to HDD Group 4 and may indicate that HDD Group 4 should be active for a predetermined amount of time. As noted above the amount of time each group may be active may be based at least in part on several factors including but not limited to a portion of an hour based at least in part on a division of groups and or some on demand requests of the storage node. After the predefined time period has expired the controller may move the ON instruction down the chain of instructions such that HDD Group 5 may be active next. As such instruction is labeled Power Up to indicate that HDD Group 5 may be scheduled to begin powering up at some point in the future. Similarly instruction is labeled Power Down to indicate that HDD Group 3 may still be powering down after being active. In at least one example after a predefined time e.g. based at least in part on the schedule the controller may shift the instructions down one such that instruction may be labeled ON and HDD Group 5 may become activated. Other scenarios and or examples may be possible for scheduling rotation of the drives. For example each HDD group may include only a single storage drive such that each HDD Group may include one or more drives and is not limited to a scenario where each group includes multiple drives. Additionally as noted above additional instructions may be processed in order to avoid power consumption spikes based at least in part on activating multiple drives at the same time. For example the drives of a group that are scheduled to rotate during a certain period may be scheduled to activate one at a time or in sub groups as desired. Additionally the HDD Groups and or individual hard drives may not be listed and or may not be in any particular order as shown. For example the controller may instead keep track in a table chart index etc. which drives or Groups have been activated during a particular period and randomly or on demand cycle through activation of drives that have yet to be activated during the period. Thus the controller may be free to determine which drives should be activated and when without being limited by the grouping or list shown in .

In an embodiment archival data storage system provides a multi tenant or multi customer environment where each tenant or customer may store retrieve delete or otherwise manage data in a data storage space allocated to the customer. In some embodiments an archival data storage system comprises multiple subsystems or planes that each provides a particular set of services or functionalities. For example as illustrated in archival data storage system includes front end control plane for direct I O common control plane data plane and metadata plane . Each subsystem or plane may comprise one or more components that collectively provide the particular set of functionalities. Each component may be implemented by one or more physical and or logical computing devices such as computers data storage devices and the like. Components within each subsystem may communicate with components within the same subsystem components in other subsystems or external entities such as customers. At least some of such interactions are indicated by arrows in . In particular the main bulk data transfer paths in and out of archival data storage system are denoted by bold arrows. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that various embodiments may have fewer or a greater number of systems subsystems and or subcomponents than are illustrated in . Thus the depiction of environment in should be taken as being illustrative in nature and not limiting to the scope of the disclosure.

In the illustrative embodiment front end implements a group of services that provides an interface between the archival data storage system and external entities such as one or more customers described herein. In various embodiments front end provides an application programming interface API to enable a user to programmatically interface with the various features components and capabilities of the archival data storage system. Such APIs may be part of a user interface that may include graphical user interfaces GUIs Web based interfaces programmatic interfaces such as application programming interfaces APIs and or sets of remote procedure calls RPCs corresponding to interface elements messaging interfaces in which the interface elements correspond to messages of a communication protocol and or suitable combinations thereof.

Capabilities provided by archival data storage system may include data storage data retrieval data deletion metadata operations configuration of various operational parameters and the like. Metadata operations may include requests to retrieve catalogs of data stored for a particular customer data recovery requests job inquires and the like. Configuration APIs may allow customers to configure account information audit logs policies notifications settings and the like. A customer may request the performance of any of the above operations by sending API requests to the archival data storage system. Similarly the archival data storage system may provide responses to customer requests. Such requests and responses may be submitted over any suitable communications protocol such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP File Transfer Protocol FTP and the like in any suitable format such as REpresentational State Transfer REST Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP and the like. The requests and responses may be encoded for example using Base64 encoding encrypted with a cryptographic key or the like.

In some embodiments archival data storage system allows customers to create one or more logical structures such as a logical data containers in which to store one or more archival data objects. As used herein data object is used broadly and does not necessarily imply any particular structure or relationship to other data. A data object may be for instance simply a sequence of bits. Typically such logical data structures may be created to meeting certain business requirements of the customers and are independently of the physical organization of data stored in the archival data storage system. As used herein the term logical data container refers to a grouping of data objects. For example data objects created for a specific purpose or during a specific period of time may be stored in the same logical data container. Each logical data container may include nested data containers or data objects and may be associated with a set of policies such as size limit of the container maximum number of data objects that may be stored in the container expiration date access control list and the like. In various embodiments logical data containers may be created deleted or otherwise modified by customers via API requests by a system administrator or by the data storage system for example based on configurable information. For example the following HTTP PUT request may be used in an embodiment to create a logical data container with name logical container name associated with a customer identified by an account identifier accountId .

In an embodiment archival data storage system provides the APIs for customers to store data objects into logical data containers. For example the following HTTP POST request may be used in an illustrative embodiment to store a data object into a given logical container. In an embodiment the request may specify the logical path of the storage location data length reference to the data payload a digital digest of the data payload and other information. In one embodiment the APIs may allow a customer to upload multiple data objects to one or more logical data containers in one request. In another embodiment where the data object is large the APIs may allow a customer to upload the data object in multiple parts each with a portion of the data object.

In response to a data storage request in an embodiment archival data storage system provides a data object identifier if the data object is stored successfully. Such data object identifier may be used to retrieve delete or otherwise refer to the stored data object in subsequent requests. In some embodiments such as data object identifier may be self describing in that it includes for example with or without encryption storage location information that may be used by the archival data storage system to locate the data object without the need for an additional data structures such as a global namespace key map. In addition in some embodiments data object identifiers may also encode other information such as payload digest error detection code access control data and the other information that may be used to validate subsequent requests and data integrity. In some embodiments the archival data storage system stores incoming data in a transient durable data store before moving it archival data storage. Thus although customers may perceive that data is persisted durably at the moment when an upload request is completed actual storage to a long term persisted data store may not commence until sometime later e.g. 12 hours later . In some embodiments the timing of the actual storage may depend on the size of the data object the system load during a diurnal cycle configurable information such as a service level agreement between a customer and a storage service provider and other factors.

In some embodiments archival data storage system provides the APIs for customers to retrieve data stored in the archival data storage system. In such embodiments a customer may initiate a job to perform the data retrieval and may learn the completion of the job by a notification or by polling the system for the status of the job. As used herein a job refers to a data related activity corresponding to a customer request that may be performed temporally independently from the time the request is received. For example a job may include retrieving storing and deleting data retrieving metadata and the like. A job may be identified by a job identifier that may be unique for example among all the jobs for a particular customer. For example the following HTTP POST request may be used in an illustrative embodiment to initiate a job to retrieve a data object identified by a data object identifier dataObjectId. In other embodiments a data retrieval request may request the retrieval of multiple data objects data objects associated with a logical data container and the like.

In response to the request in an embodiment archival data storage system provides a job identifier job id that is assigned to the job in the following response. The response provides in this example a path to the storage location where the retrieved data will be stored.

At any given point in time the archival data storage system may have many jobs pending for various data operations. In some embodiments the archival data storage system may employ job planning and optimization techniques such as batch processing load balancing job coalescence and the like to optimize system metrics such as cost performance scalability and the like. In some embodiments the timing of the actual data retrieval depends on factors such as the size of the retrieved data the system load and capacity active status of storage devices and the like. For example in some embodiments at least some data storage devices in an archival data storage system may be activated or inactivated according to a power management schedule for example to reduce operational costs. Thus retrieval of data stored in a currently active storage device such as a rotating hard drive may be faster than retrieval of data stored in a currently inactive storage device such as a spinned down hard drive .

In an embodiment when a data retrieval job is completed the retrieved data is stored in a staging data store and made available for customer download. In some embodiments a customer is notified of the change in status of a job by a configurable notification service. In other embodiments a customer may learn of the status of a job by polling the system using a job identifier. The following HTTP GET request may be used in an embodiment to download data that is retrieved by a job identified by job id using a download path that has been previously provided.

In response to the GET request in an illustrative embodiment archival data storage system may provide the retrieved data in the following HTTP response with a tree hash of the data for verification purposes.

In an embodiment a customer may request the deletion of a data object stored in an archival data storage system by specifying a data object identifier associated with the data object. For example in an illustrative embodiment a data object with data object identifier dataObjectId may be deleted using the following HTTP request. In another embodiment a customer may request the deletion of multiple data objects such as those associated with a particular logical data container.

In various embodiments data objects may be deleted in response to a customer request or may be deleted automatically according to a user specified or default expiration date. In some embodiments data objects may be rendered inaccessible to customers upon an expiration time but remain recoverable during a grace period beyond the expiration time. In various embodiments the grace period may be based on configurable information such as customer configuration service level agreement terms and the like. In some embodiments a customer may be provided the abilities to query or receive notifications for pending data deletions and or cancel one or more of the pending data deletions. For example in one embodiment a customer may set up notification configurations associated with a logical data container such that the customer will receive notifications of certain events pertinent to the logical data container. Such events may include the completion of a data retrieval job request the completion of metadata request deletion of data objects or logical data containers and the like.

In an embodiment archival data storage system also provides metadata APIs for retrieving and managing metadata such as metadata associated with logical data containers. In various embodiments such requests may be handled asynchronously where results are returned later or synchronously where results are returned immediately .

Still referring to in an embodiment at least some of the API requests discussed above are handled by API request handler as part of front end . For example API request handler may decode and or parse an incoming API request to extract information such as uniform resource identifier URI requested action and associated parameters identity information data object identifiers and the like. In addition API request handler invoke other services described below where necessary to further process the API request.

In an embodiment front end includes an authentication service that may be invoked for example by API handler to authenticate an API request. For example in some embodiments authentication service may verify identity information submitted with the API request such as username and password Internet Protocol IP address cookies digital certificate digital signature and the like. In other embodiments authentication service may require the customer to provide additional information or perform additional steps to authenticate the request such as required in a multifactor authentication scheme under a challenge response authentication protocol and the like.

In an embodiment front end includes an authorization service that may be invoked for example by API handler to determine whether a requested access is permitted according to one or more policies determined to be relevant to the request. For example in one embodiment authorization service verifies that a requested access is directed to data objects contained in the requestor s own logical data containers or which the requester is otherwise authorized to access. In some embodiments authorization service or other services of front end may check the validity and integrity of a data request based at least in part on information encoded in the request such as validation information encoded by a data object identifier.

In an embodiment front end includes a metering service that monitors service usage information for each customer such as data storage space used number of data objects stored data requests processed and the like. In an embodiment front end also includes accounting service that performs accounting and billing related functionalities based for example on the metering information collected by the metering service customer account information and the like. For example a customer may be charged a fee based on the storage space used by the customer size and number of the data objects types and number of requests submitted customer account type service level agreement the like.

In an embodiment front end batch processes some or all incoming requests. For example front end may wait until a certain number of requests has been received before processing e.g. authentication authorization accounting and the like the requests. Such a batch processing of incoming requests may be used to gain efficiency.

In some embodiments front end may invoke services provided by other subsystems of the archival data storage system to further process an API request. For example front end may invoke services in metadata plane to fulfill metadata requests. For another example front end may stream data in and out of control plane for direct I O for data storage and retrieval requests respectively.

Referring now to control plane for direct I O illustrated in in various embodiments control plane for direct I O provides services that create track and manage jobs created as a result of customer requests. As discussed above a job refers to a customer initiated activity that may be performed asynchronously to the initiating request such as data retrieval storage metadata queries or the like. In an embodiment control plane for direct I O includes a job tracker that is configured to create job records or entries corresponding to customer requests such as those received from API request handler and monitor the execution of the jobs. In various embodiments a job record may include information related to the execution of a job such as a customer account identifier job identifier data object identifier reference to payload data cache described below job status data validation information and the like. In some embodiments job tracker may collect information necessary to construct a job record from multiple requests. For example when a large amount of data is requested to be stored data upload may be broken into multiple requests each uploading a portion of the data. In such a case job tracker may maintain information to keep track of the upload status to ensure that all data parts have been received before a job record is created. In some embodiments job tracker also obtains a data object identifier associated with the data to be stored and provides the data object identifier for example to a front end service to be returned to a customer. In an embodiment such data object identifier may be obtained from data plane services such as storage node manager storage node registrar and the like described below.

In some embodiments control plane for direct I O includes a job tracker store for storing job entries or records. In various embodiments job tracker store may be implemented by a NoSQL data management system such as a key value data store a relational database management system RDBMS or any other data storage system. In some embodiments data stored in job tracker store may be partitioned to enable fast enumeration of jobs that belong to a specific customer facilitate efficient bulk record deletion parallel processing by separate instances of a service and the like. For example job tracker store may implement tables that are partitioned according to customer account identifiers and that use job identifiers as range keys. In an embodiment job tracker store is further sub partitioned based on time such as job expiration time to facilitate job expiration and cleanup operations. In an embodiment transactions against job tracker store may be aggregated to reduce the total number of transactions. For example in some embodiments a job tracker may perform aggregate multiple jobs corresponding to multiple requests into one single aggregated job before inserting it into job tracker store .

In an embodiment job tracker is configured to submit the job for further job scheduling and planning for example by services in common control plane . Additionally job tracker may be configured to monitor the execution of jobs and update corresponding job records in job tracker store as jobs are completed. In some embodiments job tracker may be further configured to handle customer queries such as job status queries. In some embodiments job tracker also provides notifications of job status changes to customers or other services of the archival data storage system. For example when a data retrieval job is completed job tracker may cause a customer to be notified for example using a notification service that data is available for download. As another example when a data storage job is completed job tracker may notify a cleanup agent to remove payload data associated with the data storage job from a transient payload data cache described below.

In an embodiment control plane for direct I O includes a payload data cache for providing transient data storage services for payload data transiting between data plane and front end . Such data includes incoming data pending storage and outgoing data pending customer download. As used herein transient data store is used interchangeably with temporary or staging data store to refer to a data store that is used to store data objects before they are stored in an archival data storage described herein or to store data objects that are retrieved from the archival data storage. A transient data store may provide volatile or non volatile durable storage. In most embodiments while potentially usable for persistently storing data a transient data store is intended to store data for a shorter period of time than an archival data storage system and may be less cost effective than the data archival storage system described herein. In one embodiment transient data storage services provided for incoming and outgoing data may be differentiated. For example data storage for the incoming data which is not yet persisted in archival data storage may provide higher reliability and durability than data storage for outgoing retrieved data which is already persisted in archival data storage. In another embodiment transient storage may be optional for incoming data that is incoming data may be stored directly in archival data storage without being stored in transient data storage such as payload data cache for example when there is the system has sufficient bandwidth and or capacity to do so.

In an embodiment control plane for direct I O also includes a cleanup agent that monitors job tracker store and or payload data cache and removes data that is no longer needed. For example payload data associated with a data storage request may be safely removed from payload data cache after the data is persisted in permanent storage e.g. data plane . On the reverse path data staged for customer download may be removed from payload data cache after a configurable period of time e.g. 30 days since the data is staged or after a customer indicates that the staged data is no longer needed.

In some embodiments cleanup agent removes a job record from job tracker store when the job status indicates that the job is complete or aborted. As discussed above in some embodiments job tracker store may be partitioned to enable to enable faster cleanup. In one embodiment where data is partitioned by customer account identifiers cleanup agent may remove an entire table that stores jobs for a particular customer account when the jobs are completed instead of deleting individual jobs one at a time. In another embodiment where data is further sub partitioned based on job expiration time cleanup agent may bulk delete a whole partition or table of jobs after all the jobs in the partition expire. In other embodiments cleanup agent may receive instructions or control messages such as indication that jobs are completed from other services such as job tracker that cause the cleanup agent to remove job records from job tracker store and or payload data cache .

Referring now to common control plane illustrated in . In various embodiments common control plane provides a queue based load leveling service to dampen peak to average load levels jobs coming from control plane for I O and to deliver manageable workload to data plane . In an embodiment common control plane includes a job request queue for receiving jobs created by job tracker in control plane for direct I O described above a storage node manager job store from which services from data plane e.g. storage node managers pick up work to execute and a request balancer for transferring job items from job request queue to storage node manager job store in an intelligent manner.

In an embodiment job request queue provides a service for inserting items into and removing items from a queue e.g. first in first out FIFO or first in last out FILO a set or any other suitable data structure. Job entries in the job request queue may be similar to or different from job records stored in job tracker store described above.

In an embodiment common control plane also provides a durable high efficiency job store storage node manager job store that allows services from data plane e.g. storage node manager anti entropy watcher to perform job planning optimization check pointing and recovery. For example in an embodiment storage node manager job store allows the job optimization such as batch processing operation coalescing and the like by supporting scanning querying sorting or otherwise manipulating and managing job items stored in storage node manager job store . In an embodiment a storage node manager scans incoming jobs and sort the jobs by the type of data operation e.g. read write or delete storage locations e.g. volume disk customer account identifier and the like. The storage node manager may then reorder coalesce group in batches or otherwise manipulate and schedule the jobs for processing. For example in one embodiment the storage node manager may batch process all the write operations before all the read and delete operations. In another embodiment the storage node manager may perform operation coalescing. For another example the storage node manager may coalesce multiple retrieval jobs for the same object into one job or cancel a storage job and a deletion job for the same data object where the deletion job comes after the storage job.

In an embodiment storage node manager job store is partitioned for example based on job identifiers so as to allow independent processing of multiple storage node managers and to provide even distribution of the incoming workload to all participating storage node managers . In various embodiments storage node manager job store may be implemented by a NoSQL data management system such as a key value data store a RDBMS or any other data storage system.

In an embodiment request balancer provides a service for transferring job items from job request queue to storage node manager job store so as to smooth out variation in workload and to increase system availability. For example request balancer may transfer job items from job request queue at a lower rate or at a smaller granularity when there is a surge in job requests coming into the job request queue and vice versa when there is a lull in incoming job requests so as to maintain a relatively sustainable level of workload in the storage node manager store . In some embodiments such sustainable level of workload is around the same or below the average workload of the system.

In an embodiment job items that are completed are removed from storage node manager job store and added to the job result queue . In an embodiment data plane services e.g. storage node manager are responsible for removing the job items from the storage node manager job store and adding them to job result queue . In some embodiments job request queue is implemented in a similar manner as job request queue discussed above.

Referring now to data plane illustrated in . In various embodiments data plane provides services related to long term archival data storage retrieval and deletion data management and placement anti entropy operations and the like. In various embodiments data plane may include any number and type of storage entities such as data storage devices such as tape drives hard disk drives solid state devices and the like storage nodes or servers datacenters and the like. Such storage entities may be physical virtual or any abstraction thereof e.g. instances of distributed storage and or computing systems and may be organized into any topology including hierarchical or tiered topologies. Similarly the components of the data plane may be dispersed local or any combination thereof. For example various computing or storage components may be local or remote to any number of datacenters servers or data storage devices which in turn may be local or remote relative to one another. In various embodiments physical storage entities may be designed for minimizing power and cooling costs by controlling the portions of physical hardware that are active e.g. the number of hard drives that are actively rotating . In an embodiment physical storage entities implement techniques such as Shingled Magnetic Recording SMR to increase storage capacity.

In an environment illustrated by one or more storage node managers each controls one or more storage nodes by sending and receiving data and control messages. Each storage node in turn controls a potentially large collection of data storage devices such as hard disk drives. In various embodiments a storage node manager may communicate with one or more storage nodes and a storage node may communicate with one or more storage node managers . In an embodiment storage node managers are implemented by one or more computing devices that are capable of performing relatively complex computations such as digest computation data encoding and decoding job planning and optimization and the like. In some embodiments storage nodes are implemented by one or more computing devices with less powerful computation capabilities than storage node managers . Further in some embodiments the storage node manager may not be included in the data path. For example data may be transmitted from the payload data cache directly to the storage nodes or from one or more storage nodes to the payload data cache . In this way the storage node manager may transmit instructions to the payload data cache and or the storage nodes without receiving the payloads directly from the payload data cache and or storage nodes . In various embodiments a storage node manager may send instructions or control messages to any other components of the archival data storage system described herein to direct the flow of data.

In an embodiment a storage node manager serves as an entry point for jobs coming into and out of data plane by picking job items from common control plane e.g. storage node manager job store retrieving staged data from payload data cache and performing necessary data encoding for data storage jobs and requesting appropriate storage nodes to store retrieve or delete data. Once the storage nodes finish performing the requested data operations the storage node manager may perform additional processing such as data decoding and storing retrieved data in payload data cache for data retrieval jobs and update job records in common control plane e.g. removing finished jobs from storage node manager job store and adding them to job result queue .

In an embodiment storage node manager performs data encoding according to one or more data encoding schemes before data storage to provide data redundancy security and the like. Such data encoding schemes may include encryption schemes redundancy encoding schemes such as erasure encoding redundant array of independent disks RAID encoding schemes replication and the like. Likewise in an embodiment storage node managers performs corresponding data decoding schemes such as decryption erasure decoding and the like after data retrieval to restore the original data.

As discussed above in connection with storage node manager job store storage node managers may implement job planning and optimizations such as batch processing operation coalescing and the like to increase efficiency. In some embodiments jobs are partitioned among storage node managers so that there is little or no overlap between the partitions. Such embodiments facilitate parallel processing by multiple storage node managers for example by reducing the probability of racing or locking.

In various embodiments data plane is implemented to facilitate data integrity. For example storage entities handling bulk data flows such as storage nodes managers and or storage nodes may validate the digest of data stored or retrieved check the error detection code to ensure integrity of metadata and the like.

In various embodiments data plane is implemented to facilitate scalability and reliability of the archival data storage system. For example in one embodiment storage node managers maintain no or little internal state so that they can be added removed or replaced with little adverse impact. In one embodiment each storage device is a self contained and self describing storage unit capable of providing information about data stored thereon. Such information may be used to facilitate data recovery in case of data loss. Furthermore in one embodiment each storage node is capable of collecting and reporting information about the storage node including the network location of the storage node and storage information of connected storage devices to one or more storage node registrars and or storage node registrar stores . In some embodiments storage nodes perform such self reporting at system start up time and periodically provide updated information. In various embodiments such a self reporting approach provides dynamic and up to date directory information without the need to maintain a global namespace key map or index which can grow substantially as large amounts of data objects are stored in the archival data system.

In an embodiment data plane may also include one or more storage node registrars that provide directory information for storage entities and data stored thereon data placement services and the like. Storage node registrars may communicate with and act as a front end service to one or more storage node registrar stores which provide storage for the storage node registrars . In various embodiments storage node registrar store may be implemented by a NoSQL data management system such as a key value data store a RDBMS or any other data storage system. In some embodiments storage node registrar stores may be partitioned to enable parallel processing by multiple instances of services. As discussed above in an embodiment information stored at storage node registrar store is based at least partially on information reported by storage nodes themselves.

In some embodiments storage node registrars provide directory service for example to storage node managers that want to determine which storage nodes to contact for data storage retrieval and deletion operations. For example given a volume identifier provided by a storage node manager storage node registrars may provide based on a mapping maintained in a storage node registrar store a list of storage nodes that host volume components corresponding to the volume identifier. Specifically in one embodiment storage node registrar store stores a mapping between a list of identifiers of volumes or volume components and endpoints such as Domain Name System DNS names of storage nodes that host the volumes or volume components.

As used herein a volume refers to a logical storage space within a data storage system in which data objects may be stored. A volume may be identified by a volume identifier. A volume may reside in one physical storage device e.g. a hard disk or span across multiple storage devices. In the latter case a volume comprises a plurality of volume components each residing on a different storage device. As used herein a volume component refers a portion of a volume that is physically stored in a storage entity such as a storage device. Volume components for the same volume may be stored on different storage entities. In one embodiment when data is encoded by a redundancy encoding scheme e.g. erasure coding scheme RAID replication each encoded data component or shard may be stored in a different volume component to provide fault tolerance and isolation. In some embodiments a volume component is identified by a volume component identifier that includes a volume identifier and a shard slot identifier. As used herein a shard slot identifies a particular shard row or stripe of data in a redundancy encoding scheme. For example in one embodiment a shard slot corresponds to an erasure coding matrix row. In some embodiments storage node registrar store also stores information about volumes or volume components such as total used and free space number of data objects stored and the like.

In some embodiments data plane also includes a storage allocator for allocating storage space e.g. volumes on storage nodes to store new data objects based at least in part on information maintained by storage node registrar store to satisfy data isolation and fault tolerance constraints. In some embodiments storage allocator requires manual intervention.

In some embodiments data plane also includes an anti entropy watcher for detecting entropic effects and initiating anti entropy correction routines. For example anti entropy watcher may be responsible for monitoring activities and status of all storage entities such as storage nodes reconciling live or actual data with maintained data and the like. In various embodiments entropic effects include but are not limited to performance degradation due to data fragmentation resulting from repeated write and rewrite cycles hardware wear e.g. of magnetic media data unavailability and or data loss due to hardware software malfunction environmental factors physical destruction of hardware random chance or other causes. Anti entropy watcher may detect such effects and in some embodiments may preemptively and or reactively institute anti entropy correction routines and or policies.

In an embodiment anti entropy watcher causes storage nodes to perform periodic anti entropy scans on storage devices connected to the storage nodes. Anti entropy watcher may also inject requests in job request queue and subsequently job result queue to collect information recover data and the like. In some embodiments anti entropy watcher may perform scans for example on cold index store described below and storage nodes to ensure referential integrity.

In an embodiment information stored at storage node registrar store is used by a variety of services such as storage node registrar storage allocator anti entropy watcher and the like. For example storage node registrar may provide data location and placement services e.g. to storage node managers during data storage retrieval and deletion. For example given the size of a data object to be stored and information maintained by storage node registrar store a storage node registrar may determine where e.g. volume to store the data object and provides an indication of the storage location of the data object which may be used to generate a data object identifier associated with the data object. As another example in an embodiment storage allocator uses information stored in storage node registrar store to create and place volume components for new volumes in specific storage nodes to satisfy isolation and fault tolerance constraints. As yet another example in an embodiment anti entropy watcher uses information stored in storage node registrar store to detect entropic effects such as data loss hardware failure and the like.

In some embodiments data plane also includes an orphan cleanup data store which is used to track orphans in the storage system. As used herein an orphan is a stored data object that is not referenced by any external entity. In various embodiments orphan cleanup data store may be implemented by a NoSQL data management system such as a key value data store an RDBMS or any other data storage system. In some embodiments storage node registrars stores object placement information in orphan cleanup data store . Subsequently information stored in orphan cleanup data store may be compared for example by an anti entropy watcher with information maintained in metadata plane . If an orphan is detected in some embodiments a request is inserted in the common control plane to delete the orphan.

Referring now to metadata plane illustrated in . In various embodiments metadata plane provides information about data objects stored in the system for inventory and accounting purposes to satisfy customer metadata inquiries and the like. In the illustrated embodiment metadata plane includes a metadata manager job store which stores information about executed transactions based on entries from job result queue in common control plane . In various embodiments metadata manager job store may be implemented by a NoSQL data management system such as a key value data store a RDBMS or any other data storage system. In some embodiments metadata manager job store is partitioned and sub partitioned for example based on logical data containers to facilitate parallel processing by multiple instances of services such as metadata manager .

In the illustrative embodiment metadata plane also includes one or more metadata managers for generating a cold index of data objects e.g. stored in cold index store based on records in metadata manager job store . As used herein a cold index refers to an index that is updated infrequently. In various embodiments a cold index is maintained to reduce cost overhead. In some embodiments multiple metadata managers may periodically read and process records from different partitions in metadata manager job store in parallel and store the result in a cold index store .

In some embodiments cold index store may be implemented by a reliable and durable data storage service. In some embodiments cold index store is configured to handle metadata requests initiated by customers. For example a customer may issue a request to list all data objects contained in a given logical data container. In response to such a request cold index store may provide a list of identifiers of all data objects contained in the logical data container based on information maintained by cold index . In some embodiments an operation may take a relative long period of time and the customer may be provided a job identifier to retrieve the result when the job is done. In other embodiments cold index store is configured to handle inquiries from other services for example from front end for inventory accounting and billing purposes.

In some embodiments metadata plane may also include a container metadata store that stores information about logical data containers such as container ownership policies usage and the like. Such information may be used for example by front end services to perform authorization metering accounting and the like. In various embodiments container metadata store may be implemented by a NoSQL data management system such as a key value data store a RDBMS or any other data storage system.

As described herein in various embodiments the archival data storage system described herein is implemented to be efficient and scalable. For example in an embodiment batch processing and request coalescing is used at various stages e.g. front end request handling control plane job request handling data plane data request handling to improve efficiency. For another example in an embodiment processing of metadata such as jobs requests and the like are partitioned so as to facilitate parallel processing of the partitions by multiple instances of services.

In an embodiment data elements stored in the archival data storage system such as data components volumes described below are self describing so as to avoid the need for a global index data structure. For example in an embodiment data objects stored in the system may be addressable by data object identifiers that encode storage location information. For another example in an embodiment volumes may store information about which data objects are stored in the volume and storage nodes and devices storing such volumes may collectively report their inventory and hardware information to provide a global view of the data stored in the system such as evidenced by information stored in storage node registrar store . In such an embodiment the global view is provided for efficiency only and not required to locate data stored in the system.

In various embodiments the archival data storage system described herein is implemented to improve data reliability and durability. For example in an embodiment a data object is redundantly encoded into a plurality of data components and stored across different data storage entities to provide fault tolerance. For another example in an embodiment data elements have multiple levels of integrity checks. In an embodiment parent child relations always have additional information to ensure full referential integrity. For example in an embodiment bulk data transmission and storage paths are protected by having the initiator pre calculate the digest on the data before transmission and subsequently supply the digest with the data to a receiver. The receiver of the data transmission is responsible for recalculation comparing and then acknowledging to the sender that includes the recalculated the digest. Such data integrity checks may be implemented for example by front end services transient data storage services data plane storage entities and the like described above.

In an embodiment a data object identifier may also encode information used to validate or authorize subsequent customer requests. For example a data object identifier may encode the identifier of the logical data container that the data object is stored in. In a subsequent request to retrieve this data object the logical data container identifier may be used to determine whether the requesting entity has access to the logical data container and hence the data objects contained therein. In some embodiments the data object identifier may encode information based on information supplied by a customer e.g. a global unique identifier GUID for the data object and the like and or information collected or calculated by the system performing process e.g. storage location information .

In an embodiment providing a data object identifier may include determining a storage location for the before the data is actually stored there. For example such determination may be based at least in part on inventory information about existing data storage entities such as operational status e.g. active or inactive available storage space data isolation requirement and the like. In an environment such as environment illustrated by such determination may be implemented by a service such as storage node registrar as described above in connection with . In some embodiments such determination may include allocating new storage space e.g. volume on one or more physical storage devices by a service such as storage allocator as described in connection with .

In an embodiment a storage location identifier may be generated to represent the storage location determined above. Such a storage location identifier may include for example a volume reference object which comprises a volume identifier component and data object identifier component. The volume reference component may identify the volume the data is stored on and the data object identifier component may identify where in the volume the data is stored. In general the storage location identifier may comprise components that identify various levels within a logical or physical data storage topology such as a hierarchy in which data is organized. In some embodiments the storage location identifier may point to where actual payload data is stored or a chain of reference to where the data is stored.

In an embodiments a data object identifier encodes a digest e.g. a hash of at least a portion of the data to be stored such as the payload data. In some embodiments the digest may be based at least in part on a customer provided digest. In other embodiments the digest may be calculated from scratch based on the payload data.

In an embodiment process includes creating a storage job for persisting data to a long term data store and scheduling the storage job for execution. In environment as described in connection with steps and may be implemented at least in part by components of control plane for direct I O and common control plane as described above. Specifically in an embodiment job tracker creates a job record and stores the job record in job tracker store . As described above job tracker may perform batch processing to reduce the total number of transactions against job tracker store . Additionally job tracker store may be partitioned or otherwise optimized to facilitate parallel processing cleanup operations and the like.

In some embodiments a storage job may be created before a data object identifier is generated and or provided. For example a storage job identifier instead of or in addition to a data object identifier may be provided in response to a storage request at step above.

In an embodiment scheduling the storage job for execution includes performing job planning and optimization such as queue based load leveling or balancing job partitioning and the like as described in connection with common control plane of . For example in an embodiment job request balancer transfers job items from job request queue to storage node manager job store according to a scheduling algorithm so as to dampen peak to average load levels jobs coming from control plane for I O and to deliver manageable workload to data plane . As another example storage node manager job store may be partitioned to facilitate parallel processing of the jobs by multiple workers such as storage node managers . As yet another example storage node manager job store may provide querying sorting and other functionalities to facilitate batch processing and other job optimizations.

In an embodiment process includes selecting the storage job for execution for example by a storage node manager from storage node manager job stored as described in connection with . The storage job may be selected with other jobs for batch processing or otherwise selected as a result of job planning and optimization described above.

In an embodiment process includes obtaining data from a staging store such as payload data cache described above in connection with . In some embodiments the integrity of the data may be checked for example by verifying the size digest an error detection code and the like.

In an embodiment process includes obtaining one or more data encoding schemes such as an encryption scheme a redundancy encoding scheme such as erasure encoding redundant array of independent disks RAID encoding schemes replication and the like. In some embodiments such encoding schemes evolve to adapt to different requirements. For example encryption keys may be rotated periodically and stretch factor of an erasure coding scheme may be adjusted over time to different hardware configurations redundancy requirements and the like.

In an embodiment process includes encoding with the obtained encoding schemes. For example in an embodiment data is encrypted and the encrypted data is erasure encoded. In an embodiment storage node managers described in connection with may be configured to perform the data encoding described herein. In an embodiment application of such encoding schemes generates a plurality of encoded data components or shards which may be stored across different storage entities such as storage devices storage nodes datacenters and the like to provide fault tolerance. In an embodiment where data may comprise multiple parts such as in the case of a multi part upload each part may be encoded and stored as described herein.

In an embodiment process includes determining the storage entities for such encoded data components. For example in an environment illustrated by a storage node manager may determine the plurality of storage nodes to store the encoded data components by querying a storage node registrar using a volume identifier. Such a volume identifier may be part of a storage location identifier associated with the data to be stored. In response to the query with a given volume identifier in an embodiment storage node registrar returns a list of network locations including endpoints DNS names IP addresses and the like of storage nodes to store the encoded data components. As described in connection with storage node registrar may determine such a list based on self reported and dynamically provided and or updated inventory information from storage nodes themselves. In some embodiments such determination is based on data isolation fault tolerance load balancing power conservation data locality and other considerations. In some embodiments storage registrar may cause new storage space to be allocated for example by invoking storage allocator as described in connection with .

In an embodiment process includes causing storage of the encoded data component s at the determined storage entities. For example in an environment illustrated by a storage node manager may request each of the storage nodes determined above to store a data component at a given storage location. Each of the storage nodes upon receiving the storage request from storage node manager to store a data component may cause the data component to be stored in a connected storage device. In some embodiments at least a portion of the data object identifier is stored with all or some of the data components in either encoded or unencoded form. For example the data object identifier may be stored in the header of each data component and or in a volume component index stored in a volume component. In some embodiments a storage node may perform batch processing or other optimizations to process requests from storage node managers .

In an embodiment a storage node sends an acknowledgement to the requesting storage node manager indicating whether data is stored successfully. In some embodiments a storage node returns an error message when for some reason the request cannot be fulfilled. For example if a storage node receives two requests to store to the same storage location one or both requests may fail. In an embodiment a storage node performs validation checks prior to storing the data and returns an error if the validation checks fail. For example data integrity may be verified by checking an error detection code or a digest. As another example storage node may verify for example based on a volume index that the volume identified by a storage request is stored by the storage node and or that the volume has sufficient space to store the data component.

In some embodiments data storage is considered successful when storage node manager receives positive acknowledgement from at least a subset a storage quorum of requested storage nodes . In some embodiments a storage node manager may wait until the receipt of a quorum of acknowledgement before removing the state necessary to retry the job. Such state information may include encoded data components for which an acknowledgement has not been received. In other embodiments to improve the throughput a storage node manager may remove the state necessary to retry the job before receiving a quorum of acknowledgement

In an embodiment process includes updating metadata information including for example metadata maintained by data plane such as index and storage space information for a storage device mapping information stored at storage node registrar store and the like metadata maintained by control planes and such as job related information metadata maintained by metadata plane such as a cold index and the like. In various embodiments some of such metadata information may be updated via batch processing and or on a periodic basis to reduce performance and cost impact. For example in data plane information maintained by storage node registrar store may be updated to provide additional mapping of the volume identifier of the newly stored data and the storage nodes on which the data components are stored if such a mapping is not already there. For another example volume index on storage devices may be updated to reflect newly added data components.

In common control plane job entries for completed jobs may be removed from storage node manager job store and added to job result queue as described in connection with . In control plane for direct I O statuses of job records in job tracker store may be updated for example by job tracker which monitors the job result queue . In various embodiments a job that fails to complete may be retried for a number of times. For example in an embodiment a new job may be created to store the data at a different location. As another example an existing job record e.g. in storage node manager job store job tracker store and the like may be updated to facilitate retry of the same job.

In metadata plane metadata may be updated to reflect the newly stored data. For example completed jobs may be pulled from job result queue into metadata manager job store and batch processed by metadata manager to generate an updated index such as stored in cold index store . For another example customer information may be updated to reflect changes for metering and accounting purposes.

Finally in some embodiments once a storage job is completed successfully job records payload data and other data associated with a storage job may be removed for example by a cleanup agent as described in connection with . In some embodiments such removal may be processed by batch processing parallel processing or the like.

In an embodiment process includes receiving a data retrieval request to retrieve data such as stored by process described above. Such a data retrieval request may include a data object identifier such as provided by step of process described above or any other information that may be used to identify the data to be retrieved.

In an embodiment process includes processing the data retrieval request upon receiving the request. Such processing may include for example authenticating the customer authorizing requested access against access control policies performing meter and accounting related activities and the like. In an embodiment such processing may be performed by services of front end such as described in connection with . In an embodiment such request may be processed in connection with other requests for example in batch mode.

In an embodiment processing the retrieval request may be based at least in part on the data object identifier that is included in the retrieval request. As described above data object identifier may encode storage location information payload validation information such as size creation timestamp payload digest and the like metadata validation information policy information and the like. In an embodiment processing the retrieval request includes decoding the information encoded in the data object identifier for example using a private cryptographic key and using at least some of the decoded information to validate the retrieval request. For example policy information may include access control information that may be used to validate that the requesting entity of the retrieval request has the required permission to perform the requested access. As another example metadata validation information may include an error detection code such as a cyclic redundancy check CRC that may be used to verify the integrity of data object identifier or a component of it.

In an embodiment process includes creating a data retrieval job corresponding to the data retrieval request and providing a job identifier associated with the data retrieval job for example in a response to the data retrieval request. In some embodiments creating a data retrieval job is similar to creating a data storage job as described in connection with step of process illustrated in . For example in an embodiment a job tracker may create a job record that includes at least some information encoded in the data object identifier and or additional information such as a job expiration time and the like and store the job record in job tracker store . As described above job tracker may perform batch processing to reduce the total number of transactions against job tracker store . Additionally job tracker store may be partitioned or otherwise optimized to facilitate parallel processing cleanup operations and the like.

In an embodiment process includes scheduling the data retrieval job created above. In some embodiments scheduling the data retrieval job for execution includes performing job planning and optimization such as described in connection with step of process of . For example the data retrieval job may be submitted into a job queue and scheduled for batch processing with other jobs based at least in part on costs power management schedules and the like. For another example the data retrieval job may be coalesced with other retrieval jobs based on data locality and the like.

In an embodiment process includes selecting the data retrieval job for execution for example by a storage node manager from storage node manager job stored as described in connection with . The retrieval job may be selected with other jobs for batch processing or otherwise selected as a result of job planning and optimization described above.

In an embodiment process includes determining the storage entities that store the encoded data components that are generated by a storage process such as process described above. In an embodiment a storage node manager may determine a plurality of storage nodes to retrieve the encoded data components in a manner similar to that discussed in connection with step of process above. For example such determination may be based on load balancing power conservation efficiency and other considerations.

In an embodiment process includes determining one or more data decoding schemes that may be used to decode retrieved data. Typically such decoding schemes correspond to the encoding schemes applied to the original data when the original data is previously stored. For example such decoding schemes may include decryption with a cryptographic key erasure decoding and the like.

In an embodiment process includes causing retrieval of at least some of the encoded data components from the storage entities determined in step of process . For example in an environment illustrated by a storage node manager responsible for the data retrieval job may request a subset of storage nodes determined above to retrieve their corresponding data components. In some embodiments a minimum number of encoded data components is needed to reconstruct the original data where the number may be determined based at least in part on the data redundancy scheme used to encode the data e.g. stretch factor of an erasure coding . In such embodiments the subset of storage nodes may be selected such that no less than the minimum number of encoded data components is retrieved.

Each of the subset of storage nodes upon receiving a request from storage node manager to retrieve a data component may validate the request for example by checking the integrity of a storage location identifier that is part of the data object identifier verifying that the storage node indeed holds the requested data component and the like. Upon a successful validation the storage node may locate the data component based at least in part on the storage location identifier. For example as described above the storage location identifier may include a volume reference object which comprises a volume identifier component and a data object identifier component where the volume reference component to identify the volume the data is stored and a data object identifier component may identify where in the volume the data is stored. In an embodiment the storage node reads the data component for example from a connected data storage device and sends the retrieved data component to the storage node manager that requested the retrieval. In some embodiments the data integrity is checked for example by verifying the data component identifier or a portion thereof is identical to that indicated by the data component identifier associated with the retrieval job. In some embodiments a storage node may perform batching or other job optimization in connection with retrieval of a data component.

In an embodiment process includes decoding at least the minimum number of the retrieved encoded data components with the one or more data decoding schemes determined at step of process . For example in one embodiment the retrieved data components may be erasure decoded and then decrypted. In some embodiments a data integrity check is performed on the reconstructed data for example using payload integrity validation information encoded in the data object identifier e.g. size timestamp digest . In some cases the retrieval job may fail due to a less than minimum number of retrieved data components failure of data integrity check and the like. In such cases the retrieval job may be retried in a fashion similar to that described in connection with . In some embodiments the original data comprises multiple parts of data and each part is encoded and stored. In such embodiments during retrieval the encoded data components for each part of the data may be retrieved and decoded e.g. erasure decoded and decrypted to form the original part and the decoded parts may be combined to form the original data.

In an embodiment process includes storing reconstructed data in a staging store such as payload data cache described in connection with . In some embodiments data stored in the staging store may be available for download by a customer for a period of time or indefinitely. In an embodiment data integrity may be checked e.g. using a digest before the data is stored in the staging store.

In an embodiment process includes providing a notification of the completion of the retrieval job to the requestor of the retrieval request or another entity or entities otherwise configured to receive such a notification. Such notifications may be provided individually or in batches. In other embodiments the status of the retrieval job may be provided upon a polling request for example from a customer.

In an embodiment process includes receiving a data deletion request to delete data such as stored by process described above. Such a data retrieval request may include a data object identifier such as provided by step of process described above or any other information that may be used to identify the data to be deleted.

In an embodiment process includes processing the data deletion request upon receiving the request. In some embodiments the processing is similar to that for step of process and step of process described above. For example in an embodiment the processing is based at least in part on the data object identifier that is included in the data deletion request.

In an embodiment process includes creating a data retrieval job corresponding to the data deletion request. Such a retrieval job may be created similar to the creation of storage job described in connection with step of process and the creation of the retrieval job described in connection with step of process .

In an embodiment process includes providing an acknowledgement that the data is deleted. In some embodiments such acknowledgement may be provided in response to the data deletion request so as to provide a perception that the data deletion request is handled synchronously. In other embodiments a job identifier associated with the data deletion job may be provided similar to the providing of job identifiers for data retrieval requests.

In an embodiment process includes scheduling the data deletion job for execution. In some embodiments scheduling of data deletion jobs may be implemented similar to that described in connection with step of process and in connection with step of process described above. For example data deletion jobs for closely located data may be coalesced and or batch processed. For another example data deletion jobs may be assigned a lower priority than data retrieval jobs.

In some embodiments data stored may have an associated expiration time that is specified by a customer or set by default. In such embodiments a deletion job may be created and schedule automatically on or near the expiration time of the data. In some embodiments the expiration time may be further associated with a grace period during which data is still available or recoverable. In some embodiments a notification of the pending deletion may be provided before on or after the expiration time.

In some embodiments process includes selecting the data deletion job for execution for example by a storage node manager from storage node manager job stored as described in connection with . The deletion job may be selected with other jobs for batch processing or otherwise selected as a result of job planning and optimization described above.

In some embodiments process includes determining the storage entities for data components that store the data components that are generated by a storage process such as process described above. In an embodiment a storage node manager may determine a plurality of storage nodes to retrieve the encoded data components in a manner similar to that discussed in connection with step of process described above.

In some embodiments process includes causing the deletion of at least some of the data components. For example in an environment illustrated by a storage node manager responsible for the data deletion job may identify a set of storage nodes that store the data components for the data to be deleted and requests at least a subset of those storage nodes to delete their respective data components. Each of the subset of storage node upon receiving a request from storage node manager to delete a data component may validate the request for example by checking the integrity of a storage location identifier that is part of the data object identifier verifying that the storage node indeed holds the requested data component and the like. Upon a successful validation the storage node may delete the data component from a connected storage device and sends an acknowledgement to storage node manager indicating whether the operation was successful. In an embodiment multiple data deletion jobs may be executed in a batch such that data objects located close together may be deleted as a whole. In some embodiments data deletion is considered successful when storage node manager receives positive acknowledgement from at least a subset of storage nodes . The size of the subset may be configured to ensure that data cannot be reconstructed later on from undeleted data components. Failed or incomplete data deletion jobs may be retried in a manner similar to the retrying of data storage jobs and data retrieval jobs described in connection with process and process respectively.

In an embodiment process includes updating metadata information such as that described in connection with step of process . For example storage nodes executing the deletion operation may update storage information including index free space information and the like. In an embodiment storage nodes may provide updates to storage node registrar or storage node registrar store. In various embodiments some of such metadata information may be updated via batch processing and or on a periodic basis to reduce performance and cost impact.

In some aspects a controller may be configured to control one or more hard drives . . . N collectively hard drives . By way of example only the hard drives are illustrated in an array or ordered list however any ordering and or other organization may be envisioned for determining which particular hard drives or sets of hard drives come before or after other particular hard drives or sets of hard drives . For example the array may be utilized by the controller for pointing to a next hard drive to activate e.g. based at least in part on some logical mapping and not for ordering the hard drives . However in other examples the array may be utilized to dynamically order the hard drives e.g. when an on demand rotation schedule is implemented .

In some examples a window or sliding scale may be envisioned for activating the hard drives . Based at least in part on a predefined period of time the window may move along the array to become windows and for example at each period. In other words the window may represent the hard drives that are active or are to be activated by the controller during a first period. That is by way of example and not limitation during the first period the hard drives may be active i.e. provided power or taken out of sleep mode . In the example shown in at the end of the first period the window may move to become the window where hard drives become active. In some examples when the transition occurs i.e. the window slides the hard drive may be powered down prior to the controller activating the hard drive . In this way the power draw associated with operating the array of hard drives may not exceed a certain level.

Additionally in some aspects the windows may be defined by a length . The length may be determined based at least in part on demand a percentage of the total hard drives a predetermined number of the total hard drives some predetermined level of power consumption temperature cost etc. or the like. In addition the window may be configured to minimize power consumption of the hard drives minimize operational costs associated with the hard drives and or maximize the operational lifetime of the hard drives e.g. how long the hard drives will work before failing or otherwise being serviced being repaired or being replaced . As such the length may be constant throughout the rotation schedule or it may be dynamic. In some examples once the window reaches the end of the array of hard drives the window may cycle back to the beginning. Pictorially this may be represented as a circular array where the hard drive would follow the hard drive N . Further in some examples an array as shown in may not be used at all. Instead any other form or type of data structure may be utilized to organize the hard drives in such a way that the rotation schedule may determine and or control which hard drives are to be activated at what times. Additionally each of the hard drives may actually be a group of one or more hard drives instead of a single drive. In this scenario the controller may be further configured to stagger the activation of each single hard drive within the group of hard drives such as to limit power spikes or other potential power consumption issues.

In some examples the hard drives may be arranged in a logical order such as shown with the array . The hard drives may also be arranged in a server or on a rack in a physical order that may be different from the logical order such as shown with illustrative physical rack . That is the hard drives may actually be located on the physical rack in the order shown as opposed to the order shown in the logical array . Thus as the schedule moves the window along the logical order the hard drives may be activated or otherwise powered up based at least in part on their logical order and or their physical location. Additionally a matrix may indicate which hard drives are activated at each unit of time according to the schedule . In some examples each row or column of the matrix may represent physical racks in a server or cabinet such that adjacent rows may represent adjacent racks. Additionally in some examples one or more constraints may be provided and or implemented such that an even or other distribution of hard drives on the matrix may be ensured. For example in order to evenly distribute the enabled hard drives the conditions or constraints may indicate that hard drives of a particular temperate age location amount of vibration or the like may not be activated that are within a particular distance of other hard drives of the matrix . For example the schedule may indicate that a particular hard drive is to be activated however the condition may instruct the archival data storage service to modify the indication or provide an instruction to activate a different hard drive instead.

As described with reference to in some aspects the total number of hard drives may be divided into a predefined number of groups. Then these groups may be rotated in and out of operation based at least in part on the rotation schedule . Such an approach may allow the storage node registrars to determine when and where to place new write operations or when it may be possible to execute read or delete operations. In some examples the data storage node managers may be isolated from this knowledge and may follow directions from the storage node registrars . However in other examples the rotation schedule may be determined on demand. For example based at least in part on read requests from one or more data storage node managers a storage node registrar may select a number of the hard drives that should come in to a rotation and then send messages to the data storage nodes. Alternatively the data storage node manager may directly contact the data storage nodes. In some examples particular constraints may influence the rotation schedule including but not limited to a goal not to starve for too long a request to a drive which has only one read request outstanding.

Additionally some any or all of the processes may be performed under the control of one or more computer systems configured with executable instructions and may be implemented as code e.g. executable instructions one or more computer programs or one or more applications executing collectively on one or more processors by hardware or combinations thereof. As noted above the code may be stored on a computer readable storage medium for example in the form of a computer program comprising a plurality of instructions executable by one or more processors. The computer readable storage medium may be non transitory.

In some aspects the storage node manager the storage nodes the storage node registrar store and or other data storage devices or collections of the archival data storage service shown in may perform the process of . The process may begin with classification of one or more data storage devices of the archival data storage service into groups at . In some examples each group may be a subset or part of a subset of the data storage devices. Additionally classifying may involve determining an amount or percentage of storage devices to be grouped together based at least in part on characteristics of the storage devices such as but not limited to location power consumption age speed cost etc. At the process may include modifying a power state of the groups according to a schedule. The schedule may be configured to ensure that on average an amount of the data storage devices are in a power down state. The power down state may be a low power state a sleep mode a powering down state off or the like. Additionally the amount of devices to be in a power down state may be based at least in part on a desired level of power consumption and or cost associated with operating the archival data storage service . Further in some examples the schedule may be received or otherwise based at least in part on the storage node registrar store the storage node registrar and or the data storage node.

In some examples the process may also include obtaining a batch of data processing requests at . The data processing requests may be part of a batch or finite grouping of requests or they may be part of a queue for more synchronous operation. Additionally the batch of requests may include read requests index list requests write requests delete requests or the like. At the process may include processing the batch requests. In some examples processing the requests at may include identifying a storage device in a power down state that when powered on would be usable to service the request at . Additionally processing the requests at may also include servicing the request when the group containing the identified storage device e.g. from is modified according to the schedule to be in the power up state at . That is once the identified storage device is powered up or otherwise enabled the archival data storage service may service the request e.g. read data from the storage device or delete data from the storage device . Additionally in some cases the actions of and or may be processed as a single action two actions or three separate actions. In some examples the process may end at . However in other example the process may end with powering down a group of storage devices in the power up state. Alternatively or in addition the process may include powering down the group of storage devices in the power up state prior to powering up the group including the identified storage device and or prior to servicing the request at .

The process may also include identifying one or more data processing requests of a batch of requests associated with the storage devices at . As noted above the requests may be received in a single batch. Additionally the requests may be processed in a batch at . However in some examples the requests may be received in a batch and processed sequentially yet no new requests may be received until the archival data storage service has completed some or all of the requests of the batch. At the process may include identifying a data storage device in a low power mode that is able to service the request when powered up. Further the process may end with service of the request once the identified storage device is powered up based on the schedule. In this way the schedule may control the power management of the storage devices while at the same time the batch of requests may influence the schedule. In this way the data storage power management described herein may be considered on demand. Additionally in some aspects the processing of the data processing requests at may include the actions of and or . As such they may all be performed in a single action.

Illustrative methods and systems for validating the integrity of data are described above. Some or all of these systems and methods may but need not be implemented at least partially by architectures such as those shown above.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HTML XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the Web server. It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store also is shown to include a mechanism for storing log data which can be used for reporting analysis or other such purposes. It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as for page image information and to access right information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.
