This invention relates to novel pharmaceutically useful compounds which compounds are useful as inhibitors of protein or lipid kinases such as inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3 OH kinase PI3 kinase family particularly the PI3K class I sub type . The compounds may also be useful as inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR and may optionally also be useful as inhibitors of a PIM family kinase e.g. PIM 3 and especially PIM 1 . The compounds are of potential utility in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. The invention also relates to the use of such compounds as medicaments to the use of such compounds for in vitro in situ and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells or associated pathological conditions to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to synthetic routes for their production.

The malfunctioning of protein kinases PKs is the hallmark of numerous diseases. A large share of the oncogenes and proto oncogenes involved in human cancers code for PKs. The enhanced activities of PKs are also implicated in many non malignant diseases such as benign prostate hyperplasia familial adenomatosis polyposis neuro fibromatosis psoriasis vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis pulmonary fibrosis arthritis glomerulonephritis and post surgical stenosis and restenosis. PKs are also implicated in inflammatory conditions and in the multiplication of viruses and parasites. PKs may also play a major role in the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative disorders.

Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases PI3Ks are a family of lipid and serine threonine kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol PI on the 3 OH of the inositol ring to produce phosphoinositol 3 phosphate PIP phosphoinositol 3 4 diphosphate PIP and phosphoinositol 3 4 5 triphosphate PIP which act as recruitment sites for various intracellular signalling proteins which in turn form signalling complexes to relay extracellular signals to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. These 3 phosphoinositide subtypes function as second messengers in intra cellular signal transduction pathways see e.g. Trends Biochem. Sci 22 87 267 72 1997 by Vanhaesebroeck et al. Chem. Rev. 101 8 2365 80 2001 by Leslie et al 2001 Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Boil. 17 615 75 2001 by Katso et al and Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 59 5 761 79 2002 by Toker et al .

Multiple PI3K isoforms categorized by their catalytic subunits their regulation by corresponding regulatory subunits expression patterns and signalling specific funtions p110 perform this enzymatic reaction Exp. Cell. Res. 25 1 . 239 54 1999 by Vanhaesebroeck and Katso et al. 2001 above .

The closely related isoforms p110 and are ubiquitously expressed while and are more specifically expressed in the haematopoietic cell system smooth muscle cells myocytes and endothelial cells see e.g. Trends Biochem. Sci. 22 7 267 72 1997 by Vanhaesebroeck et al . Their expression might also be regulated in an inducible manner depending on the cellular tissue type and stimuli as well as disease context. Inductibility of protein expression includes synthesis of protein as well as protein stabilization that is in part regulated by association with regulatory subunits.

Eight mammalian PI3Ks have been identified so far including four class I PI3Ks. Class Ia includes PI3K PI3K and PI3K . All of the class Ia enzymes are heterodimeric complexes comprising a catalytic subunit p110 p110 or p110 associated with an SH2 domain containing p85 adapter subunit. Class Ia PI3Ks are activated through tyrosine kinase signalling and are involved in cell proliferation and survival. PI3K and PI3K have also been implicated in tumorigenesis in a variety of human cancers. Thus pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and PI3K are useful for treating various types of cancer.

The potential role of PI3K over signaling in the development of lymphoid malignancies was initially identified in an experiment by Borlado et al. Borlado L R Redondo C Alvarez B et al. Increased phosphoinositide 3 kinase activity induces a lymphoproliferative disorder and contributes to tumor generation in vivo. FASEB J 2000 14 7 895 903 . In that study a mouse model with PI3K over signaling developed infiltrating lymphoproliferative disorders as well as autoimmune disease. The PI3K pathway plays an important role in the development of B cell malignancies mainly through activation of the p110 subunit. Inhibition of p110 could have a role in the management of B cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL plasma cell myeloma PCM and Hodgkin s lymphoma HL . for a review see Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 January 21 1 15 22. CAL 101 a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase p110 delta inhibitor for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Castillo J J Furman M Winer E S .

PI3K the only member of the Class Ib PI3Ks consists of a catalytic subunit p110 which is associated with a p110 regulatory subunit. PI3K is regulated by G protein coupled receptors GPCRs via association with subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. PI3K is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells and cardiomyocytes and is involved in inflammation and mast cell function. Thus pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K are useful for treating a variety of inflammatory diseases allergies and cardiovascular diseases.

These observations show that deregulation of phosphoinositol 3 kinase and the upstream and downstream components of this signalling pathway is one of the most common deregulations associated with human cancers and proliferative diseases see e.g. Parsons et al. Nature 436 792 2005 Hennessey et al. Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 4 988 1004 2005 .

The mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR also known as FK506 binding protein 12 rapamycin associated protein 1 FRAP1 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the FRAP1 gene. mTOR is a serine threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth cell proliferation cell motility cell survival protein synthesis and transcription. The inhibition of mTORs are believed to be useful for treating various diseases conditions such as cancer for example as described in Easton et al. 2006 . mTOR and cancer therapy . 25 48 6436 46 .

The listing or discussion of an apparently prior published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.

For the treatment of cancer targeted therapies are becoming more important. That is therapy that has the effect of interfering with specific target molecules that are linked to tumor growth and or carcinogenesis. Such therapy may be more effective than current treatments e.g. chemotherapy and less harmful to normal cells e.g. because chemotherapy has the potential to kill normal cells as well as cancerous cells . This and also the fact that targeted therapies may be selective i.e. it may inhibit a certain targeted molecule more selectively as compared to other molecular targets e.g. as described hereinafter may have the benefit of reducing side effects and may also have the benefit that certain specific cancers can be treated also selectively . The latter may in turn also reduce side effects.

PIM 1 is the protooncogene activated by murine leucemia virus Provirus Integration site for Moloney murine leucemia virus MoMuLV that induces T cell lymphoma Cuypers H. T. et. al. 1984 37 141 150 .

The expression of the protooncogene produces a non transmembrane serine threonine kinase of 313 residues including a kinase domain consisting of 253 amino acid residues. Two isoforms are known through alternative initiation p44 and p33 Saris C. J. M. et al. 1991 10 655 664 .

PIM 1 PIM 2 and PIM 3 phosphorylate protein substrates that are important in cancer neogenesis and progression. For example PIM 1 phosphorylates inter alia p21 Bad c myb Cdc 25A and eIF4B see e.g. Quian K. C. et al 2005 280 7 6130 6137 and references cited therein .

Two PIM 1 homologs have been described Baytel D. 1998 1442 274 285 Feldman J. et al. 1998 273 16535.16543 . PIM 2 and PIM 3 are respectively 58 and 69 identical to PIM 1 at the amino acid level. PIM 1 is mainly expressed in thymus testis and cells of the hematopoietic system Mikkers H. Nawijn M. Allen J. Brouwers C. Verhoeven E. Jonkers J. Berns 2004 24 6104 Bachmann M. Moroy T. 2005 37 726 730. 6115 . PIM 1 expression is directly induced by STAT Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription transcription factors and PIM 1 expression is induced by many cytokine signalling pathways such as interleukins IL granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF and interferon erythropoietin and prolactin Wang Z et al. 2001 2 167 179 .

PIM 1 has been implicated in lymphoma development. Induced expression of PIM 1 and the protooncogene c myc synergise to increase the incidence of lymphomagenesis Breuer M. et al. Nature 1989 340 61 63 van Lohuizen M. et al. Cell 1991 65 737 752 . PIM 1 functions in cytokine signalling pathways and has been shown to play a role in T cell development Schmidt T. et al. EMBO J. 1998 17 5349 5359 Jacobs H. et al. JEM 1999 190 1059 1068 . Signalling through gp130 a subunit common to receptors of the IL 6 cytokine family activates the transcription factor STAT3 and can lead to the proliferation of hematopioetic cells Hirano T. et al. Oncogene 2000 19 2548 2556 . A kinase active PIM 1 appears to be essential for the gp130 mediated STAT3 proliferation signal. In cooperation with the c myc PIM 1 can promote STAT3 mediated cell cycle progression and antiapoptosis Shirogane T. et sl. immunity 1999 11 709 719 . PIM 1 also appears to be necessary for IL 3 stimulated growth in bone marrow derived mast cells Domen J. et al. Blood 1993 82 1445 1452 and survival of FDCP1 cells after IL 3 withdrawal Lilly M. et al. Oncogene 1999 18 4022 4031 .

Additionally control of cell proliferation and survival by PIM 1 may be effected by means of its phosphorylation of the well established cell cycle regulators cdc25 Mochizuki T. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1999 274 18659 18666 and or p21 Cip1 WAF1 Wang Z. et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2002 1593 45 55 or phosphorylation of heterochromatin protein 1 a molecule involved in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation Koike N. et al FEBS Lett. 2000 467 17 21 .

Mice deficient for all three PIM genes showed an impaired response to hematopoietic growth factors and demonstrated that PIM proteins are required for efficient proliferation of peripheral T lymphocyes. In particular it was shown that PIM function is required for efficient cell cycle induction of T cells in response to synergistic T cell receptor and IL 2 signalling. A large number of interaction partners and substrates of PIM 1 have been identified suggesting a pivotal role for PIM 1 in cell cycle control proliferation as well as in cell survival.

The oncogenic potential of this kinase has been first demonstrated in E PIM 1 transgenic mice in which PIM 1 over expression is targeted to the B cell lineage which leads to formation of B cell tumors van Lohuizen M. et al. 1989 56 673 682. Subsequently PIM 1 has been reported to be over expressed in a number of prostate cancers erythroleukemias and several other types of human leukemias Roh M. et al. 2003 63 8079 8084 Valdman A. et al 2004 60 367 371 

For example chromosomal translocation of PIM 1 leads to overexpression of PIM 1 in diffuse large cell lymphoma. Akasaka H. et al. 2000 60 2335 2341 . Furthermore a number of missense mutations in PIM 1 have been reported in lymphomas of the nervous system and AIDS induced non Hodgkins lymphomas that probably affect PIM 1 kinase activity or stability Pasqualucci L. et al 2001 412 341 346 Montesinos Rongen M. et al. 2004 103 1869 1875 Gaidano G. et al. 2003 102 1833 184 . Thus the strong linkage between reported overexpression data and the occurrence of PIM 1 mutations in cancer suggests a dominant role of PIM 1 in tumorigenesis.

Several other protein kinases have been described in the literature in which the activity and or elevated activity of such protein kinases have been implicated in diseases such as cancer in a similar manner to PIM 1 PIM 2 and PIM 3.

It has also been reported that PIM 1 has a role in pulmonary artery hypertension PAH see the journal article by Paulin et al. Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 PIM 1 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of human pulmonary arterial hypertension .

There is a constant need to provide alternative and or more efficacious inhibitors of protein kinases and particularly inhibitors of PIM 1 PIM 2 and or PIM 3. Such modulators are expected to offer alternative and or improved approaches for the management of medical conditions associated with activity and or elevated activity of PIM 1 PIM 2 and or PIM 3 protein kinases.

For the treatment of cancer targeted therapies are becoming more important. That is therapy that has the effect of interfering with specific target molecules that are linked to tumor growth and or carcinogenesis. Such therapy may be more effective than current treatments e.g. chemotherapy and less harmful to normal cells e.g. because chemotherapy has the potential to kill normal cells as well as cancerous cells . This and also the fact that targeted therapies may be selective i.e. it may inhibit a certain targeted molecule more selectively as compared to other molecular targets e.g. as described hereinafter may have the benefit of reducing side effects and may also have the benefit that certain specific cancers can be treated also selectively . The latter may in turn also reduce side effects.

Hence it is a clear goal of current oncologists to develop targeted therapies e.g. ones that are selective . In this respect it should be pointed out that several different molecular targets may exist that are linked to certain diseases e.g. cancer . However one simply cannot predict if a therapy e.g. a small molecule as a therapeutic that interferes with or inhibits one target molecule could inhibit a different molecular target be it one that will ultimately have the effect of treating the same disease or a different one .

However none of these documents disclose macrocycles.

which compounds esters amides solvates and salts are referred to hereinafter as the compounds of the invention .

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Such salts may be formed by conventional means for example by reaction of a free acid or a free base form of a compound of formula I with one or more equivalents of an appropriate acid or base optionally in a solvent or in a medium in which the salt is insoluble followed by removal of said solvent or said medium using standard techniques e.g. in vacuo by freeze drying or by filtration . Salts may also be prepared by exchanging a counter ion of a compound of the invention in the form of a salt with another counter ion for example using a suitable ion exchange resin.

By pharmaceutically acceptable ester amide solvate or salt thereof we include salts of such an ester or amide and solvates of such an ester amide or salt. For instance pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides such as those defined herein may be mentioned as well as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates or salts.

Pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides of the compounds of the invention are also included within the scope of the invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides of compounds of formula I may have an appropriate group for example an acid group converted to the appropriate ester or amide. For example pharmaceutically acceptable esters of carboxylic acids that may be mentioned include optionally substituted Calkyl Caryl and or Caryl Calkyl esters. Pharmaceutically acceptable amides of carboxylic acids that may be mentioned include those of the formula C O N R R in which Rand Rindependently represent optionally substituted Calkyl Caryl or Caryl Calkylene . Preferably Calkyl groups that may be mentioned in the context of such pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides are not cyclic e.g. linear and or branched.

Preferably specific esters and amides of compounds of the invention that may be mentioned include those esters and amides those mentioned herein in respect of compounds of formula I or compounds of the invention .

Further compounds of the invention that may be mentioned include carbamate carboxamido or ureido derivatives e.g. such derivatives of existing amino functional groups.

For the purposes of this invention therefore prodrugs of compounds of the invention are also included within the scope of the invention.

The term prodrug of a relevant compound of the invention includes any compound that following oral or parenteral administration is metabolised in vivo to form that compound in an experimentally detectable amount and within a predetermined time e.g. within a dosing interval of between 6 and 24 hours i.e. once to four times daily . For the avoidance of doubt the term parenteral administration includes all forms of administration other than oral administration.

Prodrugs of compounds of the invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present on the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. The modifications typically are achieved by synthesising the parent compound with a prodrug substituent. Prodrugs include compounds of the invention wherein a hydroxyl amino sulfhydryl carboxy or carbonyl group in a compound of the invention is bonded to any group that may be cleaved in vivo to regenerate the free hydroxyl amino sulfhydryl carboxy or carbonyl group respectively.

Examples of prodrugs include but are not limited to esters and carbamates of hydroxy functional groups esters groups of carboxyl functional groups N acyl derivatives and N Mannich bases. General information on prodrugs may be found e.g. in Bundegaard H. Design of Prodrugs p. 1 92 Elesevier New York Oxford 1985 .

Compounds of the invention may contain double bonds and may thus exist as E entgegen and Z zusammen geometric isomers about each individual double bond. Positional isomers may also be embraced by the compounds of the invention. All such isomers e.g. if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring the cis and trans forms are embraced and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention e.g. single positional isomers and mixtures of positional isomers may be included within the scope of the invention .

Compounds of the invention may also exhibit tautomerism. All tautomeric forms or tautomers and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention. The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerisations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganisation of some of the bonding electrons.

Compounds of the invention may also contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exhibit optical and or diastereoisomerism. Diastereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The various stereoisomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds using conventional e.g. fractional crystallisation or HPLC techniques. Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate optically active starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation i.e. a chiral pool method by reaction of the appropriate starting material with a chiral auxiliary which can subsequently be removed at a suitable stage by derivatisation i.e. a resolution including a dynamic resolution for example with a homochiral acid followed by separation of the diastereomeric derivatives by conventional means such as chromatography or by reaction with an appropriate chiral reagent or chiral catalyst all under conditions known to the skilled person.

All stereoisomers including but not limited to diastereoisomers enantiomers and atropisomers and mixtures thereof e.g. racemic mixtures are included within the scope of the invention.

In the structures shown herein where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.

The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water ethanol and the like and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.

The present invention also embraces isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature or the most abundant one found in nature . All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified herein are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine such as H H C C C N O O O P P S F Cl I and I. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and for substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated H and carbon 14 C isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O N C and F are useful for positron emission tomography PET studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in e.g. the schemes and or Examples hereinbelow by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Unless otherwise specified Calkyl groups where q is the upper limit of the range defined herein may be straight chain or when there is a sufficient number i.e. a minimum of two or three as appropriate of carbon atoms be branched chain and or cyclic so forming a C cycloalkyl group . Such cycloalkyl groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may further be bridged. Further when there is a sufficient number i.e. a minimum of four of carbon atoms such groups may also be part cyclic. Such alkyl groups may also be saturated or when there is a sufficient number i.e. a minimum of two of carbon atoms be unsaturated forming for example a Calkenyl or a Calkynyl group .

Unless otherwise stated the term Calkylene where q is the upper limit of the range defined herein may be straight chain or when there is a sufficient number of carbon atoms be saturated or unsaturated so forming for example an alkenylene or alkynylene linker group . However such Calkylene groups are preferably not branched. Such alkylene groups may be appropriate linker groups that are a part of the macrocyclic structure of formula I. For the avoidance of doubt any optional substituents on the alkylene groups are not an integral part of the linking moiety i.e. when Y represents substituted alkylene then the substituent s are not linked to X or Z but are located on the alkylene moiety.

Ccycloalkyl groups where q is the upper limit of the range that may be specifically mentioned may be monocyclic or bicyclic alkyl groups which cycloalkyl groups may further be bridged so forming for example fused ring systems such as three fused cycloalkyl groups . Such cycloalkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated containing one or more double or triple bonds forming for example a cycloalkenyl or cycloalkynyl group . Substituents may be attached at any point on the cycloalkyl group. Further where there is a sufficient number i.e. a minimum of four such cycloalkyl groups may also be part cyclic. For the avoidance of doubt optional substituents may also be other cyclic groups which may be attached via a single carbon atom common to both rings so forming a spiro cycle.

Heterocycloalkyl groups that may be mentioned include non aromatic monocyclic and bicyclic heterocycloalkyl groups in which at least one e.g. one to four of the atoms in the ring system is other than carbon i.e. a heteroatom and in which the total number of atoms in the ring system is from five to ten between five and ten . Such heterocycloalkyl groups may also be bridged. Further such heterocycloalkyl groups may be saturated or unsaturated containing one or more double and or triple bonds forming for example a Cheterocycloalkenyl where q is the upper limit of the range or a Cheterocycloalkynyl group. Cheterocycloalkyl groups that may be mentioned include 7 azabicyclo 2.2.1 heptanyl 6 azabicyclo 3.1.1 heptanyl 6 azabicyclo 3.2.1 octanyl 8 azabicyclo 3.2.1 octanyl aziridinyl azetidinyl dihydropyranyl dihydropyridyl dihydropyrrolyl including 2 5 dihydropyrrolyl dioxolanyl including 1 3 dioxolanyl dioxanyl including 1 3 dioxanyl and 1 4 dioxanyl dithianyl including 1 4 dithianyl dithiolanyl including 1 3 dithiolanyl imidazolidinyl imidazolinyl morpholinyl 7 oxabicyclo 2.2.1 heptanyl 6 oxabicyclo 3.2.1 octanyl oxetanyl oxiranyl piperazinyl piperidinyl pyranyl pyrazolidinyl pyrrolidinonyl pyrrolidinyl pyrrolinyl quinuclidinyl sulfolanyl 3 sulfolenyl tetrahydropyranyl tetrahydrofuranyl tetrahydropyridyl such as 1 2 3 4 tetrahydropyridyl and 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridyl thietanyl thiiranyl thiolanyl thiomorpholinyl trithianyl including 1 3 5 trithianyl tropanyl and the like. Substituents on heterocycloalkyl groups may where appropriate be located on any atom in the ring system including a heteroatom. The point of attachment of heterocycloalkyl groups may be via any atom in the ring system including where appropriate a heteroatom such as a nitrogen atom or an atom on any fused carbocyclic ring that may be present as part of the ring system. Heterocycloalkyl groups may also be in the N or S oxidised form i.e. those heteroatoms may be substituted with one or two O substituents as appropriate . As stated herein other carbon atoms of the heterocycloalkyl groups mentioned herein may also be substituted by one or more O substituents. For the avoidance of doubt optional substituents may also be other cyclic groups which may be attached via a single carbon atom common to both rings so forming a spiro cycle .

The term heterocycloalkylene refers to a heterocycloalkyl group that is a part of a linker group. Each hyphen therefore represents the point of attachment to the moieties to which they are attached. For instance when Y represents heterocycloalkylene then the hyphens represent the point of attachment to X and Z . The point of attachment may be via any appropriate atom e.g. a nitrogen or carbon atom of that heterocycloalkyl moiety . Where it is indicated that such a moiety may be substituted the optional substituents are not an integral part of the macrocycle i.e. in the case where Y represents substituted heterocycloalkylene then those substituents are not directly linked to X or Z .

For the avoidance of doubt the term bicyclic e.g. when employed in the context of heterocycloalkyl groups refers to groups in which the second ring of a two ring system is formed between two adjacent atoms of the first ring. The term bridged e.g. when employed in the context of cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl groups refers to monocyclic or bicyclic groups in which two non adjacent atoms are linked by either an alkylene or heteroalkylene chain as appropriate .

Aryl groups that may be mentioned include Caryl groups. Such groups may be monocyclic bicyclic or tricyclic and have from 6 to 10 between 6 and 10 ring carbon atoms in which at least one ring is aromatic. Caryl groups include phenyl naphthyl and the like such as 1 2 3 4 tetrahydronaphthyl. The point of attachment of aryl groups may be via any atom of the ring system. However when aryl groups are bicyclic or tricyclic they are linked to the rest of the molecule via an aromatic ring. For the avoidance of doubt optional substituents include those defined herein and also include O substituents that may be attached to any non aromatic rings of a polycyclic e.g. bicyclic aryl group however in an embodiment O substituents are not included . For the avoidance of doubt optional substituents may also be other cyclic groups which may be when attached to a non aromatic ring of an aryl group attached via a single carbon atom common to both rings so forming a spiro cycle .

Unless otherwise specified the term heteroaryl when used herein refers to an aromatic group containing one or more heteroatom s e.g. one to four heteroatoms preferably selected from N O and S. Heteroaryl groups include those which have from 5 to 10 between 5 and 10 members and may be monocyclic bicyclic or tricyclic provided that at least one of the rings is aromatic so forming for example a mono bi or tricyclic heteroaromatic group . However when heteroaryl groups are bicyclic or tricyclic they are linked to the rest of the molecule via an aromatic ring. Heteroaryl groups that may be mentioned include acridinyl benzimidazolyl benzodioxanyl benzodioxepinyl benzodioxolyl including 1 3 benzodioxolyl benzofuranyl benzofurazanyl benzothiadiazolyl including 2 1 3 benzothiadiazolyl benzothiazolyl benzoxadiazolyl including 2 1 3 benzoxadiazolyl benzoxazinyl including 3 4 dihydro 2H 1 4 benzoxazinyl benzoxazolyl benzomorpholinyl benzoselena diazolyl including 2 1 3 benzoselenadiazolyl benzothienyl carbazolyl chromanyl cinnolinyl furanyl imidazolyl imidazo 1 2 a pyridyl indazolyl indolinyl indolyl isobenzofuranyl isochromanyl isoindolinyl isoindolyl isoquinolinyl isothiaziolyl isothiochromanyl isoxazolyl naphthyridinyl including 1 6 naphthyridinyl or preferably 1 5 naphthyridinyl and 1 8 naphthyridinyl oxadiazolyl including 1 2 3 oxadiazolyl 1 2 4 oxadiazolyl and 1 3 4 oxadiazolyl oxazolyl phenazinyl phenothiazinyl phthalazinyl pteridinyl purinyl pyranyl pyrazinyl pyrazolyl pyridazinyl pyridyl pyrimidinyl pyrrolyl quinazolinyl quinolinyl quinolizinyl quinoxalinyl tetrahydroisoquinolinyl including 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroisoquinolinyl and 5 6 7 8 tetrahydroisoquinolinyl tetrahydroquinolinyl including 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroquinolinyl and 5 6 7 8 tetrahydroquinolinyl tetrazolyl thiadiazolyl including 1 2 3 thiadiazolyl 1 2 4 thiadiazolyl and 1 3 4 thiadiazolyl thiazolyl thiochromanyl thiophenetyl thienyl triazolyl including 1 2 3 triazolyl 1 2 4 triazolyl and 1 3 4 triazolyl and the like. Substituents on heteroaryl groups may where appropriate be located on any atom in the ring system including a heteroatom. For the avoidance of doubt optional substituents include those defined herein and also include O substituents that may be attached to any non aromatic rings of a polycyclic e.g. bicyclic heteroaryl group but in an embodiment O substituents are not included . For the avoidance of doubt optional substituents may also be other cyclic groups which may be when attached to a non aromatic ring of a heteroaryl group attached via a single carbon atom common to both rings so forming a spiro cycle . The point of attachment of heteroaryl groups may be via any atom in the ring system including where appropriate a heteroatom such as a nitrogen atom or an atom on any fused carbocyclic ring that may be present as part of the ring system. Heteroaryl groups may also be in the N or S oxidised form.

The terms arylene and heteroarylene refer to aryl heteroaryl groups that are a part of a linker group. Each hyphen therefore represents the point of attachment to the moieties to which they are attached. For instance when Y represents arylene and heteroarylene then the hyphens represent the point of attachment to X and Z . The point of attachment may be via any appropriate atom e.g. a nitrogen or carbon atom of those moieties . Where it is indicated that those moieties may be substituted the optional substituents are not an integral part of the macrocycle i.e. in the case where Y represents substituted arylene or heteroarylene then those substituents are not directly linked to X or Z .

It may be specifically stated that the heteroaryl group is monocyclic or bicyclic. In the case where it is specified that the heteroaryl is bicyclic then it may consist of a five six or seven membered monocyclic ring e.g. a monocyclic heteroaryl ring fused with another a five six or seven membered ring e.g. a monocyclic aryl or heteroaryl ring .

Heteroatoms that may be mentioned include phosphorus silicon boron and preferably oxygen nitrogen and sulphur.

Linker groups for example as defined by X and Z are specified with hyphens s at the respective ends depicting the points of attachment with the rest of the compound of formula I. For the avoidance of doubt in relation to the linker groups defined by Z the first hyphen of the linking moiety is the point at which that moiety links to the requisite phenyl ring bearing Rand Rgroups and the last hyphen depicts the linking point to the Y group. Similarly for the X linker group the first hyphen represents the point of attachment to the Y group and the last hyphen represents the point of attachment to ring A B.

For the avoidance of doubt in cases in which the identity of two or more substituents in a compound of the invention may be the same the actual identities of the respective substituents are not in any way interdependent. For example in the situation in which there is more than one Qsubstituent present then those Qsubstituents may be the same or different. Further in the case where there are two Qsubstituents present in which one represents ORand the other represents C O R then those Rgroups are not to be regarded as being interdependent.

For the avoidance of doubt in the instance where cyclic substituents e.g. cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl groups are present on groups such as alkyl groups then those cyclic substituents may be attached to the same carbon atom so forming for example a spiro cyclic group.

All individual features e.g. preferred features mentioned herein may be taken in isolation or in combination with any other feature including preferred feature mentioned herein hence preferred features may be taken in conjunction with other preferred features or independently of them .

The skilled person will appreciate that compounds of the invention that are the subject of this invention include those that are stable. That is compounds of the invention include those that are sufficiently robust to survive isolation from e.g. a reaction mixture to a useful degree of purity.

For instance it is indicated herein that Amay represent various integers. However certain integers may not be linked together if unstable groups are formed e.g. O may not be linked to S etc. The skilled person will appreciate the combinations that are possible in order for the group to be sufficiently stable and or for the rules of valency to be adhered to.

For the avoidance of doubt when a term such as Eto E is employed herein this will be understood by the skilled person to mean E E Eand E inclusively. Likewise a term such as Rto R when employed herein will be understood by the skilled person to mean every single Rto Rgroup i.e. R R R R R R R R R R R R and R inclusively.

The use of protecting groups is fully described in 3edition T. W. Greene P. G. M. Wutz Wiley Interscience 1999 .

Compounds of the invention are indicated as pharmaceuticals. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention for use as a pharmaceutical.

For the avoidance of doubt although compounds of the invention may possess pharmacological activity as such certain pharmaceutically acceptable e.g. protected derivatives of compounds of the invention may exist or be prepared which may not possess such activity but may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention. Such compounds which may possess some pharmacological activity provided that such activity is appreciably lower than that of the active compounds to which they are metabolised may therefore be described as prodrugs of compounds of the invention.

A prodrug of a compound of the invention is as hereinbefore defined including compounds that form a compound of the invention in an experimentally detectable amount within a predetermined time e.g. about 1 hour following oral or parenteral administration. All prodrugs of the compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention.

Furthermore certain compounds of the invention may possess no or minimal pharmacological activity as such but may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention that possess pharmacological activity as such. Such compounds which also includes compounds that may possess some pharmacological activity but that activity is appreciably lower than that of the active compounds of the invention to which they are metabolised may also be described as prodrugs .

Thus the compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity and or are metabolised in the body following oral or parenteral administration to form compounds which possess pharmacological activity.

Compounds of the invention may inhibit protein or lipid kinases such as a PI3 kinase especially a class I PI3K or a PIM family kinase e.g. PIM 1 PIM 2 and or PIM 3 for example as may be shown in the tests described below for example the test for PI3K and PIM inhibition described below and or in tests known to the skilled person.

Hence certain compounds of the invention may be dual e.g. PI3K and mTOR PI3K and PIM or mTOR and PIM inhibitors. Further certain compounds of the invention may be triple e.g. PI3K PIM and mTOR inhibitors.

The term inhibit may refer to any measurable reduction and or prevention of catalytic kinase e.g. PI3K particularly class I PI3K mTOR and or PIM activity. The reduction and or prevention of kinase activity may be measured by comparing the kinase activity in a sample containing a compound of the invention and an equivalent sample of kinase e.g. PI3K particularly class I PI3K mTOR and or PIM in the absence of a compound of the invention as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. The measurable change may be objective e.g. measurable by some test or marker for example in an in vitro or in vivo assay or test such as one described hereinafter or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to those skilled in the art or subjective e.g. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect .

Compounds of the invention may be found to exhibit 50 inhibition of a protein or lipid kinase e.g. PI3K such as class I PI3K mTOR and or PIM at a concentration of 100 M or below for example at a concentration of below 50 M or even below 10 M such as below 1 M when tested in an assay or other test for example as described hereinafter or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to the skilled person.

Compounds of the invention are thus expected to be useful in the treatment of a disorder in which a protein or lipid kinase e.g. PI3K such as class I PI3K mTOR and or PIM is known to play a role and which are characterised by or associated with an overall elevated activity of that kinase due to for example increased amount of the kinase or increased catalytic activity of the kinase . Hence compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of a disease disorder arising from abnormal cell growth function or behaviour associated with the protein or lipid kinase e.g. PI3K such as class I PI3K mTOR and or PIM . Such conditions disorders include cancer immune disorders cardiovascular diseases viral infections inflammation metabolism endocrine function disorders and neurological disorders.

By bringing into association we mean that the two components are rendered suitable for administration in conjunction with each other.

Thus in relation to the process for the preparation of a kit of parts as hereinbefore defined by bringing the two components into association with each other we include that the two components of the kit of parts may be 

 i provided as separate formulations i.e. independently of one another which are subsequently brought together for use in conjunction with each other in combination therapy or

 ii packaged and presented together as separate components of a combination pack for use in conjunction with each other in combination therapy.

Depending on the disorder and the patient to be treated as well as the route of administration compounds of the invention may be administered at varying therapeutically effective doses to a patient in need thereof. However the dose administered to a mammal particularly a human in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic response in the mammal over a reasonable timeframe. One skilled in the art will recognize that the selection of the exact dose and composition and the most appropriate delivery regimen will also be influenced by inter alia the pharmacological properties of the formulation the nature and severity of the condition being treated and the physical condition and mental acuity of the recipient as well as the potency of the specific compound the age condition body weight sex and response of the patient to be treated and the stage severity of the disease.

Administration may be continuous or intermittent e.g. by bolus injection . The dosage may also be determined by the timing and frequency of administration. In the case of oral or parenteral administration the dosage can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of the invention.

In any event the medical practitioner or other skilled person will be able to determine routinely the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient. The above mentioned dosages are exemplary of the average case there can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.

Compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are effective inhibitors of protein or lipid kinases e.g. PI3K such as class I PI3K mTOR and or PIM . In an embodiment compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are both PI3K e.g. class I PI3K such as PI3K inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors i.e. they may exhibit dual kinase inhibition. In a further embodiment compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are PIM inhibitors and are also either PI3K e.g. class I PI3K such as PI3K inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors i.e. they may exhibit dual kinase inhibition. In a yet further embodiment compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are PI3K e.g. class I PI3K such as PI3K inhibitors mTOR inhibitors and PIM inhibitors i.e. they may exhibit triple kinase inhibition.

Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be more efficacious than be less toxic than be longer acting than be more potent than produce fewer side effects than be more easily absorbed than and or have a better pharmacokinetic profile e.g. higher oral bioavailability and or lower clearance than and or have other useful pharmacological physical or chemical properties over compounds known in the prior art whether for use in the above stated indications or otherwise.

Pharmacokinetic data for a selection of the compounds of the invention are shown in Table 4. These data demonstrate that the macrocyclic compounds are stable under physiological conditions. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the activity that is observed for the compounds of the invention is associated with the compounds in their macrocyclic forms as opposed to in ring open forms.

As stated hereinbefore compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they may exhibit triple e.g. dual kinase inhibitory activity e.g. may act as inhibitors of combinations of PI3K such PI3K mTOR and PIM e.g. PI3K such PI3K and mTOR . In this respect advantageously compounds of the invention may be considered as multi targeted kinase inhibitors. Compounds of the invention that exhibit single selectivity for a kinase may have the additional benefit that they exhibit less side effects whereas compounds of the invention that exhibit multiple kinase selectivity may have the additional benefit that they exhibit better potency and or efficacy.

To date clinical development of PI3K and dual PI3K mTOR inhibitors have shown moderate activities suggesting that either more potent efficacious inhibitors are required or that inhibition of multiple targets or even pathways might be required for effective treatments see e.g. Bunney Tom D. Katan Matilda Phosphoinositide signalling in cancer beyond PI3K and PTEN Nature Reviews Cancer 2010 10 5 342 352 Cleary James M. and Shapiro Geoffrey I. Development of phosphoinositide 3 kinase pathway inhibitors for advanced cancer Current Oncology Report 2010 12 87 94 and van der Heijden Michiel S and Bernards Ren Inhibition of the PI3K Pathway Hope We Can Believe in Clinical Cancer Research 2010 16 3094 3099 .

Advantageously the compounds of the invention may have the benefit that they inhibit multiple targets or even multiple pathways . For instance in addition to being inhibitors of PI3K mTOR and PIM e.g. PI3K e.g PI3K and mTOR they may also be effective inhibitors of other protein or lipid kinases as may be demonstrated by known tests . In this respect compounds of the invention may be considered to have an improved kinase inhibition cross reactivity profile e.g. by being selective against multiple kinases of therapeutic interest for instance compared to compounds known in the prior art. They may have advantages in the clinic.

Compounds of the invention may combine dual PI3K mTOR activity optionally together with PIM activity with activity on other key kinases indeed combination products covering this spectrum of kinases are currently being evaluated as mentioned above thereby allowing single agent administration or potentially combination products with reduced dosages and providing the associated benefits e.g. reducing the risk of drug drug interactions etc.

Compounds of the invention may be beneficial as they are medicaments with targeted therapy i.e. which target a particular molecular entity by inferring or inhibiting it e.g. in this case by inhibiting one or more protein or lipid kinases as hereinbefore described . Compounds of the invention may therefore also have the benefit that they have a new effect for instance as compared to known compounds in the prior art for instance the new effect may be a particular mode of action or another effect resultant of the targeted therapy. Targeted therapies may be beneficial as they may have the desired effect e.g. reduce cancer by reducing tumor growth or carcinogenisis but may also have the advantage of reducing side effects e.g. by preventing the killing of normal cells as may occur using e.g. chemotherapy .

Furthermore compounds of the invention may selectively target particular protein or lipid kinases e.g. the ones described herein compared to other known protein or lipid kinases. Accordingly compounds of the invention may have the advantage that certain specific cancers may be treated selectively which selective treatment may also have the effect of reducing side effects.

Determination of PI3 and PIM kinase activity of compounds of the invention such as those exemplified is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described herein were prepared characterized and assayed for their PI3K PIM and mTOR enzymatic activities using the methods described herein. The compounds may also be tested in cell based assays.

The kinase activity was measured by using the commercial ADP Hunter Plus assay available from DiscoveR 33 016 which is a homogeneous assay to measure the accumulation of ADP a universal product of kinase activity. The enzyme PI3K p110 p85 was purchased from Cama Biosciences 07CBS 0402A . The assay was done following the manufacturer recommendations with slight modifications Mainly the kinase buffer was replace by 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 3 mM MgCl 100 mM NaCl 1 mM EGTA 0.04 CHAPS 2 mM TCEP and 0.01 mg ml BGG. The PI3K was assayed in a titration experiment to determine the optimal protein concentration for the inhibition assay. To calculate the ICof the ETP compounds serial 1 5 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration 2.5 g ml . The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 30 M PIPsubstrate P9763 Sigma for 5 min and then ATP was added to a final 50 M concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 25 C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Fluorescence counts were read in a Victor instrument Perkin Elmer with the recommended settings 544 and 580 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths respectively . Values were normalized against the control activity included for each enzyme i.e. 100 PI3 kinase activity without compound . These values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration and were fit to a sigmoid dose response curve by using the Graphad software.

The enzymatic mTOR activity was measured using a LanthaScreen kinase activity assay Invitrogen . The enzyme was purchased from Invitrogen PV4754 as well as the GFP labeled substrate 4EBP1 GFP PV4759 and the Tb anti p4EBP1 pThr46 antibody PV4757 . The assay was performed in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5 containing 1.5 mM MnCl 10 mM MgCl 1 mM EGTA 2.5 mM DTT and 0.01 Tween 20. The concentration of the assay components were the following 0.24 nM mTOR kinase 400 nM 4EBP1 GFP 10 mM ATP and serial dilutions of the compound inhibitor to be evaluated. After 1 h incubation at room temperature 20 mM EDTA was used to stop the reaction and terbium labeled antibody 4 nM added to detect phosphorylated product. The antibody associates with the phosphorylated product resulting in an increased TR FRET value. The TR FRET value a dimensionless number was calculated as the ratio of the acceptor signal GFP emission at 520 nm to the donor signal terbium emission at 495 nm . Values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration and fitted to a sigmoid dose response curve using GraphPad software.

The biochemical assay to measure PIM 1 activity relies on the ADP Hunter assay kit DiscoveRx Corp. Cat. 90 0077 that determines the amount of ADP as direct product of the kinase enzyme activity.

The enzyme has been expressed and purified in house as a recombinant human protein with a C terminal histidine tag. The protein is active and stable.

Assay conditions were as indicated by the kit manufacturers with the following adaptations for the kinase activity step 

Assays were performed in either 96 or 384 well plates. The final outcome of the coupled reactions provided by the kit is the release of the fluorescent product Resorufin and has been measured with a multilabel HTS counter VICTOR V PerkinElmer using an excitation filter at 544 nm and an emission filter at 580 nm.

Experiments were done using BALB c female mice 10 weeks old. Compounds were dissolved in selected vehicles at a concentration calculated in order to administer the dose selected in 0.1 mL. Animals were administered by i.v and oral route by gavage and sacrificed at different time points n 3 at each time point . Time points were 0.08 0.25 0.5 1 4 and 8 h for the i.v branch and 0.08 0.16 0.25 0.5 1 4 8 and 24 h for oral branch. Blood was collected and processed for plasma which was analyzed and quantified by means of tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data to a compartmental model using Winnonlin software for pharmacokinetic analysis.

Cell viability in the presence of test compounds is measured by the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay commercially available from Promega Corp. Madison Wis. This homogeneous assay method is based on the recombinant expression of Coleoptera luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 5 583 024 U.S. Pat. No. 5 674 713 U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 670 and determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells Crouch et al 1993 J. Immunol. Meth. 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677 . The CellTiterGlo Assay was conducted in 96 making it amenable to automated highthroughput screening HTS Cree et al 1995 AntiCancer Drugs 6 398 404 .

The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cells cultured in serum supplemented medium. Cell washing removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells well in a 96 well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.

The homogeneous add mix measure format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter Glo Assay generates a glow type luminescent signal produced by the luciferase reaction which has a half life generally greater than five hours depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units RLU . The substrate Beetle Luciferin is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell proliferation assay can be used with various multiwell formats e.g. 96 or 384 well format. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as relative light units RLU measured over time.

Activity is measured as endogenous levels of phospho Akt1 Ser473 protein. Osteosarcoma U20S cells are plated in 96 Poly D Lysine coating tissue culture plates 18.000 cells well . After the treatment with serial dilutions of the compound during 3 h the cells are fixed directly in the wells with 4 paraformaldehyde.

After fixing individual wells go through the same series of steps used for a conventional immunoblot including blocking with 5 BSA incubation with 1 1000 of primary antibody AKT Ser 74 in PBS containing 5 BSA at 4 C. overnight Cell Signalling washing and incubation with second antibody HRP anti mouse IgG for 1 h at RT Amersham . After the addition of SuperSignal ELISA Femto maximum sensitivity chemiluminescent substrate Pierce the results are read using a luminescence plate reader Victor .
