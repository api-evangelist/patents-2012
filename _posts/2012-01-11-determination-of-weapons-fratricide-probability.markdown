title: Determination of weapons fratricide probability
abstract: A computer-implemented method is provided for determining fratricide probability of projectile collision from a projectile launcher on a platform and an interception hazard that can be ejected or launched from a deployment position. The platform can represent a combat vessel, with the projectile launcher being a gun, the interception hazard being a missile, and the deployment position being a vertical launch cell. The projectile launcher operates within an angular area called the firing zone of the platform. The method includes determining the firing zone, calculating an angular firing area, quantifying a frontal area of the interception hazard, translating the resulting frontal area across a flight trajectory, sweeping the projectile launcher to produce a slew angle, combining the slew and trajectory, and dividing the combined interception area by the firing area. The firing and interception areas are calculated using spherical projection.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to ordnance fratricide probabilities. In particular techniques are presented to enable systematic and comparative fratricidal interceptions from concurrently conflicting weapons systems.

Weapon fratricide represents a long standing safety concern for weapon systems. Fratricide is defined as an attack on friendly forces by other friendly forces. Calculating the probability of fratricide has proven to be technically challenging. Manual resources devoted to these efforts yield limited results due to their time consuming nature and the simplifying assumptions necessary to render the mathematical calculations tractable on a reasonable scale. U.S. Pat. No. 3 616 456 to Mindel and U.S. Pat. No. 4 164 165 to Bean et al. represent prior art examples of prior art mitigation techniques that provide firing zone lockout mechanisms.

Conventional fratricide probability techniques yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular conventional systems introduce errors that expand exponentially with increasing field coverage. Additionally the absence of systematic characterization of the gun restriction firing zone and ordnance that present interception hazards render manual calculations tedious and time consuming.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a computer implemented method for determining fratricide probability of projectile collision from a projectile launcher on a platform and an interception hazard that can be ejected or launched from a deployment position. The platform can represent a combat vessel with the projectile launcher being a gun the interception hazard being a missile and the deployment position being a vertical launch cell. The projectile launcher operates within an angular area called the firing zone of the platform.

The method includes determining the firing zone calculating an angular firing area quantifying a frontal area of the interception hazard translating the resulting frontal area across a flight trajectory sweeping the projectile launcher to produce a slew angle combining the slew and trajectory and dividing the combined interception area by the firing area. The fire and interception areas are calculated using spherical projection.

Various exemplary embodiments calculate the angular firing zone by an integral for a rectangular solid angle as cos d d where and are azimuth bounds and and are elevation of the firing zone. Calculating the interception hazard includes discretizing a perspective view of the interception hazard into discrete spatial points evaluating those points as a contiguous group of triangular plates and summing all of the triangular solid angles to produce the frontal area.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention the components process steps and or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems computing platforms computer programs and or general purpose machines. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature such as hardwired devices or the like may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or a floating point gate array FPGA or other related component.

Various exemplary embodiments describe the development of techniques for calculating fratricide probabilities between a gun projectile and other ship fired ordnance. These embodiments provide flexibility to analyze any combination of ship layout gun and surface launched ordnance system such as missiles fired from deck installed launcher cells within a vertical launch system VLS . Various collected data are mathematically manipulated to calculate the probability of fratricide using solid angle geometry. These calculations account for ordnance fly out paths as well as gun slewing action. This development aids and improves accurate prediction of fratricide potential of a weapon system safety engineer between various shipboard weapons systems and to thereby quantify the risk of personnel injury and equipment damage.

In the context of this disclosure fratricide involves intersection of ordnance on one s own ship ownship ordnance with other ownship ordnance. Collision of such ordnance can cause an energetic reaction leading to catastrophic damage and or death. One such tragic example occurred on Jul. 29 1967 aboard the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal CV 59 in which an accidentally launched Zuni rocket struck a bomb laden A 4 Skyhawk causing a conflagration that cost 134 lives many of whom from thermal cook off of exposed munitions. This analysis procedure aids in the determination of the probability of such an incident to advise proper authorities of the level of risk associated with this hazard and institute appropriate mitigation measures.

Conventionally fratricide analysis is performed manually. Various exemplary embodiments describe development and utilization of an automated Fratricide Probability Calculator FPC which more precisely calculates fratricide probabilities for user defined ship classes and layouts as well as various gun weapon systems i.e. projectile launcher and missile launching systems e.g. potential interception hazard .

Conventional analytical efforts have incorporated cylindrical modeling to calculate the probability. Preferably spherical modeling can provide more accurate results by taking into consideration the various fly out paths as well as various stewing actions of the gun. The FPC can employ this spherical modeling along with other enhancements to provide an automated capability to provide quick and accurate probabilities of fratricide for a myriad of weapon systems combinations.

The calculation of fratricide probability can be analogized as a ratio of the total amount of area being presented by a target relative to the total area available in which the gun can fire. A blindfolded person randomly throwing darts at a dart board on a wall represents a hypothetical example. Assuming that the person can only strike within the boundaries of the wall for a dart board that represents one tenth the presented area of the wall the chances that the person hits the board is ten percent 10 . The calculation of fratricide probability introduces greater complexity than the simple random dart throwing analogy assumes particularly for combat vessels e.g. naval ships with intricate restrictions depending on positions of superstructure components antenna masts etc.

First Step The model determines the gun firing zones for a warship or other combat vessel from the gun mount view over a missile system that contains a plurality of missiles. The gun firing zone is defined as the region within which the gun can fire without striking any portion of the ship. Irrespective of type or class each ship possesses a unique layout and therefore different firing zones from other ships. The gun firing zones are defined in terms of their azimuth and elevation boundaries. For the example described herein the entire gun firing zone can be divided into separate sectors depending on the minimum elevation angles.

Second Step The model identifies which sector to which each missile corresponds. Aegis equipped warships house vertically containerized missiles launched from cells. described subsequently illustrate the missile positions as located within the second through fourth sectors of the five shown. If a missile cell overlaps two sectors the cell can be selected as corresponding to the sector which contained half or more of the cell area for calculation purposes.

Third Step The model calculates the distance R between the center of each missile cell and the gun. This determination can be performed using the Pythagorean Theorem using orthogonal rectangular co rdinates.

Fourth Step The model calculates the field of fire area Aabove each missile cell using cylindrical geometry. Spherical geometry techniques are discussed subsequently.

For a cylindrical geometry as an example eqn. 1 can be used as a function of distance R. The parameters to be determined include the firing azimuth arc and the height Hof the field of fire above the missile cells. The azimuth arc in eqn. 2 is based on azimuth boundary difference from port to starboard swing of the gun mount. The firing height Hin eqn. 3 is based on the relative angular difference between elevation and depression bounds. These equations are provided below 

Fifth Step The model calculates the exposed missile height Hin the field of fire over each missile cell. For vertical length values of the missile exceeding the firing height of eqn. 3 the exposed missile height His assigned to equal the field of fire height Hover the missile cell. Otherwise the exposed missile height Hequals the vertical length of the missile.

Sixth Step The model calculates the probability of fratricide for each missile cell. The missile area Acan be calculated based on the exposed missile height Hand the width of the missile Win eqn. 4 . The fratricide probability Pcan then be calculated based on the missile area Aand the total field of fire area Ain eqn. 5 . The equations are shown below 

Seventh Step The model extends these calculations to determine the maximum and average of all the missile probabilities for the entire missile system. This involves determining the overlapping regions between gun slew and missile firings over the entire combat vessel.

Firing zones for an exemplary combat vessel can be visualized along an elevation view such towards the bow and a plan view from above in respectively. illustrates a gun perspective panorama with abscissa and ordinate demarcating angular degrees. The abscissa represents azimuth from the longitudinal ship axis with port extending positively from 0 and starboard extending negatively from 360 . The ordinate represents elevation from 30 depression to 90 vertical . A ship horizon outline from the gun s perspective demarcates definitive regions. The region below the outline denotes a restrictive cutout area whereas the region above the outline denotes a firing area .

Missile cells are disposed within the restrictive area . An example missile profile features a Standard Missile 2 adjacent to the cells which represent the Vertical Launcher System VLS that houses these missiles before launch. The example surface to air missile in profile represents an interception hazard against which probability of collision may be calculated.

A firing zone denotes portions of the angular window through which the gun may aim. This zone may be subdivided into substantially rectangular sectors and as plotted along the azimuth quantifying abscissa and the elevation quantifying ordinate . The firing zone or its individual sectors may be quantified by an azimuth and by an elevation .

Cylindrical Modeling Limitations Although cylindrical modeling can be appropriate for an exemplary analysis this geometry introduces error as elevation increases. This effect can be observed in from the perspective view shown. Three dimensional orthogonal axes are illustrated in the axial X direction the vertical Y direction and the lateral Z direction with a center position as the origin. A cylinder and a sphere extend about the center as origin. Spherical and cylindrical projections radiate from the origin visibly displaying respectively a cylindrical four cornered region and a spherical four cornered region . As the elevation or latitude increases i.e. diverges from 0 the cylindrical region distorts further in relation to the spherical region .

As observable in the graph the distortion error in area reaches one hundred percent 100 at an elevation of 60 . In contrast the same image projected on a sphere is not distorted. In conventional analysis gun elevation is assumed to be limited thereby consigning the distortion errors to be negligible. However future analyses are expected to involve greater ranges in azimuth necessitating reduction or elimination of this error source which can be accomplished with spherical modeling. Such an adjustment corrects distortion in the firing height Hthat increases asymptotically.

Spherical Modeling Method The FPC provides a tool that can quickly and accurately calculate the probability of fratricide between a gun and another weapon system. This tool enables automation of the process to be executable on a standard desktop computer thereby enabling analysis of any combination of ship type layout gun and ship launched ordnance system while considering the three dimensional relationship between the gun and other ordnance.

Analysis efforts focus on ship launched missiles due to the criticality and detrimental effects of the fratricide mishap. However ordnance also includes ship self defense weapons and gun projectiles. In special cases a gun barrel may also be modeled as the ordnance to be examined. Consideration can be given to the vulnerability of the ordnance as well as the total elapsed time in which the missile is within the field of view of the gun.

For the purpose of alterations and reproducibility the operator is assumed to be able to create and save a database of ordnance gun ship types and layouts as well as missile motion parameters and gun firing scenarios. Additional fidelity in the predictions can be gained through the use of Monte Carlo scenarios in which combinations of variables could be modified with respect to one another.

Parameter Inputs The main inputs are the gun firing zones gun firing parameters physical dimensions of the ordnance and ordnance flyout parameters including trajectory. The gun firing zones are defined in terms of their azimuth and elevation boundaries as depicted in and can be easily stored and retrieved in tabular form such as a spreadsheet file.

The gun firing parameters are defined by the path along which the gun is trained and the duration of time the gun fires a round. For simplicity the path can be defined as a straight line between starting and ending co rdinates azimuth and elevation . The duration can be defined as either a period of time or a single shot. For simplicity in these examples the passage of the ordnance between two rounds can be neglected.

A collision occurs if the gun points at the ordnance at any time while firing. The physical dimensions of the ordnance may be loaded into the program via a Computer Aided Drafting CAD file while the ordnance s flyout parameters can be modeled as a series of orthogonal co rdinates related to the position of the ordnance over a series of time steps. Additional accuracy can be added by incorporating gun firing probability zones and ordnance vulnerability maps into the calculation.

Description of Mathematical Method One significant difference between cylindrical and spherical modeling involves the absence of a physical surface to yield an area of the gun firing zone against which to compare to the target s area facing the gun. The target as described herein represents a fratricide hazard although these principles can be extended to intended interception scenarios.

Therefore a sounder approach compares the angular area of the target to that of the firing zone presented to the gun. Angular areas called solid angles are measured in steradians in the same manner that standard angles can be measured in radians. The solid angle of a sphere equals 4 steradians. The calculation of angular areas includes two different geometries rectangular and triangular solid angles. These solid angles represent geometric boundaries for gun fire exclusion.

The first pair of azimuth lines provides lesser and greater longitudinal boundaries . The second pair of elevation lines produces lower and higher latitude boundaries . These curved boundaries and produce a rectangular solid area or shadow denoted as that maps onto the sphere . The rectangular solid angle can be calculated from the azimuth and elevation boundaries corresponding to the integral solution of eqn. 6 

In the X Y plane a first vertical line extends from the intersection of horizontal lines in the Y direction reaching to point a. Correspondingly a first radial line extends from the origin to point a. Similarly second vertical and radial lines respectively extend in the Y and radial directions to point b with third vertical and radial lines also extending in like manner to point c.

The radial lines extending from the origin intersect through the surface of the sphere to bound a triangular solid angle or shadow labeled . These radial lines extend to points a b and c to form a flat Cartesian triangle beyond the sphere . Calculating the triangular solid angles involves the magnitudes of the three points of the triangle in three dimensional orthogonal space e.g. Cartesian polar etc. . This can be expressed as eqn. 7 

Because the gun firing zone in is defined as a series of azimuth and elevation bounds the total angular area of the zone equals the sum of rectangular solid angles dictated by these bounds represented by the sections through . The ordnance s dimensions and location can be mathematically defined as a series of points in space similar to points a b c in which are easier to determine than azimuth and elevation bounds.

Consequently the techniques described herein prefer the triangular method to solve for the solid angle of the ordnance. This can be accomplished by dividing the ordnance into a series of triangles in space known as meshing in finite element modeling and then adding the solid angles of each individual triangle for a combined profile such as by by summation.

As mentioned previously the resultant fratricide probability Pequals the ratio of solid angles between the ordnance and firing zone as expressed in eqn. 8 

For a single shot from the gun the fratricide probability can be readily determined. However determining a fratricide probability solution becomes more complicated for either when a gun is slewing or is firing over an extended time interval because the relative motion between the gun and the ordnance must be accounted for. Either example may represent a high speed missile intercept and or avoidance scenario. In the case of ordnance motion a solid angle shadow extending over the entire firing duration can be modeled.

A collision interception of the ordnance occurs in consequence to a gun firing continuously at any single point in its firing zone with the ordnance traveling through the gun firing line. Continuous firing in this context means that intervals yield distances between bullets or other gun launched projectile is smaller than the missile s smallest dimension.

Intersection of the sphere by the boundary lines projects a smaller solid area representing a region labeled . The fratricide probability Pof eqn. 8 can be revised accordingly by substituting the trajectory solid angle for the original ordnance solid angle in the numerator.

For a slewing gun the ordnance is likewise in relative motion to the gun s aim point corresponding to the spatial origin . This motion creates a distortion of the ordnance s shadow as solid angle on the sphere . While the gun motion creates a greater solid angle for the ordnance the solid angle of the firing zone labeled remains unchanged. The solid angle of the firing zone projection is based on the ship outline whereas the solid angle of the ordnance and or its path is measured relative to the gun aim vantage .

The model follows by determining the solid angle of the combined path and sweep and proceeds with probability calculation of fratricide for each launch cell. The model concludes by repeating these procedures for final determination of maximum and average probabilities are determined for the entire system.

First Step The model determines the gun firing zones for a ship from the gun mount view over the missile system. The gun firing zones are defined in terms of their azimuth and elevation boundaries thereby enabling their boundaries as shown in to be calculated. The azimuth and the cosine of the elevation are double integrated between their limits using the rectangular area formula in eqn. 6 to determine their respective solid angles as .

Second Step The model discretizes the elevation view frontal profile of the missile such as into triangular plates as determined by eqn. 7 . The boundaries of these plates can be represented as shown in by discrete points that represent the missile projected from the gun s position .

Third Step The model calculates the missile s trajectory path from its launch cell. This can be accomplished by translating the discrete points representing the missile across its trajectory flight path to produce a solid angle for the ordnance path mapped onto the sphere .

Fourth Step The model calculates the angular sweep of the gun s slew. This can be accomplished by mapping the gun slewing sweep swept from the center onto the sphere .

Fifth Step The model determines the solid angle of the combined path and sweep. The mapped area in illustrates an exemplary solid angle formed by the combined missile path and gun slew. This can be accomplished by translating the discrete points representing the ordnance path from the third step across the sweep of the slewing gun in the fourth step to determine the boundary limit points within the firing zone area that define the region in which the gun can fire into the missile s trajectory.

Sixth Step The model calculates the probability of fratricide for each of the missile cells using eqn. 8 with representing the path and slew solid angle of the fifth step and representing the solid area of the gun firing zone of the second step . Alternatively for circumstances neglecting gun slew eqn. 8 can employ as representing only the ordnance path solid angle of the third step .

Seventh Step The model extends these calculations to determine the maximum and average of all the missile probabilities for the entire missile system. This involves determining the overlapping regions between gun slew and missile firings over the entire combat vessel.

Additional precision of the fratricide probability may be achieved by including gun fire probability zones into the calculation. These are simply areas of the gun firing zone in which the probability of firing may vary. Such an example would be a gun that fires seven five percent 75 of the time between 5 and 10 elevation and the remainder above this region within the firing zone .

This capability incorporates into the fratricide probability calculation weighting factors to the solid angle depending on the corresponding probability zone. shows a perspective view of a missile passing through three dimensional space. The projected firing zone solid area is shown sub divided into a lower zone portion and an upper zone portion . Within each lower and upper portion the gun respectively fires 75 and 25 of the total operational time.

These techniques may also be applied to ordnance vulnerability in the same manner as for determining gun fire probability zones increase precision. A round penetrating the warhead significantly increases the chance for fratricide whereas hitting a fin or another inert component may not. shows an ordnance model that can be included to feature an ordnance vulnerability map. Similar to the gun fire probability ordnance vulnerability calculated by the ordnance designers can be included in the fratricide probability calculation by adding and subtracting weighting factors to the solid angle.

Further accuracy can be added by running Monte Carlo scenarios. The technique enables comparative analysis of multiple firing times slewing paths and ordnance flyout courses against one another. The resultant fratricide probabilities can then be averaged together to achieve a more confident result.

Development of the Fratricide Probability Calculator adds significant capability in determining the fratricide probability between two shipboard weapon systems. Inclusion of spherical modeling of the ship environment leads to a better representation of the relationship between the gun and the ordnance. The technique facilitates a mathematical determination of the effects of a complicated ordnance fly out path and slewing gun on the fratricide probability. Thus these techniques generate higher fidelity probabilities and expand the variables that can be analyzed.

The process initiates a cell iteration loop beginning at with index j 1 and proceeding to obtain the jcell location at . The process proceeds to vector calculation from the gun to that cell. The process initiates a trajectory iteration loop beginning at with index k 1 and proceeding to creation a random launch vector centered about the center vector within a half cone angle to produce the launch vector . The process proceeds to launch calculation of the location where the launch vector intersects the cutout planes to produce a plane intersection and used to determine trajectory starting position . The process continues along several paths from total cutout to continuation x from launch calculation to continuation y from starting position to continuation z . Similarly nested loops and continue as respective third second and first continuations and .

The process uses the number of trajectories as a query to determine whether the trajectory index exceeds that value. A negative response returns the process to the trajectory iteration loop via the third continuation . An affirmative response causes the process to increment the cell index by j 1 as . The process uses the number of cells as a query to determine whether the cell index exceeds that value. A negative response returns the process to the cell iteration loop via the second continuation . An affirmative response causes the process to increment the launcher index by i 1 as . The process uses the number of launchers as a query to determine whether the launcher index exceeds that value. A negative response returns the process to the launcher iteration loop via the first continuation . An affirmative response causes the process for calculation of the mean fratricide probability for each cell based on the trigonometric relation in eqn. 7 and then proceeds to calculation of mean overall fratricide probability in eqn. 8 .

These provide exemplary high level program instructions for implementing select portions of exemplary embodiments of the invention to assist artisans of ordinary skill in their practice. Nonetheless these examples are provided for illustrations only and are not limiting with respect to their particular formulation.

A visual example of the respective fratricidal paths can be observed in . shows a perspective representational view of a ship platform. The ship s geometric origin is designated by a reference location from which can be defined horizontal directions for bow stern port and starboard as well as vertical direction for elevation . Positions are provided for a gun location analogous to the central position in such as for the Phalanx Mk 15 close in weapon system CIWS as well cell locations corresponding to missile cells in as for vertical launch missiles such as RGM 84 Harpoon.

The CIWS can be restricted by cutout boundaries based on the ship s profile from the perspective of the gun location . However because the missiles can traverse regions beyond the cutout boundaries in their flyout trajectories denoted by a dash ring fratricide probability determination can mitigate risk of damage to the missile and corresponding damage to the ship through such an event from the CIWS. The fratricide probability determination technique enables fire control officers or an automated system to select a threshold probability above which would inhibit the CIWS from operation until being updated or until being reset.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
