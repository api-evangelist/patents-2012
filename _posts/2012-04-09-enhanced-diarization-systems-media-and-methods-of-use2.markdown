Embodiments of the disclosure relate to methods and systems for diarization of call data for use with a fraud detection system. The enhanced diarization technologies provided herein may be utilized to identify unique individuals speaking within a single audio data file by determining characteristics of the call audio data and applying rules to the call audio data that are based upon business logic of an enterprise. The separated audio can then more efficiently be used to identify an individual.

Often fraudsters perpetrate fraudulent actions against an enterprise via a telephonic interaction with the enterprise. Fraud detection systems may process the telephonic interaction as a single audio source comprising multiple speakers. Separating the speakers can be difficult.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form only in order to avoid obscuring the disclosure.

Broadly speaking the present technology may be directed to the diarization of call audio data and for the use of diarized call audio data within fraud detection systems and processes. Generally fraudsters may perpetrate fraudulent actions against an enterprise via telephonic interaction with the enterprise. Often times fraudsters may attempt to gain control of a legitimate customer account or may attempt to establish a new account that can be used as a means for perpetrating fraudulent activities.

When attempting to gain control of a legitimate account the fraudster may contact the enterprise telephonically and engage with a customer service agent or any other agent to modify the account in such a way that the fraudster may use the account for fraudulent purposes. For example the fraudster may attempt to change the billing address associated with the account to ensure that products are redirected to an address used by the fraudster. Other types of fraudulent activities may be more subtle in their execution and manner of detection.

As background each time or according to established business rules for the enterprise an inbound or outbound telephone call occurs with an enterprise the telephone call may be recorded and data associated with the telephone call may be memorialized in the customer account record by the customer agent facilitating the telephone call. A call data event may be understood to include both the call audio data associated with a telephone call as well as the call non audio data that is determined from the call. Exemplary non audio data may include but is not limited to an automatic number identification ANI caller identification information an international mobile equipment identity number a given name the timestamp associated with the call data event keywords included in the call data event and combinations thereof. Advantageously data may be collected automatically by various mechanisms within the present technology or may be collected and recorded by call center agents such as customer service agents.

In general call audio data for a call event may be recorded to a single channel e.g. mono channel and stored as an audio file. The audio file may include individual segments that belong to different speakers. That is a natural chronological progression of a call event may include various segments where individuals such as agents customers or fraudsters take turns engaging one another in a conversational manner. For example a call center agent and a customer may engage in a dialog wherein the speakers alternate talking to each other.

Generic diarization techniques may be utilized to separate segments and identify the segments as belonging to a unique speaker. However these generic diarization techniques may separate call audio data based upon analysis of the call audio data using voice recognition technologies that have limited accuracy. In addition to improving speed rule based diarization can increase the accuracy of the diarization since known non audio information may be brought to bear.

Complications encountered during diarization may stem from high volume of call events encountered by an enterprise causing the enterprise to utilize compression techniques to reduce the file size of call audio data. Such techniques may lead to degradation of the quality of the call audio data which in turn complicates generic diarization techniques. Other complications may arise as the number of unique speakers in the call audio data increases.

The present technology may leverage business logic to increase the efficacy of diarization processes. For example the present technology may generate different types of call schemas that comprise rules that may be applied to the diarization process to streamline the diarization process. For example some business rules may be applied to the diarization of the call audio data to quickly determine the role of a speaker e.g. agent customer . Non limiting examples of business rules that may be applied to the diarization include an appreciation for the chronological nature of different types of call events. In one instance outbound call events from the enterprise indicate that the first speaker will probably be the customer. In another instance inbound call events often begin with the call center agent as the first speaker.

Additionally efficient determination of call audio data may reduce the need to evaluate an entire call audio file. Other exemplary advantages may include the generation and management of the call schema along with methods for matching call audio data received from an enterprise to a suitable call schema or in some embodiments multiple call schemas.

Often the goal of diarization is to remove segments that include the call center agent s voice for purposes of selecting segments including the incoming customer voice. The selected segments may then be concatenated and or a voice model may extracted from the customer segments. The present technology may generate and manage agent voice models that may be stored in a database. Call audio data may be compared against the agent voice models in the database and the comparison may be utilized as the basis to remove audio segments that are determined to belong to call center agents further increasing the efficiency of subsequent diarization and or fraud detection processes.

Additionally the present technology may diarize call audio data in near real time and return a fraud indicator for the call audio data during the duration of the call event. In this way call center agents may receive notification that a caller with which they are currently engaged may be a suspected or confirmed fraudster. Such a determination may allow the call center agent to terminate the call before the fraudster is allowed to commit a fraudulent act or may allow the call center agent to obtain additional information from the fraudster that may be stored in a fraudster record.

These and other advantages of the present technology are described infra with reference to the collective drawings .

Referring now to a block diagram of an exemplary implementation of a system for fraud detection is shown in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. As can be seen from an enterprise call center a fraud detection system and a plurality of callers are shown. The call center may receive and process calls on behalf of an enterprise. The enterprise may include a merchant an insurance company an affiliate of a company a bank a telecommunication company a cellular service provider a credit card company a credit card service company and the like.

According to some embodiments the call center may receive calls from the plurality of callers hereinafter the callers for goods and or services provided by the enterprise. The callers may call the call center using a VoIP Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN mobile network A. The calls from the callers may enter an automatic call distributor which distributes calls across individual agents . Calls events may be recorded by a recording device of the call center and later processed for fraud detection. It will be understood that the callers may include legitimate customers and fraudsters.

The callers may request call center agents who receive phone calls to process transactions related to goods services. In some embodiments the call center may apply one or more business rules to decide whether to process a transaction directly or to have a fraud check performed on the caller.

The term call data for a call event or a segment of the call event may be understood to include not only audio data e.g. audio signals or call audio data for the call event but non audio data for the call event as well. The term call audio data for the call event or segment of the call event may be understood to include the audio portion of the call data e.g. audio signals . Call audio data audio sample audio signal and audio data may be used interchangeably. The above described examples of audio signal data are to be understood to be non limiting and one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many other types of audio signal may likewise be utilized in accordance with the present technology. Additionally audio information or data may be extracted from call audio data including both speaker models or voice models that represent the voice of a speaker and channel models that represent a communication profile of an audio path for a channel used by the speaker. The communications profile may include noise models background noise transfer path functions also referred to as call transfer profiles as will be described in greater detail infra as well as other representative characteristics that may be determined for a communications channel that would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.

It will be understood that the channel model for a segment of call audio data may be sufficiently unique to determine that two separate segments of call audio data belong to two separate speakers. For example a customer calling into an enterprise may have a channel model that is inherently distinctive relative to the channel model associated with call center agents of the enterprise. Therefore differences in channel models may alone suffice as a basis for diarizing and separating segments of call audio data. Similarly differences in amplitude may be used as a basis for diarizing the call audio data.

The term speaker model may be understood to include a voice model representing the unique characteristics of an individual s voice and or a language model representing linguistic characteristics of the speaker. The voice model may include a collection of features that are extracted from an audio signal of the individual s voice and encoded within a specific statistical framework. In various embodiments these features include cadence tone rate of speech spectral characteristics and or other descriptive information about the voice and vocal track of the speaker that describes the speaker separately from the words spoken . Other synonyms for a voice model may include but are not limited to a voice signature a voice print speaker model a voice portion of a speaker model and also in some instances simply a speaker voice.

In various embodiments the language model is comprised of features or characteristics such as the words spoken and speech choices made by the speaker and a statistical framework for encoding those features. Examples of a statistical framework include the probability of an occurrence of a string of words and how that probability is calculated. In various embodiments the language model includes language s spoken word choice word order accent grammar diction slang jargon rate of speech and or the like. It is noteworthy that in some instances information in addition to a speaker model voice model and language model can be extracted from diarized call audio data. For example a channel model may be extracted from diarized call audio data as described elsewhere herein. Further word spotting or word recognition may be used to extract non audio data for example name account number social security number address and or the like from diarized call audio data.

In some embodiments all callers are recorded automatically using the ACD and an audio signal and or non audio data is stored for all calls. Additionally the audio signal may be time stamped. Call audio data may be streamed for processing in real time and or recorded and stored for processing. In some embodiments the audio signal is streamed or processed without being recorded. For example the audio signal may be routed directly from the ACD to the file transfer server . In other embodiments a portion of the calls are recorded and or stored.

The present technology may also enroll diarized voice signals determined to correspond to a fraudster into a blacklist that includes speaker channel models determined to be associated with fraudsters. For additional details regarding the enrollment of speaker models into a blacklist see e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11 404 342 11 754 974 11 754 975 12 352 530 12 856 037 12 856 118 12 856 200 which are all hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. Similarly the present technology may enroll the diarized channel signals determined to correspond to a fraudster into a blacklist that includes channel models determined to be associated with fraudsters.

Customer accounts for each legitimate customer may be stored in an account database . Additionally call data including call audio data and or call non audio data for call events may be stored in the account database or may be linked to the customer account via a screening identification that associates a particular call event with a customer account. Therefore both legitimate and fraudulent call data events may be linked to the customer account.

In some embodiments the call center includes a fraud management system that receives data indicative of potential or actual fraudulent activities from the FDS . The fraud management system may utilize the fraud data provided by the fraud detection system along with other enterprise specific information to process and remedy fraudulent account activity.

A file transfer server of the call center may communicate recorded call data and or streamed call data to the FDS using Internet LAN B. The Internet LAN may utilize a secure communications protocol. File transfer server may communicate call audio data and or call non audio data to a diarization system via an application programming interface API or any other suitable data transmission protocols which may be secured or insecure. File transfer server may also received diarized data back from the diarization system via the same communications protocols. Additional operational details of the diarization system are described in greater detail with regard to .

It will be understood that the FDS may detect any type of fraud. However for the purposes of brevity the present disclosure focuses on fraud perpetrated by fraudsters utilizing telephonic devices. While not shown the FDS may include additional modules or engines that determine fraud and generate fraud reports. Additional details regarding the FDS have been omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present technology. See e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 415 816 filed Mar. 8 2012 entitled SYSTEMS METHODS AND MEDIA FOR GENERATING HIERARCHICAL FUSED RISK SCORES and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 415 809 filed Mar. 8 2012 entitled SYSTEMS METHODS AND MEDIA FOR DETERMINING FRAUD RISK FROM AUDIO SIGNALS all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.

Speaker models and or channel models may be enrolled in one or more fraudster databases blacklists and may be used as a corpus that may be queried against for comparing voice and or channel data of a candidate audio sample. The enrollment of speaker models into a fraudster database may use one or more precursor fraud databases. Speaker models may be extracted from audio in a precursor fraud database that is associated with the matched audio sample identifiers and enrolled into a fraudster database.

A precursor fraud database may be seeded with diarized audio samples and associated audio sample identifiers collected without regard to fraudulent activity associated with the audio samples. The audio sample identifiers may be matched with identifiers in a fraud report. Further details regarding precursor fraud databases well as the enrollment of fraudster voice signature speaker models into a fraudster database blacklist using precursor fraud databases are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11 404 342 11 754 974 11 754 975 12 352 530 12 856 037 12 856 118 12 856 200 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. Channel model enrollment may be performed in a similar manner to speaker model enrollment as described in these U.S. Patent Applications.

The audio sample identifiers e.g. non audio data may include any type of information that links the audio signal with the fraud identifiers. In various embodiments the audio sample identifiers include one or a combination of a call identifier a customer account a timestamp identity information name social security number etc. agent information agent communications device e.g. cellular telephone landline and computing system that communicates via VoIP protocols and or the like. Information for a communications device may include data such as ANI IMEI caller identification and so forth. As will be discussed below channel models extracted from audio in the precursor fraud database that is associated with the matched audio sample identifiers may be enrolled into the fraudster database in a manner similar to speaker models.

In some embodiments the FDS includes the diarization system . The diazization system may be utilized to leverage business logic within diarization processes to separate call audio data for unique speakers from combined call audio data output. These diarized audio files may be subsequently processed to determine if the unique speaker in the audio file is associated with a fraudster a call center agent or a legitimate customer.

Generally speaking the application may include a call schema generator a communications module an analysis module a diarization module that includes an agent voice model sub module a segment grouping module an annotation module a user interface module a database module and an enrollment module .

It is noteworthy that the diarization system may include additional modules engines or components and still fall within the scope of the present technology. As used herein the term module may also refer to any of an application specific integrated circuit ASIC an electronic circuit a processor shared dedicated or group that executes one or more software or firmware programs a combinational module circuit and or other suitable components that provide the described functionality. In other embodiments individual modules of the diarization system may include separately configured web servers.

In some embodiments the diarization system may be implemented in a cloud computing environment. Generally speaking a cloud computing environment or cloud is a resource that typically combines the computational power of a large grouping of processors and or that combines the storage capacity of a large grouping of computer memories or storage devices. For example systems that provide a cloud resource may be utilized exclusively by their owners such as Google or Yahoo or such systems may be accessible to outside users who deploy applications within the computing infrastructure to obtain the benefit of large computational or storage resources.

The cloud may be formed for example by a network of servers with each server providing processor and or storage resources. These servers may manage workloads provided by multiple users e.g. cloud resource customers or other users . Typically each user may place workload demands upon the cloud that vary in real time sometimes dramatically. The nature and extent of these variations typically depends on the type of business associated with the user.

The present technology leverages the computational resources of distributed computing e.g. cloud computing systems to facilitate efficient diarization of call audio data.

It is envisioned that the diarization system may cooperate with the FDS or may in some embodiments function as a stand alone diarization system that may be utilized by an enterprise separate from the FDS .

In other embodiments a portion or potentially all portions of diarization system may be integrated into FDS while in other embodiments the constituent modules of the diarization system may be remotely distributed from one another in a remote computing arrangement wherein each of the modules may communicate with one another via the Internet utilizing any one or combination of a number of communications protocols or communications mechanisms e.g. API HTTP FTP etc. .

According to some embodiments prior to diarization of call audio data the present technology may execute the call schema generator to generate call schemas that include rules associated with business logic. In some instances these rules may represent particular attributes of call scenarios for an enterprise. The call schema may function as a template that may be queried against for example to compare with call attributes of call audio data. The template may include a vast array of different types of information that defines particular call attributes for common call scenarios. For example a call scenario may describe data associated with outbound sales calls. Characteristics for the outbound sales call that define the call schema may include that the first speaker will be the customer typically followed by a response from the call center agent. The outbound sales call may also include information such as common outbound telephone numbers or a typical time frame associated with outbound sales calls. In some embodiments the call schema generator includes one or more voice models that may be used for identifying segments of audio containing one or more known speakers e.g. call center agents in the call audio data. Using this information the analysis module may be able to quickly identify the first unique speaker as the customer.

Other information that may be included in the call schema may include keywords that will frequently be spoken by a call center agent such as with a call script. Other types of call schema information may include expected call duration call time data telephone number automatic number identification ANI and so forth. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the vast amount of information that may be utilized to define a call schema. Regardless of the type of information included in the call schema the present technology may apply the rules associated with the call schema to diarization processes to produce more efficiently diarized audio files.

Many types of call schema may be generated by the call schema generator for an enterprise depending upon the various functions performed by the enterprise. As such an enterprise may have several call schemas for inbound outbound sales calls technical support calls general inquiry calls and so forth.

In some embodiments the call schema generator may cause the user interface module to display the generated call schemas to allow for manual review of the same. End users may modify a call schema generated by the call schema generator if errors are determined in the call schema or if the end user desires to include additional business rules in the call schema.

In some instances an enterprise may be engaged to provide a limited or known function such as outbound sales calls. In these instances the call schema generator may only generate a single call schema that may be applied to each instance of call audio data received.

After the establishment of one or more call schema by the call schema generator and upon receiving call audio data by the communications module the analysis module is then executed to apply at least one call schema for the received call audio data. It is noteworthy to mention that an enterprise may only utilize a single call schema so in some instances the call schema may include a default call schema.

The analysis module may parse the call data e.g. into segment to determine call characteristics that indicate the type of call schema that is to be applied to the call audio data. For example the call data may include data such as an inbound phone number for the call audio data. It may be inferred that the only calls received by this particular inbound phone number are directed to billing inquiries. Therefore an inbound billing inquiry call schema may be applied to the diarization process as described in greater detail below.

The analysis module may also process and or parse the call audio and or non audio data to determine call characteristics of the call data such as the presence and number of unique speakers call transfer functions audio quality compression techniques speech distribution speaker accents and so forth. Moreover the analysis module may determine segment lengths for each unique speaker and or segments with unique channel models and the chronological position of each segment relative to the overall timeline of the call data. A segment may include a period of the call data that is initiated when a unique voice is detected and ends when the unique voice terminates. This type of temporal data can be utilized to infer the role of a particular speaker in view of the call schema applied during diarization. For example a call center agent may be expected to do a majority of the talking while reading long passages of terms and conditions. Thus an identity of a voice as a call center agent or a customer may be inferred from a percentage of the talking performed by that voice during the call event or portion of the call event.

Additionally the analysis module may determine keywords bigrams n grams or other collections of words in the call audio data that may be utilized to determine the role of a unique speaker. For example if it is determined that a segment of call audio data includes a recitation of terms and conditions of a purchase it may be inferred that the segment is associated with a call center agent.

Call transfer functions or profiles characterize the changes to an audio signal as it traverses a path through a channel from the source to the analysis module . For example the call transfer profile of a microphone may characterize the microphone as an attenuator and or a band pass filter that includes roll off or clipping of frequencies outside of a range e.g. the range 100 Hz 5 000 Hz . In another example the analysis module may use a call transfer profile characteristic of a voice changer to determine the presence or use of a voice modifier. If the analysis module detects use of a voice modifier the call audio data may be immediately flagged as being associated with a fraudster. A call transfer profile may also be used to detect the presence and types of compression used in the path of the audio. Thus a call transfer or profile may indicate the type of communications channel s and or communications devices that were utilized by a caller. See e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 415 809 for further details of call transfer functions or profiles.

Call data may also be gathered by the analysis module from data associated with the call audio data such as time stamping annotated notes generated by call center agents and so forth.

Utilizing the call schema and the call characteristics for the call audio data the diarization module may be executed to efficiently diarize the call audio data. Diarization of call audio data may begin by separating the call audio data into segments that belong to unique speakers using the call schema. The diarization module may identify the segments as belonging to various speakers. Multiple segments may be associated with a single speaker. The diarization module may group the segments belonging to a specific speaker.

The diarization module may execute the segment grouping module which uses the schema to identify segments containing various speakers. In some applications the diarization module may execute the agent voice model sub module which uses the schema to identify segments containing a call center agent. For example the agent voice model sub module may compare the call audio data or individual segments of call audio data to one or more voice models in a database of agent voice models. Agent voice models may be generated and managed for each call center agent or a subset of call center agents for an enterprise. The voice model may be generated from a single audio file or may include a plurality or sampling of a plurality of audio data points for a particular agent that may be combined into an agent voice model. In some instances the agent voice model is associated with an agent identifier e.g. agent ID that may be annotated into or associated with call data generated from call events in which the call center agent participated. Such identifying information may be utilized by the agent voice model sub module and or segment grouping module in detecting and removing segments associated with a call center agent.

If the call audio data includes one or more segments that substantially correspond to an agent voice model the agent voice model sub module and or segment grouping module may annotate the segment as being associated with a call center agent. Alternatively the agent voice model sub module and or segment grouping module redact the segment as being associated with a call center agent. In some instances when the agent voice model sub module compares a segment to an agent voice model the agent voice model sub module may determine that the segment is statistically likely to correspond to an agent voice model based upon discrepancies between the segment and the voice model. These discrepancies may be expressed as a percentage of difference and compared against a threshold value. For example only segments that have a high probability greater than 95 of corresponding to an agent voice model may be redacted whereas segments that have a lower probability may be annotated for further review.

Additionally similar probabilistic analyses may be performed on agent audio in the creation of a composite agent voice model. For example the sub module may evaluate fifty segments that are potentially attributable to a call center agent. These segments may each be compared to a verified voice model for the agent and only segments that have a high probability of corresponding to the call center agent will be utilized to generate the composite voice model. In this way the agent voice model sub module may update the voice model for the agent over time.

In addition to the use of agent voice models the present technology may utilize other types of profiles that represent call audio that can be redacted from the call audio data. Non limiting examples of profiles include a music profile a prompt profile an advertisement profile and a channel profile just to name a few. Specifically the music profile may include audio characteristics for the on hold music played during the call event which also may include words included in the on hold music as well as determining spoken words immediately following the playing of music. Similar profiles may be created from audio present in system prompts such as automated directory information or dial by number audio prompts. The diarization module may recognize segments that correspond to a profile and remove such segments during diarization. Also in some instances channel models or certain channel model characteristics such as noise may also be removed.

In some embodiments the diarization module is configured to utilize the call characteristics gathered by the analysis module along with other types of data determined by the agent voice model sub module to remove segments of call audio data that are not of interest e.g. segments belonging to agents on hold music prompts announcements advertising etc. 

The segment grouping module of diarization module is configured to identify segments as belonging to unique callers using the call schema. The segment grouping module may group together segments belonging to unique callers into individual audio files. For example the segment grouping module may be executed to collect and or splice together segments for a unique speaker into a single audio file.

The annotation module may be executed to associate non audio data with the segments. The segment grouping module may use schema and the associated non audio data to identify various speakers of the segments.

Once audio segments have been grouped together by the segment grouping module the grouped segments may be analyzed to determine if there is a match with a fraudster e.g. using the fraud detection system . If a match is found between the grouped segments and a fraudster the fraud management system may notify a merchant or other third party. The fraud management system may further extract a voice model and enroll for enrollment into a fraudster database. The analysis may be performed in real time near real time and or on data that has been recorded and stored.

The grouped segments may be stored in a storage media in the form of a file store such as database of . The segments may be stored by the database module . The grouped segments may be displayed in a visual and or audio format via the user interface module . The proposed diarizations of call audio data may be displayed via the user interface module such that end users may manually review modify and or approve a diarization of the call audio data. That is one or more segments may be indicated as belonging to a particular speaker and each segment may include data indicative of the segment such as a time stamp a link to a matching voice model e.g. potentially a fraudster or agent and so forth. The segments may be arranged in chronological order. In other embodiments the audio files generated by the segment grouping module may be displayed concurrently with the visual representation of call audio data.

Manual verification may reduce the likelihood that the enhanced diarization methods described herein may produce errant diarized audio files. Modifications or approvals of proposed diarizations may be fed back into the logic utilized by the analysis module to vary and or enhance the manner in which future analysis diarization processes are executed.

During manual verification the annotation module may be executed to receive annotations corresponding to changes received from end user input. The annotation module may cooperate with the database module to ensure that descriptive information concerning the manual verification processes is memorialized. These annotations may include a change log for a segment or an audio file that includes time stamps for each modification agent identification nature of modification call identification information identification tags for voice signatures and the like.

The database module may also be executed to manage the aforementioned call profiles and cooperate with the agent voice model sub module to manage the storage and access to agent voice models. The database module may store segments audio files voice models profiles or any other disclosed data in a database such as database although the diarization system may also include a local storage medium.

Diarized audio files including grouped segments may be transmitted to the FDS and compared against a blacklist that includes voice models associated with known fraudster. If an audio file substantially corresponds to a voice model associated with a fraudster a signal or warning notification may be relayed back to the call center .

Segments of audio may be analyzed by the FDS in real time as they are diarized and even before separation and or identification of other segments has been completed. In instances where diarization and fraud detection preferably occur during the duration of a call event and a match between an audio file and a fraudster voice model has been detected by the FDS the diarization process may be terminated after notification has been relayed back to the call center . The notification may be communicated directly to the call center agent involved in the call event. The notification may be communicated before completion of diarizing the entire call event.

Therefore in some embodiments the diarization process may only require analysis of a subset of the segments and subjecting those segments to fraud detection processes until a fraud determination can be reached for the call event. As such an entire audio file may not be diarized and or generated for each unique speaker.

Once a match between grouped segments and a fraudster has been determined the enrollment module may enroll the grouped segments directly into a fraudster database. As stated previously the enrollment of voice models in a fraudster database blacklist creates a fraudster database that may be used as a corpus of voice models that may be queried against for comparing a voice models voice signatures or voiceprints of a segment to voice models for known fraudsters. The voice model includes a set of voice characteristics that uniquely identify a person s voice. In one embodiment each voice model in the fraudster database may be assigned an identifier ID . The ID may be unique. In addition attributes may be associated with the fraudster such as a social security number or a credit card number that the fraudster has used.

The enrollment of voice models may include populating one or more precursor fraud databases using the voice models and associated ID without regard to fraudulent activities. Then a fraud identifiers in a fraud report may be compared to ID s associated with voice models in the precursor database to populate a fraudster database. See e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 404 342.

Additionally similarly to agent voice models the present technology may utilize the correspondence between audio segments and fraudster voice models to compare the correspondence values to thresholds. Voice models for segments or audio files that have a high probability of correspondence to a voice model for a fraudster may be annotated or immediately flagged as indicating a potential fraudster. Additionally channel models indicative of a channel characteristic for a segment of call audio data may also be flagged as indicating a potential fraudster. See e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 415 816. For example a channel model may indicate that the call originated from a cellular telephone in a particular country. Because cellular telephones originating from a particular country may indicate potential fraud the segment s originating from that country may be flagged for further review.

Next the method may include a step of diarizing the call audio data by executing a step of applying one or more rules that affect separation of the call audio data into segments. It is noteworthy that the rules may be associated with the at least one call schema. Also diarization may include a step of separating the call audio data into segments according to the one or more schema rules.

The method may include an optional step of redacting or removing segments determined to be associated with a call center agent. The method further includes a step of grouping segments associated with the speaker. Finally the method includes a step of storing in a storage media an identifier and the grouped segments for the speaker.

It will be understood that the method may include additional or fewer or steps that those listed above. Additionally optional steps have been shown as dotted lined objects in the Figures.

It is noteworthy to mention that the rules may be associated with the at least one call schema. Additionally diarization may include a step of separating the call audio data into segments according to the one or more rules where each segment is associated with a unique speaker.

Next the method may include a step of comparing a segment to fraud profiles associated with known fraudsters before a step of returning before the end of the call event notification to the client device if the segment substantially corresponds to a fraud profile associated with a known fraudster.
