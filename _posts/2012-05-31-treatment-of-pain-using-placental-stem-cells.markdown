In specific embodiments of any of the embodiments herein said placental stem cells are additionally OCT 4. In certain embodiments said placental stem cells are formulated to be administered locally. In certain other embodiments said placental stem cells are formulated to be administered systemically e.g. intravenously or intraarterially.

As used herein the term about when referring to a stated numeric value indicates a value within plus or minus 10 of the stated numeric value.

As used herein the term derived means isolated from or otherwise purified. For example placental derived adherent cells are isolated from placenta. The term derived encompasses cells that are cultured from cells isolated directly from a tissue e.g. the placenta and cells cultured or expanded from primary isolates.

As used herein immunolocalization means the detection of a compound e.g. a cellular marker using an immune protein e.g. an antibody or fragment thereof in for example flow cytometry fluorescence activated cell sorting magnetic cell sorting in situ hybridization immunohistochemistry or the like.

As used herein the term SH2 refers to an antibody that binds an epitope on the marker CD105. Thus cells that are referred to as SH2 are CD105.

As used herein the terms SH3 and SH4 refer to antibodies that bind epitopes present on the marker CD73. Thus cells that are referred to as SH3 and or SH4 are CD73.

As used herein a stem cell is isolated if at least 50 60 70 80 90 95 or at least 99 of the other cells with which the stem cell is naturally associated are removed from the stem cell e.g. during collection and or culture of the stem cell. A population of isolated cells means a population of cells that is substantially separated from other cells of the tissue e.g. placenta from which the population of cells is derived. In some embodiments a population of e.g. stem cells is isolated if at least 50 60 70 80 90 95 or at least 99 of the cells with which the population of stem cells are naturally associated are removed from the population of stem cells e.g. during collection and or culture of the population of stem cells.

As used herein the term placental stem cell refers to a stem cell or progenitor cell that is derived from e.g. isolated from a mammalian placenta regardless of the number of passages after a primary culture which adheres to a tissue culture substrate e.g. tissue culture plastic or a fibronectin coated tissue culture plate . The term placental stem cell as used herein does not however refer to a trophoblast a cytotrophoblast embryonic germ cell or embryonic stem cell as those cells are understood by persons of skill in the art. A cell is considered a stem cell if the cell retains at least one attribute of a stem cell e.g. a marker or gene expression profile associated with one or more types of stem cells the ability to replicate at least 10 40 times in culture multipotency e.g. the ability to differentiate either in vitro in vivo or both into cells of one or more of the three germ layers the lack of adult i.e. differentiated cell characteristics or the like. The terms placental stem cell and placenta derived stem cell may be used interchangeably. Unless otherwise noted herein the term placental includes the umbilical cord. The placental stem cells disclosed herein are in certain embodiments multipotent in vitro that is the cells differentiate in vitro under differentiating conditions multipotent in vivo that is the cells differentiate in vivo or both.

As used herein a stem cell is positive for a particular marker when that marker is detectable. For example a placental stem cell is positive for e.g. CD73 because CD73 is detectable on placental stem cells in an amount detectably greater than background in comparison to e.g. an isotype control or an experimental negative control for any given assay . A cell is also positive for a marker when that marker can be used to distinguish the cell from at least one other cell type or can be used to select or isolate the cell when present or expressed by the cell.

As used herein immunomodulation and immunomodulatory mean causing or having the capacity to cause a detectable change in an immune response and the ability to cause a detectable change in an immune response.

Described herein are methods of treating pain comprising the administration of placental derived cells e.g. placental stem cells e.g. the placental stem cells described in Section 5.4 below or prepared as described in Example 7 below. In specific embodiments the placental stem cells used in the methods for treating pain described herein are CD10 CD34 CD105 and CD200.

Pain is generally defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Merskey H Bogduk N eds. Classification of Chronic Pain International Association for the Study of Pain IASP Task Force on Taxonomy IASP Press Seattle 209 214 1994. Because the perception of pain is highly subjective it is one of the most difficult pathologies to diagnose and treat effectively.

In one aspect provided herein is a method of treating an individual having pain comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of placental stem cells or culture medium conditioned by placental stem cells wherein the therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to cause a detectable improvement in said pain or a symptom associated with said pain. In one embodiment said method additionally comprises determining a first level of pain in said individual prior to administration of said placental stem cells and determining a second level of pain in said individual after administration of said placental stem cells wherein said therapeutically effective amount of placental stem cells reduces said second level of said pain as compared to said first level of pain.

In certain embodiments the therapeutically effective amount of placental stem cells when administered results in greater or more long lasting improvement of pain in the individual as compared to administration of a placebo.

In certain embodiments the pain is nociceptive pain. Nociceptive pain is typically elicited when noxious stimuli such as inflammatory chemical mediators are released following tissue injury disease or inflammation and are detected by normally functioning sensory receptors nociceptors at the site of injury.

In certain embodiments the administration of placental stem cells to an individual in accordance with the methods described herein results in a reduction in pain in the individual without an accompanying side effect that is associated with one or more drugs indicated used for treatment of pain e.g. gabapentin. In a specific embodiment the use of placental stem cells in accordance with the methods described herein results in reduction of pain in an individual to whom the placental stem cells are administered but does not result in sensory and or motor coordination deficiency in said individual.

In one embodiment the therapeutically effective amount of placental stem cells administered to the individual having pain is an amount that results in a detectable reduction in the pain in the individual. The reduction can be detectable to the individual detectable to an observer or both. In certain embodiments of the methods of treatment provided herein the level of pain in the individual is assessed by the individual e.g. as guided by a medical doctor or as part of a pre treatment workup according to one or more individual pain scales. In certain other embodiments the level of pain in the individual is assessed by an observer using one or more observer pain scales. Where levels of pain are assessed according to the method before and after administration of placental stem cells the same scale is preferably used for each assessment. Pain in the individual can be assessed once or more than once e.g. 2 3 4 or 5 times before administration of placental stem cells and once or more than once e.g. 2 3 4 or 5 times after administration of placental stem cells.

In one embodiment pain in the individual is assessed by the 0 10 Numeric Pain Intensity Scale. In this scale zero equals no pain and 10 equals the worst pain. In certain embodiments e.g. the Pain Quality Assessment Scale the pain is broken down into more than one numeric descriptor e.g. 0 10 for how hot the pain feels 0 10 for how intense the pain feels 0 10 for how sharp the pain feels 0 10 for how dull the pain feels 0 10 for how cold the pain feels 0 10 for how sensitive the pain feels 0 10 for how tender the pain feels 0 10 for how itchy the pain feels 0 10 for how shooting the pain feels 0 10 for how numb the pain feels 0 10 for how tingling the pain feels 0 10 for how electrical the pain feels 0 10 for how cramping the pain feels 0 10 for how throbbing the pain feels 0 10 for how radiating the pain feels 0 10 for how aching the pain feels 0 10 for how heavy the pain feels and or 0 10 for how unpleasant the pain feels.

In another embodiment pain in the individual is assessed by the Simple Descriptive Pain Intensity Scale. In this scale pain is described as e.g. no pain mild pain moderate pain severe pain very severe pain or worst possible pain .

In another embodiment pain in the individual is assessed by the Visual Analog Scale. In the Visual Analog Scale the individual is presented with a graph consisting of a vertical line one end of the line is labeled no pain and the other end is labeled worst possible pain . The individual is asked to mark the line at a point between the two ends indicating the level of pain perceived by the individual.

In another embodiment pain in the individual is assessed by the Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. In the FACES Pain Rating Scale the level of pain is indicated by a series of cartoon faces typically six faces appearing happy to progressively more unhappy. In a specific embodiment the faces are subtexted with phrases such as no hurt hurts little bit hurts little more hurts even more hurts whole lot and hurts worst . In another specific embodiment the faces are subtexted with phrases such as no pain mild annoying pain nagging uncomfortable troublesome pain distressing miserable pain intense dreadful horrible pain and worst possible unbearable excruciating pain either alone or accompanied by a numeric 0 to 10 scale.

In certain embodiments pain in the individual is assessed by the FLACC Face Legs Activity Cry and Consolability scale. In specific embodiments each of the five characteristics is rated from e.g. 0 to 2 with 2 indicating pain and 0 indicating no pain. The scores may be used separately or totaled.

In certain other embodiment pain in the individual is assessed by the CRIES Crying Requires Ofor SaO hemoglobin saturation Increased vital signs blood pressure and heart rate Expression and Sleepless scale. In specific embodiments each of the five characteristics is rated from e.g. 0 to 2 with 2 indicating pain and 0 indicating no pain. The scores may be used separately or totaled.

In certain embodiment pain in the individual is assessed by the COMFORT scale which assesses nine different characteristics alertness calmness respiratory distress crying physical movement muscle tone facial tension blood pressure and heart rate each rated on a scale of 1 5 with 1 indicating no or least pain and 5 most pain. The scores may be used individually or totaled.

As used herein treatment of pain and the like can comprise completely eliminating pain noticeable reduction of pain by the individual suffering the pain detectable reduction of pain or indicia of pain by objective criteria e.g. heart rate blood pressure muscle tone or the like or a combination of any two or all three. In certain other embodiments pain in the individual can be assessed either before or after administration of placental stem cells or both by physiological criteria e.g. physiological criteria of stress. Such physiological criteria can include objectively measurable criteria such as heart rate or blood pressure e.g. elevated heart rate or blood pressure as compared to a non pain state in the individual or as compared to an expected norm e.g. 120 systolic and 80 diastolic 60 beats per minute .

Inflammation is not a sole source of pain. However in certain embodiments placental stem cells can be used to ameliorate pain related to or caused by inflammation. In one embodiment provided herein is a method for the amelioration of pain in an individual comprising contacting immune cell s in the individual with an effective amount of placental stem cells wherein said effective amount is an amount that 1 detectably suppresses an immune response in said individual and 2 detectably reduces pain in said individual. In specific embodiments said placental stem cells detectably suppress T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction MLR assay or a regression assay. The contacting can be accomplished by e.g. administering the placental stem cells to the individual e.g. locally systemically or regionally or by a combination of such . Thus provided herein is a method for the amelioration of pain in an individual comprising contacting immune cell s in the individual with an effective amount of placental stem cells wherein said effective amount is an amount that 1 detectably modulates e.g. suppresses an immune and or inflammatory response in said individual and 2 detectably reduces pain in said individual. In a specific embodiment contacting immune cell s in the individual with an effective amount of placental stem cells results in a decrease in the amount of IL 2 IL 6 IL 12 IL 17 and or interferon or any combination thereof in the individual. In another specific embodiment contacting immune cell s in the individual with an effective amount of placental stem cells results in a decrease in the amount of CCL2 CCL12 and or CXCL1 or any combination thereof in the individual. In another specific embodiment contacting immune cell s in the individual with an effective amount of placental stem cells results in an increase in the amount of IL 10 in the individual.

An immune cell in the context of this method means any cell of the immune system adaptive or innate particularly T cells and NK natural killer cells dendritic cells and macrophages. Thus in various embodiments of the method placental stem cells are contacted with a plurality of immune cells wherein the plurality of immune cells are or comprises a plurality of T cells e.g. a plurality of CD3 T cells CD4 T cells and or CD8 T cells and or natural killer cells. An immune response in the context of the method can be any response by an immune cell to a stimulus normally perceived by an immune cell e.g. a response to the presence of an antigen. In various embodiments an immune response can be the proliferation of T cells e.g. CD3 T cells CD4 T cells and or CD8 T cells in response to a foreign antigen such as an antigen present in a transfusion or graft or to a self antigen as in an autoimmune disease. The immune response can also be a proliferation of T cells contained within a graft. The immune response can also be any activity of a natural killer NK cell the maturation of a dendritic cell the differentiation of T cells skewing macrophages into the M1 or M2 lineage or the like.

Placental stem cells used for reduction or amelioration of pain e.g. by reduction of inflammation can also be derived from a single species e.g. the species of the intended recipient or the species of the immune cells the function of which is to be reduced or suppressed or can be derived from multiple species.

In various embodiments said contacting is sufficient to suppress an immune function e.g. T cell proliferation in response to an antigen or inflammation in an individual afflicted with pain by at least 50 60 70 80 90 or 95 compared to the immune function in the absence of the placental stem cells. Such suppression in an in vivo context can be determined in an in vitro assay see below using e.g. a sample of T cells from the individual that is the degree of suppression in the in vitro assay can be extrapolated for a particular number of placental stem cells and a number of immune cells in a recipient individual to a degree of suppression in the individual.

Placental stem cells can be tested e.g. in an MLR comprising combining CD4 or CD8 T cells dendritic cells DC and placental stem cells in a ratio of about 10 1 2 wherein the T cells are stained with a dye such as e.g. CFSE that partitions into daughter cells and wherein the T cells are allowed to proliferate for about 6 days. The T cells and or DC cells can be obtained from the individual to be treated e.g. can be autologous to the individual or can be allogeneic to the individual. The placental stem cells are immunosuppressive if the T cell proliferation at 6 days in the presence of placental stem cells is detectably reduced compared to T cell proliferation in the presence of DC and absence of placental stem cells. In one embodiment of an MLR for example placental stem cells can be either thawed or harvested from culture. About 20 000 placental stem cells are resuspended in 100 l of medium RPMI 1640 1 mM HEPES buffer antibiotics and 5 pooled human serum and allowed to attach to the bottom of a well for 2 hours. CD4 and or CD8 T cells are isolated from whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells Miltenyi magnetic beads. The cells are CFSE stained and a total of 100 000 T cells CD4 T cells alone CD8 T cells alone or equal amounts of CD4 and CD8 T cells are added per well. The volume in the well is brought to 200 l and the MLR is allowed to proceed.

In certain embodiments the anti inflammatory activity i.e. immunosuppressive activity of the placental stem cells is determined prior to administration to the individual suffering pain. This can be accomplished for example by determining the immunosuppressive activity of a sample of the placental stem cells to be administered for the amelioration of pain. Such an activity can be determined for example by testing a sample of the placental stem cells or placental stem cells in e.g. an MLR or regression assay. In one embodiment an MLR is performed with the sample and a degree of immunosuppression demonstrated by the sample placental stem cells in the assay is determined. The degree of pain amelioration is expected to correlate with the immunosuppressive activity of the sampled placental stem cells. Thus the MLR can be used as a method of determining the absolute and relative ability of a particular population of placental stem cells or placental stem cells to ameliorate pain attributable to inflammation.

The parameters of the MLR can be varied to provide more data or to best determine the capacity of a sample of placental stem cells or placental stem cells to immunosuppress and therefore ameliorate pain. For example because immunosuppression by placental stem cells appears to increase roughly in proportion to the number of placental stem cells present in the assay the MLR can be performed with in one embodiment two or more numbers of placental stem cells e.g. 1 10 3 10 1 10and or 3 10placental stem cells per reaction. The number of placental stem cells relative to the number of T cells in the assay can also be varied. For example placental stem cells and T cells in the assay can be present in any ratio of e.g. about 10 1 to about 1 10 preferably about 1 5 though a relatively greater number of placental stem cells or T cells can be used.

Placental stem cells can be administered to an individual in a ratio with respect to a known or expected number of immune cells e.g. T cells in the individual of from about 10 1 to about 1 10 preferably about 1 5. However placental stem cells can be administered to an individual in a ratio of in non limiting examples about 10 000 1 about 1 000 1 about 100 1 about 10 1 about 1 1 about 1 10 about 1 100 about 1 1 000 or about 1 10 000. Generally about 1 10to about 1 10placental stem cells per recipient kilogram preferably about 1 10to about 1 10placental stem per recipient kilogram can be administered to effect immunosuppression. In various embodiments placental stem cells administered to an individual or subject comprise at least about or no more than 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10 1 10 3 10placental stem cells or more.

The placental stem cells can also be administered with one or more second types of stem cells e.g. mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow. Such second stem cells can be administered to an individual with said placental stem cells in a ratio of e.g. between about 1 10 to about 10 1.

To facilitate contacting or proximity of placental stem cells and immune cells in vivo the placental stem cells can be administered to an individual by any route sufficient to bring the placental stem cells and immune cells into contact with each other. For example the placental stem cells can be administered to the individual e.g. intravenously intramuscularly intraperitoneally intraocularly parenterally intrathecally subcutaneously or directly into an organ e.g. pancreas. The placental stem cells can be administered to an area of an individual suffering pain at the site of pain or at a site of nerve damage causing the pain. For in vivo administration the placental stem cells can be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition as described in Section 5.8.1.2 below.

In another aspect the placental stem cells administered to the individual suffering from pain have been genetically engineered to express one or more anti inflammatory cytokines. In a specific embodiment said anti inflammatory cytokines comprise IL 10.

In any of the above methods of treatment of pain in an individual the method can comprise the administration of a second therapeutic composition or second therapy e.g. an anti pain medication or therapy.

In certain embodiments the placental stem cells described herein are characterized by their ability to reduce or ameliorate pain e.g. in an animal pain model. For example where a batch or lot of placental stem cells is produced a sample of the batch or lot can be tested using one or more animal models of pain. Placental stem cells from which samples that produce acceptable reductions in pain in a pain assay have been obtained can then be selected for further use e.g. for amelioration of any type of pain or for amelioration of a specific type of pain. It should be understood that the placental stem cells tested need only be tested in and or show efficacy in one assay to be considered therapeutically effective testing in multiple or all animal models of pain is not necessary. In certain embodiments the sample placental stem cells can be tested in a pain assay that is relevant to one or more related types of pain or pain relevant to treating a particular patient population.

In certain embodiments the placental stem cells can be tested in for example an acetic acid induced model of visceral pain. Such a study can be conducted e.g. by administering acetic acid intraperitoneally in a dose volume of about 10 mL kg to mice with vehicle or placental stem cells e.g. 1 10to 1 10 administered prior to acetic acid administration. The number of writhings are recorded for the subsequent 20 minutes after discarding the first the 5 minutes. Each experiment contains the following groups vehicle 2 5 doses of placental stem cells positive control n 10 group.

In certain other embodiments a sample of placental stem cells can be tested using the Chung spinal nerve ligation model which L5 and L6 spinal nerves are tightly ligated resulting in a stable and long lasting neuropathic pain.

In certain other embodiments a sample of placental stem cells can be tested using a taxol assay of peripheral neuropathy in which pain develops over time in the rat after the administration of a series of Taxol injections.

In certain other embodiments a sample of placental stem cells can be tested using the Bennet Model of neuropathic pain allodynia in which pain induced by application of loose ligatures around one of the sciatic nerves is shown by the sharp withdrawal of affected hind paw to light mechanical stimuli.

In certain other embodiments a sample of placental stem cells can be tested using a carrageenan administration induced model of pain.

In certain other embodiments a sample of placental stem cells can be tested using a Complete Freund s Adjuvant model of neuropathic pain e.g. allodynia . For example five rats can be used per group with an initial dose of e.g. 1 10to 1 10i.v. with efficacy determined by reduction of CFA induced hind paw hyperalgesia. Unpaired Student s t test is applied for comparison between vehicle control and treated groups. Other pain medications can be used as positive controls mg kg per os e.g. aspirin 100 cyclosporine A 100 dexamethasone 30 gabapentin 200 indomethacin 10 or morphine 30.

In certain other embodiments a sample of placental stem cells can be tested using a tail flick model in which response to tail flick pain stimulus is assessed before and after administration of the placental stem cells.

The pain assays provided herein are non limiting examples only other assays known in the art may be used as well.

The growth of the placental cells e.g. the placental stem cells described herein as for any mammalian cell depends in part upon the particular medium selected for growth. Under optimum conditions placental stem cells typically double in number in 3 5 days. During culture the placental stem cells provided herein adhere to a substrate in culture e.g. the surface of a tissue culture container e.g. tissue culture dish plastic fibronectin coated plastic and the like and form a monolayer.

Populations of isolated placental cells that comprise the placental stem cells provided herein when cultured under appropriate conditions can form embryoid like bodies that is three dimensional clusters of cells grow atop the adherent stem cell layer. Cells within the embryoid like bodies express markers associated with very early stem cells e.g. OCT 4 Nanog SSEA3 and SSEA4. Cells within the embryoid like bodies are typically not adherent to the culture substrate as are the placental stem cells described herein but remain attached to the adherent cells during culture. Embryoid like body cells are dependent upon the adherent placental stem cells for viability as embryoid like bodies do not form in the absence of the adherent stem cells. The adherent placental cells thus facilitate the growth of one or more embryoid like bodies in a population of placental cells that comprise the adherent placental cells. Mesenchymal stem cells e.g. bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells do not develop embryoid like bodies in culture.

The placental cells useful in the methods of treating pain in an individual provided herein in certain embodiments are differentiable into different committed cell lineages. For example in certain embodiments the placental cells can be differentiated into cells of an adipogenic chondrogenic neurogenic or osteogenic lineage. Such differentiation can be accomplished e.g. by any method known in the art for differentiating e.g. bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells into similar cell lineages or by methods described elsewhere herein. Specific methods of differentiating placental cells into particular cell lineages are disclosed in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 7 311 905 and in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0275362 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.

The placental stem cells provided herein can exhibit the capacity to differentiate into a particular cell lineage in vitro in vivo or in vitro and in vivo. In a specific embodiment the placental stem cells provided herein can be differentiated in vitro when placed in conditions that cause or promote differentiation into a particular cell lineage but do not detectably differentiate in vivo e.g. in a NOD SCID mouse model.

Placental stem cells can be collected and isolated according to the methods provided herein. Generally placental stem cells are obtained from a mammalian placenta using a physiologically acceptable solution e.g. a stem cell collection composition. A stem cell collection composition is described in detail in related U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 754 969 entitled Improved Composition for Collecting and Preserving Placental cells and Methods of Using the Composition filed on Dec. 29 2005.

The stem cell collection composition can comprise any physiologically acceptable solution suitable for the collection and or culture of stem cells for example a saline solution e.g. phosphate buffered saline Kreb s solution modified Kreb s solution Eagle s solution 0.9 NaCl. etc. a culture medium e.g. DMEM HDMEM etc. and the like.

The stem cell collection composition can comprise one or more components that tend to preserve placental stem cells that is prevent the placental stem cells from dying or delay the death of the placental stem cells reduce the number of placental stem cells in a population of cells that die or the like from the time of collection to the time of culturing. Such components can be e.g. an apoptosis inhibitor e.g. a caspase inhibitor or JNK inhibitor a vasodilator e.g. magnesium sulfate an antihypertensive drug atrial natriuretic peptide ANP adrenocorticotropin corticotropin releasing hormone sodium nitroprusside hydralazine adenosine triphosphate adenosine indomethacin or magnesium sulfate a phosphodiesterase inhibitor etc. a necrosis inhibitor e.g. 2 1H Indol 3 yl 3 pentylamino maleimide pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or clonazepam a TNF inhibitor and or an oxygen carrying perfluorocarbon e.g. perfluorooctyl bromide perfluorodecyl bromide etc. .

The stem cell collection composition can comprise one or more tissue degrading enzymes e.g. a metalloprotease a serine protease a neutral protease an RNase or a DNase or the like. Such enzymes include but are not limited to collagenases e.g. collagenase I II III or IV a collagenase from etc. dispase thermolysin elastase trypsin LIBERASE hyaluronidase and the like.

The stem cell collection composition can comprise a bacteriocidally or bacteriostatically effective amount of an antibiotic. In certain non limiting embodiments the antibiotic is a macrolide e.g. tobramycin a cephalosporin e.g. cephalexin cephradine cefuroxime cefprozil cefaclor cefixime or cefadroxil a clarithromycin an erythromycin a penicillin e.g. penicillin V or a quinolone e.g. ofloxacin ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin a tetracycline a streptomycin etc. In a particular embodiment the antibiotic is active against Gram and or Gram bacteria e.g. and the like.

The stem cell collection composition can also comprise one or more of the following compounds adenosine about 1 mM to about 50 mM D glucose about 20 mM to about 100 mM magnesium ions about 1 mM to about 50 mM a macromolecule of molecular weight greater than 20 000 daltons in one embodiment present in an amount sufficient to maintain endothelial integrity and cellular viability e.g. a synthetic or naturally occurring colloid a polysaccharide such as dextran or a polyethylene glycol present at about 25 g l to about 100 g l or about 40 g l to about 60 g l an antioxidant e.g. butylated hydroxyanisole butylated hydroxytoluene glutathione vitamin C or vitamin E present at about 25 M to about 100 M a reducing agent e.g. N acetylcysteine present at about 0.1 mM to about 5 mM an agent that prevents calcium entry into cells e.g. verapamil present at about 2 M to about 25 M nitroglycerin e.g. about 0.05 g L to about 0.2 g L an anticoagulant in one embodiment present in an amount sufficient to help prevent clotting of residual blood e.g. heparin or hirudin present at a concentration of about 1000 units l to about 100 000 units l or an amiloride containing compound e.g. amiloride ethyl isopropyl amiloride hexamethylene amiloride dimethyl amiloride or isobutyl amiloride present at about 1.0 M to about 5 M .

Generally a human placenta is recovered shortly after its expulsion after birth. In a preferred embodiment the placenta is recovered from a patient after informed consent and after a complete medical history of the patient is taken and is associated with the placenta. Preferably the medical history continues after delivery. Such a medical history can be used to coordinate subsequent use of the placenta or the stem cells harvested therefrom. For example human placental cells can be used in light of the medical history for personalized medicine for the infant associated with the placenta or for parents siblings or other relatives of the infant.

Prior to recovery of placental stem cells the umbilical cord blood and placental blood are removed. In certain embodiments after delivery the cord blood in the placenta is recovered. The placenta can be subjected to a conventional cord blood recovery process. Typically a needle or cannula is used with the aid of gravity to exsanguinate the placenta see e.g. Anderson U.S. Pat. No. 5 372 581 Hessel et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 415 665 . The needle or cannula is usually placed in the umbilical vein and the placenta can be gently massaged to aid in draining cord blood from the placenta. Such cord blood recovery may be performed commercially e.g. LifeBank Inc. Cedar Knolls N.J. ViaCord Cord Blood Registry and Cryocell. Preferably the placenta is gravity drained without further manipulation so as to minimize tissue disruption during cord blood recovery.

Typically a placenta is transported from the delivery or birthing room to another location e.g. a laboratory for recovery of cord blood and collection of stem cells by e.g. perfusion or tissue dissociation. The placenta is preferably transported in a sterile thermally insulated transport device maintaining the temperature of the placenta between 20 28 C. for example by placing the placenta with clamped proximal umbilical cord in a sterile zip lock plastic bag which is then placed in an insulated container. In another embodiment the placenta is transported in a cord blood collection kit substantially as described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 230 760 filed Sep. 19 2005. Preferably the placenta is delivered to the laboratory four to twenty four hours following delivery. In certain embodiments the proximal umbilical cord is clamped preferably within 4 5 cm centimeter of the insertion into the placental disc prior to cord blood recovery. In other embodiments the proximal umbilical cord is clamped after cord blood recovery but prior to further processing of the placenta.

The placenta prior to placental stem cell collection can be stored under sterile conditions and at either room temperature or at a temperature of 5 to 25 C. centigrade . The placenta may be stored for a period of longer than forty eight hours and preferably for a period of four to twenty four hours prior to perfusing the placenta to remove any residual cord blood. The placenta is preferably stored in an anticoagulant solution at a temperature of 5 to 25 C. centigrade . Suitable anticoagulant solutions are well known in the art. For example a solution of heparin or warfarin sodium can be used. In a preferred embodiment the anticoagulant solution comprises a solution of heparin e.g. 1 w w in 1 1000 solution . The exsanguinated placenta is preferably stored for no more than 36 hours before placental cells are collected.

The mammalian placenta or a part thereof once collected and prepared generally as above can be treated in any art known manner e.g. can be perfused or disrupted e.g. digested with one or more tissue disrupting enzymes to obtain stem cells.

In one embodiment placental stem cells are collected from a mammalian placenta by physical disruption e.g. enzymatic digestion of the organ e.g. using the stem cell collection composition described in Section 5.6.1 above. For example the placenta or a portion thereof may be e.g. crushed sheared minced diced chopped macerated or the like while in contact with e.g. a buffer medium or a stem cell collection composition and the tissue subsequently digested with one or more enzymes. The placenta or a portion thereof may also be physically disrupted and digested with one or more enzymes and the resulting material then immersed in or mixed into a buffer medium or a stem cell collection composition. Any method of physical disruption can be used provided that the method of disruption leaves a plurality more preferably a majority and more preferably at least 60 70 80 90 95 98 or 99 of the cells in said organ viable as determined by e.g. trypan blue exclusion.

Typically placental cells can be obtained by disruption of a small block of placental tissue e.g. a block of placental tissue that is about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 or about 1000 cubic millimeters in volume.

Enzymatic digestion can be performed using single enzymes or combinations of enzymes. In one embodiment enzymatic digestion of placental tissue uses a combination of a matrix metalloprotease a neutral protease and a mucolytic enzyme for digestion of hyaluronic acid such as a combination of collagenase dispase and hyaluronidase or a combination of LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. and hyaluronidase. Other enzymes that can be used to disrupt placenta tissue include papain deoxyribonucleases serine proteases such as trypsin chymotrypsin or elastase. Serine proteases may be inhibited by alpha 2 microglobulin in serum and therefore the medium used for digestion is usually serum free. EDTA and DNase are commonly used in enzyme digestion procedures to increase the efficiency of cell recovery. The digestate is preferably diluted so as to avoid trapping stem cells within the viscous digest.

Typical concentrations for tissue digestion enzymes include e.g. 50 200 U mL for collagenase I and collagenase IV 1 10 U mL for dispase and 10 100 U mL for elastase. Proteases can be used in combination that is two or more proteases in the same digestion reaction or can be used sequentially in order to liberate placental cells. For example in one embodiment a placenta or part thereof is digested first with an appropriate amount of collagenase I at 2 mg ml for 30 minutes followed by digestion with trypsin 0.25 for 10 minutes at 37 C. Serine proteases are preferably used consecutively following use of other enzymes.

In another embodiment the tissue can further be disrupted by the addition of a chelator e.g. ethylene glycol bis 2 aminoethyl ether N N N N tetraacetic acid EGTA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA to the stem cell collection composition comprising the stem cells or to a solution in which the tissue is disrupted and or digested prior to isolation of the placental stem cells with the stem cell collection composition.

It will be appreciated that where an entire placenta or portion of a placenta comprising both fetal and maternal cells for example where the portion of the placenta comprises the chorion or cotyledons is digested to obtain placental stem cells the placental cells collected will comprise a mix of placental cells derived from both fetal and maternal sources. Where a portion of the placenta that comprises no or a negligible number of maternal cells for example amnion is used to obtain placental stem cells the placental stem cells collected will comprise almost exclusively fetal placental stem cells.

Placental stem cells can also be obtained by perfusion of the mammalian placenta. Methods of perfusing mammalian placenta to obtain stem cells are disclosed e.g. in Hariri U.S. Application Publication No. 2002 0123141 and in related U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 754 969 entitled Improved Composition for Collecting and Preserving Placental Cells and Methods of Using the Composition filed on Dec. 29 2005.

Placental stem cells can be collected by perfusion e.g. through the placental vasculature using e.g. a stem cell collection composition as a perfusion solution. In one embodiment a mammalian placenta is perfused by passage of perfusion solution through either or both of the umbilical artery and umbilical vein. The flow of perfusion solution through the placenta may be accomplished using e.g. gravity flow into the placenta. Preferably the perfusion solution is forced through the placenta using a pump e.g. a peristaltic pump. The umbilical vein can be e.g. cannulated with a cannula e.g. a TEFLON or plastic cannula that is connected to a sterile connection apparatus such as sterile tubing. The sterile connection apparatus is connected to a perfusion manifold.

In preparation for perfusion the placenta is preferably oriented e.g. suspended in such a manner that the umbilical artery and umbilical vein are located at the highest point of the placenta. The placenta can be perfused by passage of a perfusion fluid e.g. the stem cell collection composition provided herein through the placental vasculature or through the placental vasculature and surrounding tissue. In one embodiment the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein are connected simultaneously to a pipette that is connected via a flexible connector to a reservoir of the perfusion solution. The perfusion solution is passed into the umbilical vein and artery. The perfusion solution exudes from and or passes through the walls of the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues of the placenta and is collected in a suitable open vessel from the surface of the placenta that was attached to the uterus of the mother during gestation. The perfusion solution may also be introduced through the umbilical cord opening and allowed to flow or percolate out of openings in the wall of the placenta which interfaced with the maternal uterine wall. In another embodiment the perfusion solution is passed through the umbilical veins and collected from the umbilical artery or is passed through the umbilical artery and collected from the umbilical veins.

In one embodiment the proximal umbilical cord is clamped during perfusion and more preferably is clamped within 4 5 cm centimeter of the cord s insertion into the placental disc.

The first collection of perfusion fluid from a mammalian placenta during the exsanguination process is generally colored with residual red blood cells of the cord blood and or placental blood this portion of the perfusion can be discarded. The perfusion fluid becomes more colorless as perfusion proceeds and the residual cord blood cells are washed out of the placenta.

The volume of perfusion liquid used to collect placental stem cells may vary depending upon the number of placental stem cells to be collected the size of the placenta the number of collections to be made from a single placenta etc. In various embodiments the volume of perfusion liquid may be from 50 mL to 5000 mL 50 mL to 4000 mL 50 mL to 3000 mL 100 mL to 2000 mL 250 mL to 2000 mL 500 mL to 2000 mL or 750 mL to 2000 mL. Typically the placenta is perfused with 700 800 mL of perfusion liquid following exsanguination.

The placenta can be perfused a plurality of times over the course of several hours or several days. Where the placenta is to be perfused a plurality of times it may be maintained or cultured under aseptic conditions in a container or other suitable vessel and perfused with the stem cell collection composition or a standard perfusion solution e.g. a normal saline solution such as phosphate buffered saline PBS with or without an anticoagulant e.g. heparin warfarin sodium coumarin bishydroxycoumarin and or with or without an antimicrobial agent e.g. mercaptoethanol 0.1 mM antibiotics such as streptomycin e.g. at 40 100 g ml penicillin e.g. at 40 U ml amphotericin B e.g. at 0.5 g ml . In one embodiment an isolated placenta is maintained or cultured for a period of time without collecting the perfusate such that the placenta is maintained or cultured for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 or 24 hours or 2 or 3 or more days before perfusion and collection of perfusate. The perfused placenta can be maintained for one or more additional time s e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 or more hours and perfused a second time with e.g. 700 800 mL perfusion fluid. The placenta can be perfused 1 2 3 4 5 or more times for example once every 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 hours. In a preferred embodiment perfusion of the placenta and collection of perfusion solution e.g. stem cell collection composition is repeated until the number of recovered nucleated cells falls below 100 cells ml. The perfusates at different time points can be further processed individually to recover time dependent populations of placental stem cells. Perfusates from different time points can also be pooled.

Without wishing to be bound by any theory after exsanguination and a sufficient time of perfusion of the placenta placental stem cells are believed to migrate into the exsanguinated and perfused microcirculation of the placenta where they are collectable preferably by washing into a collecting vessel by perfusion. Perfusing the isolated placenta not only serves to remove residual cord blood but also provide the placenta with the appropriate nutrients including oxygen. The placenta may be cultivated and perfused with a similar solution which was used to remove the residual cord blood cells preferably without the addition of anticoagulant agents.

Stem cells can be isolated from placenta by perfusion with a solution comprising one or more proteases or other tissue disruptive enzymes. In a specific embodiment a placenta or portion thereof is brought to 25 37 C. and is incubated with one or more tissue disruptive enzymes in 200 mL of a culture medium for 30 minutes. Cells from the perfusate are collected brought to 4 C. and washed with a cold inhibitor mix comprising 5 mM EDTA 2 mM dithiothreitol and 2 mM beta mercaptoethanol. The placental stem cells are washed after several minutes with a cold e.g. 4 C. stem cell collection composition described elsewhere herein.

Perfusion using the pan method that is whereby perfusate is collected after it has exuded from the maternal side of the placenta results in a mix of fetal and maternal cells. As a result the cells collected by this method comprise a mixed population of placental stem cells of both fetal and maternal origin. In contrast perfusion solely through the placental vasculature whereby perfusion fluid is passed through one or two placental vessels and is collected solely through the remaining vessel s results in the collection of a population of placental stem cells almost exclusively of fetal origin.

Stem cells from mammalian placenta whether obtained by perfusion or enyzmatic digestion can initially be purified from i.e. be isolated from other cells by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Such centrifugation can follow any standard protocol for centrifugation speed etc. In one embodiment for example cells collected from the placenta are recovered from perfusate by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 minutes at room temperature which separates cells from e.g. contaminating debris and platelets. In another embodiment placental perfusate is concentrated to about 200 ml gently layered over Ficoll and centrifuged at about 1100 g for 20 minutes at 22 C. and the low density interface layer of cells is collected for further processing.

Cell pellets can be resuspended in fresh stem cell collection composition or a medium suitable for stem cell maintenance e.g. IMDM serum free medium containing 2 U ml heparin and 2 mM EDTA GibcoBRL NY . The total mononuclear cell fraction can be isolated e.g. using Lymphoprep Nycomed Pharma Oslo Norway according to the manufacturer s recommended procedure.

As used herein isolating placental stem cells means removing at least 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 of the cells with which the placental stem cells are normally associated in the intact mammalian placenta.

Placental stem cells obtained by perfusion or digestion can for example be further or initially isolated by differential trypsinization using e.g. a solution of 0.05 trypsin with 0.2 EDTA Sigma St. Louis Mo. . Differential trypsinization is possible because placental stem cells typically detach from plastic surfaces within about five minutes whereas other adherent populations typically require more than 20 30 minutes incubation. The detached placental stem cells can be harvested following trypsinization and trypsin neutralization using e.g. Trypsin Neutralizing Solution TNS Cambrex .

In one embodiment of isolation of placental stem cells aliquots of for example about 5 10 10placental cells are placed in each of several T 75 flasks preferably fibronectin coated T75 flasks. In such an embodiment the cells can be cultured with commercially available Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium MSCGM Cambrex and placed in a tissue culture incubator 37 C. 5 CO . After 10 to 15 days non adherent cells are removed from the flasks by washing with PBS. The PBS is then replaced by MSCGM. Flasks are preferably examined daily for the presence of various adherent cell types and in particular for identification and expansion of clusters of fibroblastoid cells.

The number and type of cells collected from a mammalian placenta can be monitored for example by measuring changes in morphology and cell surface markers using standard cell detection techniques such as flow cytometry cell sorting immunocytochemistry e.g. staining with tissue specific or cell marker specific antibodies fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS magnetic activated cell sorting MACS by examination of the morphology of cells using light or confocal microscopy and or by measuring changes in gene expression using techniques well known in the art such as PCR and gene expression profiling. These techniques can be used too to identify cells that are positive for one or more particular markers. For example using antibodies to CD34 one can determine using the techniques above whether a cell comprises a detectable amount of CD34 as compared to for example an isotype control if so the cell is CD34. Likewise if a cell produces enough OCT 4 RNA to be detectable by RT PCR or significantly more OCT 4 RNA than a terminally differentiated cell the cell is OCT 4. Antibodies to cell surface markers e.g. CD markers such as CD34 and the sequence of stem cell specific genes such as OCT 4 are well known in the art.

Placental cells particularly cells that have been isolated by Ficoll separation differential adherence or a combination of both may be sorted e.g. further isolated using a fluorescence activated cell sorter FACS . Fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS is a well known method for separating particles including cells based on the fluorescent properties of the particles Kamarch 1987 Methods Enzymol 151 150 165 . Laser excitation of fluorescent moieties in the individual particles results in a small electrical charge allowing electromagnetic separation of positive and negative particles from a mixture. In one embodiment cell surface marker specific antibodies or ligands are labeled with distinct fluorescent labels. Cells are processed through the cell sorter allowing separation of cells based on their ability to bind to the antibodies used. FACS sorted particles may be directly deposited into individual wells of 96 well or 384 well plates to facilitate separation and cloning.

In one sorting scheme placental stem cells can be sorted on the basis of expression of the markers CD34 CD38 CD44 CD45 CD73 CD105 OCT 4 and or HLA G or any of the other markers listed elsewhere herein. This can be accomplished in connection with procedures to select stem cells on the basis of their adherence properties in culture. For example adherence selection of placental stem cells can be accomplished before or after sorting on the basis of marker expression. In one embodiment for example placental stem cells can be sorted first on the basis of their expression of CD34 CD34 cells are retained and cells that are CD200 or HLA G are separated from all other CD34 cells. In another embodiment placental stem cells can be sorted based on their expression of CD200 and or HLA G or lack thereof for example cells displaying either of these markers can be isolated for further use. Cells that express e.g. CD200 and or HLA G can in a specific embodiment be further sorted based on their expression of CD73 and or CD105 or epitopes recognized by antibodies SH2 SH3 or SH4 or lack of expression of CD34 CD38 or CD45. For example in one embodiment placental stem cells are sorted by expression or lack thereof of CD200 HLA G CD73 CD105 CD34 CD38 and CD45 and placental stem cells that are CD200 HLA G CD73 CD105 CD34 CD38 and CD45 are isolated from other placental cells for further use.

In another embodiment magnetic beads can be used to separate cells e.g. separate placental stem cells from other placental cells. The cells may be sorted using a magnetic activated cell sorting MACS technique a method for separating particles based on their ability to bind magnetic beads 0.5 100 m diameter . A variety of useful modifications can be performed on the magnetic microspheres including covalent addition of antibody that specifically recognizes a particular cell surface molecule or hapten. The beads are then mixed with the cells to allow binding. Cells are then passed through a magnetic field to separate out cells having the specific cell surface marker. In one embodiment these cells can then isolated and re mixed with magnetic beads coupled to an antibody against additional cell surface markers. The cells are again passed through a magnetic field isolating cells that bound both the antibodies. Such cells can then be diluted into separate dishes such as microtiter dishes for clonal isolation.

Placental stem cells can also be characterized and or sorted based on cell morphology and growth characteristics. For example placental stem cells can be characterized as having and or selected on the basis of e.g. a fibroblastoid appearance in culture. Placental stem cells can also be characterized as having and or be selected on the basis of their ability to form embryoid like bodies. In one embodiment for example placental cells that are fibroblastoid in shape express CD73 and CD105 and produce one or more embryoid like bodies in culture can be isolated from other placental cells. In another embodiment OCT 4 placental cells that produce one or more embryoid like bodies in culture are isolated from other placental cells.

In another embodiment placental stem cells can be identified and characterized by a colony forming unit assay. Colony forming unit assays are commonly known in the art such as MESENCULT medium Stem Cell Technologies Inc. Vancouver British Columbia .

Placental stem cells can be assessed for viability proliferation potential and longevity using standard techniques known in the art such as trypan blue exclusion assay fluorescein diacetate uptake assay propidium iodide uptake assay to assess viability and thymidine uptake assay MTT cell proliferation assay to assess proliferation . Longevity may be determined by methods well known in the art such as by determining the maximum number of population doubling in an extended culture.

Placental stem cells can also be separated from other placental cells using other techniques known in the art e.g. selective growth of desired cells positive selection selective destruction of unwanted cells negative selection separation based upon differential cell agglutinability in the mixed population as for example with soybean agglutinin freeze thaw procedures filtration conventional and zonal centrifugation centrifugal elutriation counter streaming centrifugation unit gravity separation countercurrent distribution electrophoresis and the like.

Isolated placental stem cells or placental cell populations or cells or placental tissue from which placental cells grow out can be used to initiate or seed cell cultures.

Once placental stem cells are isolated e.g. separated from at least 50 of the placental cells with which the stem cell or population of stem cells is normally associated in vivo the stem cell or population of stem cells can be proliferated and expanded in vitro. Similarly once placental stem cells are produced such cells can also be proliferated and expanded in vitro.

Once 70 90 confluence is obtained the placental stem cells may be passaged. For example the cells can be enzymatically treated e.g. trypsinized using techniques well known in the art to separate them from the tissue culture surface. After removing the placental stem cells by pipetting and counting the cells about 20 000 100 000 stem cells preferably about 50 000 placental stem cells are passaged to a new culture container containing fresh culture medium. Typically the new medium is the same type of medium from which the stem cells were removed.

Placental cells provided herein can be suspended in a hydrogel solution suitable for e.g. injection. Suitable hydrogels for such compositions include self assembling peptides such as RAD16. Placental stem cells can also be combined with e.g. alginate or platelet rich plasma or other fibrin containing matrices for local injection. In one embodiment a hydrogel solution comprising placental stem cells can be allowed to harden for instance in a mold to form a matrix having the cells dispersed therein for implantation. Placental stem cells in such a matrix can also be cultured so that the cells are mitotically expanded prior to implantation. The hydrogel can be e.g. an organic polymer natural or synthetic that is cross linked via covalent ionic or hydrogen bonds to create a three dimensional open lattice structure that entraps water molecules to form a gel. Hydrogel forming materials include polysaccharides such as alginate and salts thereof peptides polyphosphazines and polyacrylates which are crosslinked ionically or block polymers such as polyethylene oxide polypropylene glycol block copolymers which are crosslinked by temperature or pH respectively. In some embodiments the hydrogel or matrix is biodegradable.

In some embodiments the matrix comprises an in situ polymerizable gel see. e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication 2002 0022676 Anseth et al. 78 1 3 199 209 2002 Wang et al. 24 22 3969 80 2003 .

The placental stem cells can be seeded onto a three dimensional framework or scaffold and implanted in vivo. Such a framework can be implanted in combination with any one or more growth factors cells drugs or other components that stimulate tissue formation or otherwise enhance or improve the practice of the methods of treatment described elsewhere herein.

Examples of scaffolds that can be used in the methods of treatment described herein include nonwoven mats porous foams or self assembling peptides. Nonwoven mats can be formed using fibers comprised of a synthetic absorbable copolymer of glycolic and lactic acids e.g. PGA PLA VICRYL Ethicon Inc. Somerville N.J. . Foams composed of e.g. poly caprolactone poly glycolic acid PCL PGA copolymer formed by processes such as freeze drying or lyophilization see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 355 699 can also be used as scaffolds.

In another embodiment the scaffold is or comprises a nanofibrous scaffold e.g. an electrospun nanofibrous scaffold. In a more specific embodiment said nanofibrous scaffold comprises poly L lactic acid PLLA type I collagen a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene PVDF TrFE poly caprolactone poly L lactide co caprolactone P LLA CL e.g. 75 25 and or a copolymer of poly 3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate PHBV and type I collagen. Methods of producing nanofibrous scaffolds e.g. electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds are known in the art. See e.g. Xu et al. 10 7 1160 1168 2004 Xu et al. 25 877 886 20040 Meng et al. 18 1 81 94 2007 .

The placental stem cells described herein can also be seeded onto or contacted with a physiologically acceptable ceramic material including but not limited to mono di tri alpha tri beta tri and tetra calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite fluoroapatites calcium sulfates calcium fluorides calcium oxides calcium carbonates magnesium calcium phosphates biologically active glasses such as BIOGLASS and mixtures thereof. Porous biocompatible ceramic materials currently commercially available include SURGIBONE CanMedica Corp.

Raynham Mass. and VITOSS RHAKOSS and CORTOSS Orthovita Malvern Pa. . The framework can be a mixture blend or composite of natural and or synthetic materials.

In another embodiment placental stem cells can be seeded onto or contacted with a felt which can be e.g. composed of a multifilament yarn made from a bioabsorbable material such as PGA PLA PCL copolymers or blends or hyaluronic acid.

The placental stem cells described herein can in another embodiment be seeded onto foam scaffolds that may be composite structures. Such foam scaffolds can be molded into a useful shape. In some embodiments the framework is treated e.g. with 0.1M acetic acid followed by incubation in polylysine PBS and or collagen prior to inoculation of the placental cells in order to enhance cell attachment. External surfaces of a matrix may be modified to improve the attachment or growth of cells and differentiation of tissue such as by plasma coating the matrix or addition of one or more proteins e.g. collagens elastic fibers reticular fibers glycoproteins glycosaminoglycans e.g. heparin sulfate chondroitin 4 sulfate chondroitin 6 sulfate dermatan sulfate keratin sulfate etc. a cellular matrix and or other materials such as but not limited to gelatin alginates agar agarose and plant gums and the like.

In some embodiments the scaffold comprises or is treated with materials that render it non thrombogenic. These treatments and materials may also promote and sustain endothelial growth migration and extracellular matrix deposition. Examples of these materials and treatments include but are not limited to natural materials such as basement membrane proteins such as laminin and Type IV collagen synthetic materials such as EPTFE and segmented polyurethaneurea silicones such as PURSPAN The Polymer Technology Group Inc. Berkeley Calif. . The scaffold can also comprise anti thrombotic agents such as heparin the scaffolds can also be treated to alter the surface charge e.g. coating with plasma prior to seeding with placental stem cells.

In another aspect provided herein are placental cells that are genetically modified e.g. to produce a nucleic acid or polypeptide of interest. Genetic modification can be accomplished e.g. using virus based vectors including but not limited to non integrating replicating vectors e.g. papilloma virus vectors SV40 vectors adenoviral vectors integrating viral vectors e.g. retrovirus vector or adeno associated viral vectors or replication defective viral vectors. Other methods of introducing DNA into cells include the use of liposomes electroporation a particle gun direct DNA injection or the like.

Stem cells can be e.g. transformed or transfected with DNA controlled by or in operative association with one or more appropriate expression control elements for example promoter or enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites internal ribosomal entry sites. Preferably such a DNA incorporates a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered stem cells can be e.g. grown in enriched media and then switched to selective media. In one embodiment the DNA used to engineer a placental cell comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest e.g. a cytokine growth factor differentiation agent or therapeutic polypeptide.

The DNA used to engineer the stem cell can comprise any promoter known in the art to drive expression of a nucleotide sequence in mammalian cells e.g. human cells. For example promoters include but are not limited to CMV promoter enhancer SV40 promoter papillomavirus promoter Epstein Barr virus promoter elastin gene promoter and the like. In a specific embodiment the promoter is regulatable so that the nucleotide sequence is expressed only when desired. Promoters can be either inducible e.g. those associated with metallothionein and heat shock proteins or constitutive.

In another specific embodiment the promoter is tissue specific or exhibits tissue specificity. Examples of such promoters include but are not limited to myelin basic protein gene control region Readhead et al. 198748 703 oligodendrocyte cells elastase I gene control region Swit et al. 198438 639 Ornitz et al. 198650 399 MacDonald 19877 425 pancreatic acinar cells insulin gene control region Hanahan 1985315 115 pancreatic beta cells myosin light chain 2 gene control region Shani 1985314 283 skeletal muscle .

Placental cells may be engineered to knock out or knock down expression of one or more genes. The expression of a gene native to a cell can be diminished by for example inhibition of expression by inactivating the gene completely by e.g. homologous recombination. In one embodiment for example an exon encoding an important region of the protein or an exon 5 to that region is interrupted by a positive selectable marker e.g. neo preventing the production of normal mRNA from the target gene and resulting in inactivation of the gene. A gene may also be inactivated by creating a deletion in part of a gene or by deleting the entire gene. By using a construct with two regions of homology to the target gene that are far apart in the genome the sequences intervening the two regions can be deleted Mombaerts et al. 199188 3084 . Antisense DNAzymes small interfering RNA and ribozyme molecules that inhibit expression of the target gene can also be used to reduce the level of target gene activity in the stem cells. For example antisense RNA molecules which inhibit the expression of major histocompatibility gene complexes HLA have been shown to be most versatile with respect to immune responses. Triple helix molecules can be utilized in reducing the level of target gene activity. See e.g. L. G. Davis et al. eds 1994 BASIC METHODS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 2nd ed. Appleton Lange Norwalk Conn. which is incorporated herein by reference.

In a specific embodiment placental cells can be genetically modified with a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest wherein expression of the polypeptide of interest is controllable by an exogenous factor e.g. polypeptide small organic molecule or the like. Such a polypeptide can be a therapeutic polypeptide. In a more specific embodiment the polypeptide of interest is IL 12 or interleukin 1 receptor antagonist IL 1Ra . In another more specific embodiment the polypeptide of interest is a fusion of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist and dihydrofolate reductase DHFR and the exogenous factor is an antifolate e.g. methotrexate. Such a construct is useful in the engineering of placental cells that express IL 1Ra or a fusion of IL 1Ra and DHFR upon contact with methotrexate. Such a construct can be used e.g. in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In this embodiment the fusion of IL 1Ra and DHFR is translationally upregulated upon exposure to an antifolate such as methotrexate. Therefore in another specific embodiment the nucleic acid used to genetically engineer a placental cell can comprise nucleotide sequences encoding a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide wherein said first and second polypeptides are expressed as a fusion protein that is translationally upregulated in the presence of an exogenous factor. The polypeptide can be expressed transiently or long term e.g. over the course of weeks or months .

Such a nucleic acid molecule can additionally comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide that allows for positive selection of engineered stem cells or allows for visualization of the engineered stem cells. In another more specific embodiment the nucleotide sequence encodes a polypeptide that is e.g. fluorescent under appropriate visualization conditions e.g. luciferase Luc . In a more specific embodiment such a nucleic acid molecule can comprise IL 1Ra DHFR IRES Luc where IRES is an internal ribosomal entry site.

Placental stem cells can be conditionally immortalized by transfection with a vector containing a growth promoting gene that is a gene encoding a protein that under appropriate conditions promotes growth of the placental stem cells such that the production and or activity of the growth promoting protein is regulatable by an external factor. In a preferred embodiment the growth promoting gene is an oncogene such as but not limited to v myc N myc c myc p53 SV40 large T antigen polyoma large T antigen E1a adenovirus or E7 protein of human papillomavirus.

External regulation of the growth promoting protein can be achieved by placing the growth promoting gene under the control of an externally regulatable promoter e.g. a promoter the activity of which can be controlled by for example contacting the cells with a compound to which the promoter is responsive. In one embodiment a tetracycline tet controlled gene expression system can be employed see Gossen et al. 89 5547 5551 1992 Hoshimaru et al. 93 1518 1523 1996 . In the absence of tet a tet controlled transactivator tTA within this vector strongly activates transcription from ph a minimal promoter from human cytomegalovirus fused to tet operator sequences. tTA is a fusion protein of the repressor tetR of the transposon 10 derived tet resistance operon of and the acidic domain of VP 16 of herpes simplex virus. Low non toxic concentrations of tet e.g. 0.01 1.0 g mL almost completely abolish transactivation by tTA.

In one embodiment the vector further contains a gene encoding a selectable marker e.g. a protein that confers drug resistance. The bacterial neomycin resistance gene neo is one such marker that may be employed within the methods described herein. Cells carrying neomay be selected by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as the addition of e.g. 100 200 g mL G418 to the growth medium.

Transfection can be achieved by any of a variety of means known to those of ordinary skill in the art including but not limited to retroviral infection. In general a cell culture may be transfected by incubation with a mixture of conditioned medium collected from the producer cell line for the vector and DMEM F12 containing N2 supplements. For example a placental cell culture prepared as described above may be infected after e.g. five days in vitro by incubation for about 20 hours in one volume of conditioned medium and two volumes of DMEM F12 containing N2 supplements. Transfected cells carrying a selectable marker may then be selected as described above.

Following transfection cultures are passaged onto a surface that permits proliferation e.g. allows at least 30 of the cells to double in a 24 hour period. Preferably the substrate is a polyornithine laminin substrate consisting of tissue culture plastic coated with polyornithine 10 g mL and or laminin 10 g mL a polylysine laminin substrate or a surface treated with fibronectin. Cultures are then fed every 3 4 days with growth medium which may or may not be supplemented with one or more proliferation enhancing factors. Proliferation enhancing factors may be added to the growth medium when cultures are less than 50 confluent.

The conditionally immortalized placental stem cell lines can be passaged using standard techniques such as by trypsinization when 80 95 confluent. Up to approximately the twentieth passage it is in some embodiments beneficial to maintain selection by for example the addition of G418 for cells containing a neomycin resistance gene . Cells may also be frozen in liquid nitrogen for long term storage.

Clonal cell lines can be isolated from a conditionally immortalized human placental stem cell line prepared as described above. In general such clonal cell lines may be isolated using standard techniques such as by limit dilution or using cloning rings and expanded. Clonal cell lines may generally be fed and passaged as described above.

Conditionally immortalized human placental stem cell lines which may but need not be clonal may generally be induced to differentiate by suppressing the production and or activity of the growth promoting protein under culture conditions that facilitate differentiation. For example if the gene encoding the growth promoting protein is under the control of an externally regulatable promoter the conditions e.g. temperature or composition of medium may be modified to suppress transcription of the growth promoting gene. For the tetracycline controlled gene expression system discussed above differentiation can be achieved by the addition of tetracycline to suppress transcription of the growth promoting gene. In general 1 g mL tetracycline for 4 5 days is sufficient to initiate differentiation. To promote further differentiation additional agents may be included in the growth medium.

This Example demonstrates that CD10 CD34 CD105 CD200 placental stem cells PDAC are effective at reducing neuropathic pain.

A rat neuropathic pain model was used. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 175 200 g were divided into three groups of experimental animals which received 1 10 3 10 or 1 10PDAC intravenously. Negative control animals received only vehicle. Positive control animals received either 50 mg kg or 100 mg kg gabapentin a pain reducer on Day 11 14 18 21 25 28 and 35 post surgery.

Surgical Procedure On Day 0 D0 anesthesia was induced by IP injection of Ketamine 85 mg kg xylazine 5 mg kg mix. Left paraspinal muscles of the rats were separated from the spinous processes from L4 to S2. The L6 transverse process was carefully removed with a small rongeur to identify visually L4 L6 spinal nerves. The left L5 L6 spinal nerves were isolated and tightly ligated with 5 0 silk thread. Animals were then allowed to recuperate.

On D7 pain sensitivity for all groups was assessed as a baseline. Pain sensitivity was assessed again for all animals at D11 D14 D18 D21 D25 D28 and D35.

Before the pain inflicting procedure on D 1 each rat was placed inside a Plexiglas chamber for 10 15 minute acclimation period. The rats were evaluated for sensitivity to a Von Frey Filament Assortment ranging from the thinnest 8 g filament up to the thickest 15 g filament 8 10 15 g as follows. An individual von Frey filament was applied to the test animal from the bottom direction and up and pin point touching the middle of each paw facing down of the rat s hind legs either five consecutive times or until a response occurred. The test was repeated with each of the different chosen filaments with a minimum 90 seconds interval. If the rat lifted its paw at least 3 times in a session it was considered as the minimum pain sensitivity level.

Treatment with gabapentin and testing of all animals were performed on days 11 14 17 21 24 and 28 post surgery. Gabapentin receiving animals were treated on each test day and tested two hours after each dosing at approximately the same time of day. Animals that on day 7 8 demonstrated motor deficits evident by lack of muscle tone in either hind limbs or lack of withdrawal reflex were excluded from the study

To assess pain sensitivity during the experiment the rats were placed inside the Plexiglas chamber for a 15 20 minute acclimation period. Subsequently the rats were evaluated for tactile allodynia pain from stimuli that are not normally painful using a von Frey Filament ranging from the thinnest 0.6 g filament up to the thickest 15 g 0.6 1.4 2 4 6 8 10 15 g as above for establishing the baseline pain threshold except that initially the thinnest von Frey filament was touched to the hind paw 5 consecutive times or until a response occurred. If no response occurred the next thickest filament was applied in the same manner repeating until a withdrawal response was obtained. Once a withdrawal response was obtained the paw was retested with the preceding descending filament s until no response was observed. The interval between successive filaments was held to no more than approximately 90 seconds. Each animal had both hind paws tested in this manner first the right leg the injected leg and then the left leg. The lowest amount of force required to elicit a response is recorded as withdrawal threshold in grams.

Gabapentin GBP was administered intraperitoneally IP on each testing day D11 D14 D17 D21 D24 D28 and D35 . PDAC were administered intravenously IV on day 7 or 8.

Administration of PDAC at the 10 10dosage level significantly improved sensitivity scores in the assay as compared to vehicle treated animals particularly on D21 D28 and D35 that is the animals displayed reduced allodynia. See . Results for this dosage were comparable to 50 mg kg GBP. An aggregate pain relief score termed TOPAR Total PAin Relief was calculated as an Area Under the Curve AUC of reduction in mechanical sensitivity following treatment. This analysis confirms that PDAC significantly improved pain sensitivity scores. See . Thus these analyses confirm that PDAC can be used to treat pain.

This Example describes studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of CD10 CD34 CD105 CD200 placental stem cells PDAC in the treatment of cancer pain and inflammatory pain.

Five week old immunocompromised male mice CB17 SCRF Taconic Laboratories housed in a germ free barrier are used. At 6 weeks of age baseline measurements for mechanical and thermal sensitivities are performed. On the following day the mice are anesthetized with 100 mg kg ketamine and 20 mg kg xylazine and inoculated in the left cardiac ventricle with 5 10PC3 ML cells in 100 L serum free DMEM F12. This procedure consistently produces skeletal tumors in tibiae and femora of 80 of inoculated mice however PC3 ML cells do not metastasize to any soft tissue organ with the exception of small tumors produced in the adrenal glands. The PC3 ML cells are engineered to stably express a bright variant of Green Fluorescent Protein eGFP allowing visualization of the dissemination of the cells to the skeleton by fluorescence microscopy.

Initially mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities are measured on days 1 4 7 10 14 21 and 28 post PC13 ML cell inoculation to determine a time course of the development and persistence of pain. Once the onset of quantifiable and statistically significant changes in pain sensitivity has been identified the effects of the placental stem cells are examined. Placental stem cells are administered following the onset of pain with periodic pain assessments made during the study period. PDAC are administered to experimental mice at doses of e.g. 0.1 10cells 0.6 10cells and 1.5 10cells per dose . Control animals receive only vehicle. Thus for example if statistically significant changes in pain sensitivity occur on average on day 12 post inoculation PDAC at one of the three dosages are administered on that day prior to pain testing and pain assessments are made on days 13 16 23 and 30. Optionally the study includes a second administration of PDAC if there is an initial attenuation in pain hypersensitivity followed by a recurrence.

Mice not demonstrating changes in pain sensitivity in the first phase of the study that is administration of PDAC following the development of pain are excluded from the study.

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of CD10 CD34 CD105 CD200 placental stem cells against neuropathic pain induced by paclitaxel. In the study mice C57BL 6J are injected with paclitaxel as the chemotherapeutic agent. Paclitaxel has been demonstrated to produce neuropathic pain in both humans and animals see e.g. Authier et al. Animal models of chemotherapy evoked painful peripheral neuropathies 6 620 629 2009 Gauchan et. al. 2009 Golden and Johnson 2004 .

Baseline sensitivities in mice are determined prior to administration of paclitaxel. Mice are then administered a dose of paclitaxel 5 mg kg i.p. and mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities are measured on 1 4 7 10 and 14 days. Pain sensitivities typically peak at 14 days in this model and persist up to 35 days. PDAC are administered to experimental mice at doses of e.g. 0.1 10cells 0.6 10cells and 1.5 10cells per dose on day 14 prior to testing. Control animals receive only vehicle. Pain sensitivity assessments for all animals are made on days 15 21 28 and 35. Positive control animals receive either gabapentin or morphine administered at effective doses.

This study demonstrates effectiveness of CD10 CD34 CD105 CD200 placental stem cells against pain in an inflammatory pain model.

Mice C57BL 6J receive a 20 L subcutaneous injection of an inflammatory dose of Complete Freund s Adjuvant CFA 50 dissolved in saline in the plantar surface of the hindpaw. Pain sensitivities typically peak at 3 hours after CFA injection and can persist up to 14 days. PDAC are administered to experimental mice at doses of e.g. 0.1 10cells 0.6 10cells and 1.5 10cells per dose 3 hours after CFA administration. Positive control mice are administered a pain reducing effective dose of a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug e.g. celecoxib CELEBREX . Mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities are then measured on days 1 3 7 and 14.

For each of the pain studies above mechanical allodynia are assessed using von Frey filaments as described in Example 1 above. Thermal sensitivity is assessed using the Hargreaves Procedure. The Hargreaves assay measures nociceptive sensitivity in a freely moving animal by focusing a radiant heat source on the plantar surface of an animal s hindpaw as it stands in a Plexiglas chamber and measuring latency to withdraw its paw from the heat. Cold sensitivity will be assessed using acetone in this method a drop of acetone is applied to a hind paw followed by evaporation and measuring latency to withdrawal of the paw from a surface.

In each of the studies the PDAC are administered IV into the tail vein. Control vehicle in each study is 5 dextran 40 in saline buffer.

An individual presents with neuropathic pain in the extremities related to administration of paclitaxel. The attending oncologist indicates that maintenance of paclitaxel therapy is strongly indicated.

This example describes a study using a rat neuritis model to evaluate the effect of CD34 CD10 CD105 CD200 placental stem cells PDAC on neuropathic pain and to assess potential ex vivo changes that may mediate the cells effects. The neuritis model is an established model for neuropathic pain driven by perineural inflammation. In this model perineural inflammation is induced in the sciatic nerve vicinity of rats. Pain develops in the nerve target organ hind paw within 2 3 days and resolves within approximately 8 days.

Three month old male Sprague Dawley rats initially weighing approximately 250 300 g were used. Four groups were included in the study 0.4 1 or 4 million of PDAC and the vehicle control. The minimum and maximum weights of the rats were within the range of 20 .

While under surgical anesthesia 50 mg kg ketamine and 7.5 mg kg xylazine injected IM the common sciatic nerve of the rats was exposed at mid thigh and wrapped with sterile biocompatible carrier soaked with 200 l of 1 lambda carrageenan Sigma Aldrich CAS Number 9064 57 7 . Three days following surgery animals were assessed for mechanical hypersensitivity as an indirect measure of pain in the hind paws. Tactile allodynia was measured by assessing the withdrawal response to calibrated von Frey fibers. Three fibers according to force application low 8 g medium 16 g and high force fiber 26 g were employed in this study. Each fiber was applied to the plantar surface of both hind paws 5 times and percent response was calculated.

On Day 4 following the perineural inflammation induction animals were treated with PDAC at the dose of 0.4 1 or 4 million or vehicle immediately following the assessment of allodynia. The treatment was provided intravenously through the tail vein. At various time points after treatment animals were assessed for mechanical allodynia by applying the same procedure as on Day 3 post surgery. Pain levels were assessed on days 0 3 4 6 and 8. Tissue samples including sciatic nerve draining lymph node and plasma were analyzed.

The results demonstrated that PDAC at the dose of 4 million and 1 million reduced the pain significantly compared to the vehicle group on Days 4 6 and 8 while PDAC at 0.4 million showed a trend of pain reduction on Day 4. Ex vivo tissue analyses demonstrated that PDAC suppressed T cell priming and activation in draining lymph node by suppressing activation of antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells and macrophage. PDAC reduced interferon gamma IL 17 while increased IL 10 production in draining lymph node as well as ipsi lateral sciatic nerve suggesting that PDAC modulates T cell differentiation. Furthermore in ipsi lateral sciatic nerve significantly less leukocyte infiltration was observed in PDAC treated animals.

Placental tissue is dissected and digested followed by primary and expansion cultures to achieve an expanded cell product that produces many cell doses. Cells are stored in a two tiered cell bank and are distributed as a frozen cell product. All cell doses derived from a single donor placenta are defined as a lot and one placenta lot is processed at a time using sterile technique in a dedicated room and Class 100 laminar flow hood. The cell product is defined as being CD105 CD200 CD10 and CD34 having a normal karyotype and no or substantially no maternal cell content.

A placenta is obtained less than 24 hours after expulsion. Placental tissue is obtained from amnion a combination of amnion and chorion or chorion. The tissue is minced into small pieces about 1 mm in size. Minced tissue is digested in 1 mg ml Collagenase 1A for 1 hour at 37 C. followed by Trypsin EDTA for 30 minutes at 37 C. After three washes in 5 FBS in PBS the tissue is resuspended in culture medium.

The digested tissue is suspended in culture medium and placed into Corning T flasks which are incubated in a humidified chamber maintained at 37 C. with 5 CO. Half of the medium is replenished after 5 days of culture. High density colonies of cells form by 2 weeks of culture. Colonies are harvested with Trypsin EDTA which is then quenched with 2 FBS in PBS. Cells are centrifuged and resuspended in culture medium for seeding expansion cultures. These cells are defined as Passage 0 cells having doubled 0 times.

Cells harvested from primary culture harvested from expansion culture or thawed from the cell bank are used to seed expansion cultures. Cell Factories NUNC are treated with 5 COin air at 50 ml min tray for 10 min through a sterile filter and warmed in a humidified incubator maintained at 37 C. with 5 CO. Cell seeds are counted on a hemacytometer with trypan blue and cell number viability passage number and the cumulative number of doublings are recorded. Cells are suspended in culture medium to about 2.3 10cells ml and 110 ml tray are seeded in the Cell Factories. After 3 4 days and again at 5 6 days of culture culture medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium followed by another treatment with 5 COin air. When cells reach approximately 10cells cm cells are harvested with Trypsin EDTA followed by quenching with 2 FBS in PBS. Cells are then centrifuged and resuspended in culture medium.

Cells to be frozen down are harvested from culture with Trypsin EDTA quenched with 2 FBS in PBS and counted on a hemacytometer. After centrifugation cells are resuspended with 10 DMSO in FBS to a concentration of about 1 million cells ml for cells to be used for assembly of a cell bank and 10 million cells ml for individual frozen cell doses. The cell solution is transferred to a freezing container which is placed in an isopropyl alcohol bath in a 80 C. freezer. The following day cells are transferred to liquid nitrogen.

Gene expression patterns from placental stem cells as prepared in Example 7 from amnion chorion AC and umbilical cord UC were compared to gene expression patterns of multipotent bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells BM and dermal fibroblasts DF the latter of which is considered to be terminally differentiated. Cells were grown for a single passage an intermediate number of passages and a large number of passages including until senescence . Results indicate that the number of population doublings has a major impact on gene expression. A set of genes was identified that are up regulated in AC and UC and either down regulated or absent in BM and DF and that are expressed independent of passage number. Placental stem cells and umbilical cord stem cells will be referred to collectively hereinafter in this Example as AC UC stem cells.

BM Cat PT 2501 and DF Cat CC 2511 were purchased from Cambrex. AC and UC originated from passage 0 tissue culture flasks. AC and UC in the flasks were obtained by digestion from a donor placenta. T 75 culture flasks were seeded at 6000 cells cmand cells were passaged when they became confluent. Population doublings were estimated from trypan blue cell counts. Cultures were assayed for gene expression after 3 11 14 and 24 38 population doublings.

Cells were lysed directly in their tissue culture flasks with the exception of one culture that was trypsinized prior to lysis. Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy kit from QIAGEN. RNA integrity and concentrations were determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Ten micrograms of total RNA from each culture were hybridized on an Affymetrix GENECHIP platform. Total RNA was converted to labeled cRNAs and hybridized to oligonucleotide Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays according to the manufacture s methods. Image files were processed with the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software and normalized and analyzed with Agilent GeneSpring 7.3 software.

To establish a gene expression pattern unique to AC UC stem cells two stem cell lines AC 6 and UC 6 were cultured in parallel with BM MSC and DF. To maximize identifying a gene expression profile attributable to cellular origin and minimize exogenous influences all cells were grown in the same medium seeded and sub cultured using the same criteria. Cells were harvested after 3 population doublings 11 14 doublings or 35 doublings or senescence whichever came first. Genes whose expression in AC UC stem cells are unchanged by time in culture and are up regulated relative to BM and DF are candidates for AC UC stem cell specific genes.

Samples BM AC 6 and UC 6 were collected and harvested after three population doublings these samples were regarded as being in culture for a short period of time. A short term DF sample was not collected. Intermediate length cultures 11 to 14 doublings were collected for all cell types. Long term cultures were collected from all cell lines at about 35 population doublings or just prior to senescence whichever came first. Senescence occurred before 15 doublings for BM and at 25 doublings for DF. The purchased BM and DF cells were expanded many times prior to gene analysis and cannot be considered early stage. However operationally BM grown for three doublings BM 03 are deemed a short term culture. Likewise BM 11 is operationally referred to as an intermediate length culture but because senescence occurred at 14 doublings BM 11 is most likely a long term culture biologically.

Microarray analysis identifies patterns of gene expression and hierarchical clustering HC attempts to find similarities in the context of two dimensions genes in the first dimension and different conditions different RNA samples in the second. The GeneChips used in this experiment contained over 22 000 probe sets referred to as the all genes list but many of these sets interrogate genes that are not expressed in any condition. To reduce the all genes list genes not expressed or expressed at low levels raw values below 250 in all samples were eliminated to yield a list of 8 215 genes.

Genes that remain constant across all AC UC samples and are down regulated in BM and DF are considered AC UC stem cell specific. Two filtering methods were combined to create a list of 58 AC UC stem cell specific genes Table 2 .

First 58 genes were identified by selecting those genes over expressed three fold in at least seven of eight AC UC stem cell conditions relative to all BM and DF samples. Filtering on eight of the eight AC UC stem cell conditions yielded a similar list. The second filtering method used absent and present calls provided by the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software. A list was created by identifying genes absent in all BM and DF conditions and present in AC 03 AC 11 UC 03 and UC 11. Gene calls in the later AC UC stem cell conditions were not stipulated.

The two lists overlapped significantly and were combined. The combined list was trimmed further by eliminating 1 several genes expressed at very low levels in most or all AC UC stem cell conditions and 2 genes carried on the Y chromosome. AC and UC cells used in this study were confirmed to be male by FISH analysis and the BM and DF were derived from a female donor. The resulting list of 46 AC UC stem cell specific genes is shown in Table 3.

This list of 46 genes encodes a collection of proteins presenting a number of ontology groups. The most highly represented group cell adhesion contains eight genes. No genes encode proteins involved in DNA replication or cell division. Sixteen genes with specific references to epithelia are also listed.

An expression pattern specific to placental stem cells and distinguishable from bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells was identified. Operationally this pattern includes 46 genes that are over expressed in all placental stem cell samples relative to all BM and DF samples.

The experimental design compared cells cultured for short medium and long periods of time in culture. For AC and UC cells each culture period has a characteristic set of differentially expressed genes. During the short term or early phase AC 03 and UC 03 two hundred up regulated genes regress to the mean after eight population doublings.

Gene expression by the intermediate length cultures is defined by rapid cell division and genes differentially expressed at this time are quite different from those differentially expressed during the early phase. Many of the genes up regulated in AC 11 and UC 11 along with BM 03 and DF 14 are involved in chromosome replication and cell division. Based on gene expression BM 03 appears biologically to be a mid term culture. In this middle stage cell type specific gene expression is overshadowed by cellular proliferation. In addition almost every gene over expressed in the short term AC or UC cultures is down regulated in the middle and later stage conditions. 143 genes were up regulated five fold during this highly proliferative phase constituting approximately 1.7 of the expressed genes.

The long term cultures represent the final or senescent phase. In this phase cells have exhausted their ability to divide and especially for AC and UC the absolute number of differentially expressed genes is noticeably reduced. This may be the result of cells being fully adapted to their culture environment and a consequently reduced burden to biosynthesize. Surprisingly late BM and DF cultures do not display this same behavior a large number of genes are differentially expressed in BM 11 and DF 24 relative to AC and UC and the normalized value of 1. AC and UC are distinguishable from BM and DF most notably in the long term cultures.

The placental stem cell specific gene list described here is diverse. COL4A1 and COL4A2 are coordinately regulated and KRT18 and KRT8 also appear to be co expressed. Eight of the genes encode proteins involved in cell to cell contact three of which DSC3 DSG2 and PKP2 are localized to desmosomes intercellular contact points anchored to intermediate filament cytoskeleton proteins such as keratin 18 and keratin 8. Tight cell to cell contact is characteristic of epithelial and endothelial cells and not typically associated with fibroblasts. Table 3 lists 16 genes of the 46 total characteristic to epithelial cells. Placental stem cells are generally described as fibroblast like small spindle shaped cells. This morphology is typically distinct from BM and DF especially at lower cell densities. Also of note is the expression pattern of CD200 which is present in AC UC stem cell and absent in all BM and DF samples.

This subset of genes of 46 genes constitutes a set of molecular biomarkers that distinguishes AC UC stem cells from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells or fibroblasts.

This example demonstrates that placental stem cells reduce neuro inflammatory pain via a mechanism that potentially comprises suppression of dendritic cell homing activation and differentiation induction of IL 10 and T cell modulation.

Studies were performed using male Sprague Dawley rats 3 months old approximately 250 300 g at study initiation the minimum and maximum weights of the group were within a range of 20 of group mean weight.

For surgical procedures rats were anaesthetized with ketamine 50 mg kg and xylazine 7.5 mg kg solution that was administered intraperitoneally. Following verification of the anesthesia the area of surgery was shaved and subsequently wiped with betadine and alcohol. The surgery was performed as described previously see Herzberg et al. Pain 1999 83 169 82 . In brief the common sciatic nerve was exposed at the mid thigh level by blunt dissection through the biceps femoris and gently separated from adjacent tissue. The nerve was wrapped in a band approx. 3 mm wide and 25 mm long of sterile hemostatic oxidized cellulose SURGICEL cotton type Ethicon J J NJ USA . The SURGICEL was applied by passing curved forceps beneath the nerve taking particular care to avoid stretching the nerve grasping one end of the band and pulling it under the nerve. The end that was grasped was then gently folded over the nerve and the other end was folded over in the opposite direction. The SURGICEL was wrapped loosely around the nerve and so as not to cause any nerve constriction. Prior to application 0.2 cc of 1 carrageenan was injected into the SURGICEL band to induce a local inflammatory reaction. Before the treatment on Day 3 the rats were randomly assigned to each treatment group.

Tactile allodynia was measured by assessing the withdrawal response to calibrated Von Frey fibers. Three fibers according to force application low 8 g medium 16 g and high force fiber 26 g were employed in this study. Each fiber was applied to the paw five times and a percentage score of responses was calculated as described previously see Flatters et al. Pain 2004 109 150 61 .

On the third day following exposure of the left sciatic nerve to perineural inflammation cryopreserved placental stem cells were thawed in a 37 C. water bath. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue with an average of viability of approximately 95 . The cells were then diluted with Plasmalyte Baxter Healthcare Corporation to 4 10 1 10or 4 10cells ml in a 50 ml conical tube. Cells were subsequently withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe with a 26G needle. Within 2 hours post thaw 1 ml of placental stem cells or vehicle was administered via the tail vein. Pain levels were assessed on days 0 3 4 6 and 8.

One day after treatment Day 4 inguinal lymph nodes were collected and snap frozen for RNA isolation. Sciatic nerves were harvested at Day 8. For gene expression analysis sciatic nerves were snap frozen for RNA isolation. For flow cytometry analysis sciatic nerves were placed in D PBS on wet ice. Blood was withdrawn via cardiac puncture into EDTA collection tubes. Immediately blood samples were centrifuged at 1300 RCF for 10 minutes. Plasma was then collected and snap frozen.

Frozen rat sciatic nerve and draining lymph nodes were weighed and homogenized in appropriate volume of lysis buffer per weight using a TissueRuptor from Qiagen. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized rat sciatic nerve and draining lymph node using Qiagen s RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit according to the manufacture s protocol. The total RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop ND 1000 Thermo Fisher Scientific . cDNA was synthesized from isolated RNA using SuperScript III from Invitrogen. For gene expression individual TaqMan gene expression assays for rat were used for CD11c CD86 CD80 CD3d CD69 IL 12 IFN IL 10 and IL 17. Relative gene expression was normalized using GAPDH expression and fold change was calculated using the 2 Ct method.

Plasma cytokine measurements were performed using a rat cytokine 10 plex kit from Invitrogen that examined GM CSF IFN IL 1 IL 1 IL 2 IL 4 IL 6 IL 10 IL 12 and TNF . Plasma samples were run according to the manufacturer s protocol. Briefly antibody conjugated beads were added to the vacuum filtration plate provided. Beads were subsequently washed with the working wash solution. Standards or animal samples were added to each well and the plate was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on an orbital shaker protected from light. The wells were washed twice and a biotinylated detection antibody was added. Following 1 hour of incubation at room temperature and washing R phycoerythrin conjugated streptavidin was added to the plate for 30 minutes. The plate was washed 3 times and data acquisition was performed on a Luminex 100 using STarStaion 2.3 software. For IL 17 ELISA sciatic nerves were weighed and placed in 300.25 l medium containing 300 l of Cellytic MT mammalian tissue lysis extraction reagent Sigma Chemical Co. and 0.25 l of protease inhibitor cocktail Sigma Chemical Co. . Samples were then homogenized and centrifuged 12 500 g for 10 min . The supernatant was collected and the IL 17 level was determined by ELISA R D Systems Inc. .

Sciatic nerve samples were obtained fresh and placed in D PBS on wet ice. Nerves were dissociated to single cell suspension using a Papain Neural Dissociation Kit and the gentleMACS homogenizer from Miltenyi Biotech. Briefly single sciatic nerves were placed in C Tubes Miltenyi Biotech with 1950 l of 37 C. pre heated enzyme mix 1. C tubes were placed on gentleMACS and m brain 01 program was run. Tubes were placed on a rotator and incubated at 37 C. for 15 minutes. Sciatic nerves were run on gentleMACS program m brain02 . Afterwards 30 l of enzyme mix 2 was added. Nerves were incubated with gentle rotation at 37 C. for 10 minutes. Nerve samples were run on gentleMACS m brain03 followed by a 10 minute incubation at 37 C. The resultant suspension was passed through a 40 g cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 300 g and re suspended in FACS buffer PBS 1 FBS . Single cell suspensions were stained using 0.5 g of FITC Mouse anti rat CD3 BD Biosciences and 0.5 g of PE Mouse Anti Rat Macrophage Subset ED2 like antigen BD Biosciences . Matched Isotype controls were used to set the gating.

Immunostaining was preformed following standard protocol for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Sciatic nerves were harvested bilaterally 8 days after neuritis induction. Briefly sciatic nerves were fixed in HOPE buffer as described see Olert J Wiedorn K H Goldmann T Kuhl H Mehraein Y Scherthan H 

Immunostaining was preformed following standard protocol for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Sciatic nerves were harvested bilaterally 8 days after neuritis induction. Briefly sciatic nerves were fixed in HOPE buffer as described see Olert et al. Pathol Res Pract 2001 197 823 6 . Histological sections 5 microns were blocked in blocking solution PBS containing 1 casein 0.3 Triton X 100 and 5 Horse serum for 30 minutes. Sections were then incubated overnight with one or two of the following primary antibodies CD68 clone ED1 mouse monoclonal IgG1 Santa Cruz Biotechnology CD4 goat polyclonal IgG Santa Cruz Biotechnology and CD8 mouse monoclonal IgG2a Santa Cruz Biotechnology . After three washes in PBS slides were incubated in the appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature goat anti mouse IgG2a conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 1 500 Invitrogen goat anti mouse IgG1 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 1 500 Invitrogen donkey anti goat conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 1 500 Invitrogen . For nuclear staining 600 nM DAPI solution Sigma was applied for 10 minutes after the last PBS wash. After being washed in PBS slides were mounted in aqueous media for fluorescence Vector . Immunohistochemistry images were captured with NIKON Eclipse microscope model E800 equipped with a high resolution digital camera Nikon DXM1200F connected to PC equipped with NIS Elements software for image capture and archiving.

Data are expressed as mean SEM. Data were tabulated and analyzed using StatView software version 5.0 SAS Institute Inc. San Francisco Calif. USA . Alpha two tailed for significance in all analyses were set at 0.05. Behavioral data were analyzed with repeated measurements analysis of variance ANOVA followed by post hoc test. For ex vivo analysis the 2 tailed Student s t test was used to identify the differences between vehicle and cell treated group.

Three different calibrated monofilaments including 8 g 16 g and 26 g were used to test mechanical allodynia. The response to 16 and 26 g stimuli was consistent and repeatable at day 3 prior to treatment while scores of the rats did not respond to the 8 g stimuli. Accordingly only the data gathered from the response to 16 and 26 g stimuli were used for data analysis. As expected significant increase in the response to stimuli allodynia was developed on the 3rd day following the procedure compared to day 0 prior to neuritis induction. No significant difference was observed between vehicle and placental stem cell treated groups at that phase prior to treatment. While the vehicle had no effect on the mechanical sensitivity at 26 g stimuli the placental stem cell at 4 10significantly reduced the hind paw withdrawal from 93.3 2.98 on day 3 to 46.7 6.80 and 36.7 5.37 on days 6 and 8 respectively . A similar trend of pain reduction by placental stem cells was observed at 16 g stimuli where hind paw withdrawal was reduced from 57.8 10.24 to 22.2 7.03 and 26.7 3.33 on days 6 and 8 respectively. No significant effect was observed on the contra lateral paw .

The dose effect of placental stem cells on neuritis induced mechanical allodynia reduction was further examined. While the placental stem cells at 4 10and 1 10significantly reduced the mechanical allodynia compared to the vehicle group on Day 4 6 and 8 the placental stem cells at 4 10demonstrated a trend of pain reduction only on Day 4 . The percentage of animals responding to placental stem cell treatment demonstrated dose dependence as well .

In order to elucidate the placental stem cell mediated anti neuroinflammatory mechanism dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes were examined. As shown in the placental stem cell treated group had reduced expression of CD11c. Meanwhile dendritic cell activation markers CD86 and CD80 were suppressed by placental stem cells. In concert with the suppression of CD11c CD86 and CD80 the expression of IL 12 a key pro inflammatory cytokine secreted by differentiated dendritic cells was also significantly reduced in draining lymph nodes by placental stem cells .

Given the impaired dendridic cell ability of homing and activation conferred by placental stem cells we expected that T cell priming by dendritic cells may be subsequently affected. Indeed the expression of T cell receptor CD3 and T cell activation marker CD69 were both significantly lower in the placental stem cell treated group than control group suggesting that T cell proliferation and activation in draining lymph nodes is suppressed by placental stem cells.

Furthermore the T helper cell subpopulation was examined to test whether placental stem cells had an effect on T cell differentiation. As shown in placental stem cells significantly suppressed interferon gamma IFN in draining lymph nodes suggesting placental stem cells suppress Th 1 T cell differentiation. In addition IL 17 expression in draining lymph node as well as ipsi lateral sciatic nerve was down regulated by placental stem cells. On the other hand up regulation of the anti inflammatory cytokine IL 10 by placental stem cells was observed in draining lymph nodes as well as plasma Table 4 . Among 9 pro inflammatory cytokines tested in plasma four pro inflammatory cytokines including IFN IL 2 IL 6 and IL 12 were down regulated by placental stem cells while no difference of IL 1 was observed between the placental stem cell and vehicle groups Table 4 . Other cytokines including GM CSF IL 1 IL 4 and TNF were below the level of detection in plasma.

Next leukocyte infiltration into the ipsi lateral sciatic nerve was examined. Macrophage markers Emr1 and CD68 were down regulated in the placental stem cell treated group indicating less macrophage recruitment and activation . Dendritic cell infiltration and activation was also suppressed by placental stem cells evidenced by down regulation of CD11c CD80 and IL 12 expression . Furthermore T cell infiltration and activation was suppressed by placental stem cells as well indicated by reduced expression of CD3 and CD69 in the placental stem cell treated group . Consistent with the above gene expression results the flow cytometry analysis of a single cell suspension from the ipsi lateral sciatic nerve showed that only 1.5 CD3 cells and 3.9 ED2 cells were detected in the placental stem cell treated group compared with 13.3 CD3 and 8.0 ED2 cells in the vehicle group . H E staining revealed severe epineural edema and inflammatory infiltrates in the vehicle group compared with normal and placental stem cell treated animals . The expression of CD68 CD8 and CD4 were all attenuated in the placental stem cell treated group compared with vehicle.

Furthermore chemokines including CCL2 CCL12 and CXCL1 were suppressed by placental stem cells in the ipsi lateral sciatic nerve .

In conclusion this Example demonstrates that placental stem cells reduce mechanical allodynia induced by perineural inflammation. Moreover placental stem cells suppress T cell priming and modulate T cell differentiation in draining lymph nodes by inhibiting dendritic cell homing to draining lymph nodes and by attenuating the activation of dendritic cells.

Seventy seven male Sprague Dawley rats 3 months old approximately 200 250 g at study initiation were included in the study. Minimum and maximum weights of the group were within a range of 20 of group mean weight. Following several days of habituation the rats underwent baseline measurements for pain behavior tactile allodynia and motor sensory assessment rotarod test . All the rats underwent Sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury CCI pain development was verified on the 6th day following the operation and sensory motor behavior on the 7th. On the 8th day following the procedure the rats were assigned randomly to the various treatment groups Table 5 . Pain levels were assessed on the 6th 10th 16th 25th and 30th days following the procedure. Motor sensory coordination was assessed on the 11th 21st 26th and 34th days. On the 35th day the rats were euthanized the sciatic nerves both sides were collected and embedded in paraffin. Spleen and lymph nodes underwent snap freezing and the maximum amount of blood that was processed to plasma was collected.

For surgical procedures rats were anaesthetized with ketamine 50 mg kg and xylazine 7.5 mg kg solution that was administered IP. Following verification of the anesthesia the area of surgery was shaved and subsequently sterilized with betadine and alcohol wipe. The rats eyes were lubricated.

The surgery was performed as previously described see Bennett and Xie Pain 1988 33 87 107 . In brief the common sciatic nerve was exposed at the mid thigh level by blunt dissection through the biceps femoris and gently separated from adjacent tissue. Proximal to the sciatic trifurcation the nerve was gently freed of adhering tissue for about 7 mm and 3 ligatures 4 0 chromic gut were tied loosely around it with a 1.0 1.5 mm interval between each. The ligatures were tied such that the nerve was barely constricted and the circulation through the superficial epineural vasculature was not arrested. The incision was closed in layers using 3 0 Vicryl sutures for the muscle and wound clips for the skin.

Pain level was evaluated using a Tactile allodynia test. In this test the withdrawal response to calibrated Von Frey fibers is measured. Three fibers according to force application low 8 g medium 16 g and high force fiber 26 g were employed in this study. Each fiber was applied to the paw five times and a percentage score of responses was calculated see Flatters et al. Pain 2004 109 150 161 . The most reliable and repeatable score at baseline levels were the response to 26 g therefore statistical analysis was performed on the 26 g data.

Motor sensory coordination was evaluated with the Rotarod Test. In this test the rodent is placed on a rotating rod and the speed of rotation is gradually increased. The rodent s ability to remain on the rotating rod is recorded time in seconds . The speed used was 4 40 rpm max 180 sec with a drop height less than 30 cm. The purpose of the Rotarod test is to assess the rodent s motor sensory coordination. The test is sensitive to drugs that affect motor function and helps to assess the sedative effect of a medication.

Gabapentin was prepared in Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS . The dose used was 100 mg ml and 0.25 ml was injected into the 250 g rats intraperitoneally IP . The same volume of PBS was injected into the control group IP.

Data were tabulated and analyzed using StatView software version 5.0 SAS Institute Inc. San Francisco Calif. USA . Alpha two tailed for significance in all analyses were set at 0.05. Behavioral statistics were calculated only for rats with data at all time points. A repeated measurements analysis of variance ANOVA followed by post hoc test was used for the pain and motor sensory coordination scores. Pain development was verified by comparison to baseline levels. Effect on pain was made by comparison to pain level on the 6th day following the procedure.

As demonstrated in six days following the procedure a significant increase in the responses indicating pain was demonstrated in all of the groups.

Intramuscular IM administration of 4 10placental stem cells significantly reduced the pain for the duration of the study on days 10 16 25 and 30 . The intravenous IV administration of placental stem cells significantly reduced pain. In particular IV administration of 4 10placental stem cells significantly reduced the pain on days 16 25 and 30 and IV administration of placental stem cells at 1 10demonstrated a significant pain reduction effect on day 16 . As expected the systemic administration of gabapentin significantly reduced the pain on days 10 16 25 and 30 C .

As demonstrated in the gabapentin treated control group demonstrated a significant reduction in the time spent on the rotarod altered motor sensory coordination while the placental stem cell treated group s vehicle motor sensory coordination was similar to the vehicle treated group not affected following IV or IM administration.

IV or IM administration of placental stem cells reduces neuropathic pain induced by Sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury. The placental stem cell effect on pain reduction was similar to gabapentin. However while gabapentin induced significant motor sensory coordination deficiency the placental stem cells did not.
