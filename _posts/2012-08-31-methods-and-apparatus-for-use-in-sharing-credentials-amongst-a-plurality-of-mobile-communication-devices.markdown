The present disclosure relates generally to the sharing of credentials amongst a plurality of mobile communication devices operative for wireless communications in a wireless communication network.

A mobile communication device such as a portable wireless telephony device or a smartphone is configured to communicate in wireless communication networks. For example such a device may communicate in cellular telecommunications networks and or wireless local area networks WLANs .

Such a device may utilize a number of different data applications e.g. social networking applications such as Facebook Twitter etc. or other applications having confirmed purchases . Each of these applications may require different credentials for access. Also a user may own or operate more than one mobile device and wish to share these credentials amongst all of the mobile devices.

Techniques for use in sharing a plurality of credential objects of a user account amongst a plurality of mobile devices operative in a wireless network are described herein. A network infrastructure stores a plurality of encrypted credential objects in association with the user account. Each encrypted credential object is encrypted with a credential key. The network infrastructure also stores a plurality of encrypted forms of the credential key in association with the user account. Each encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with a respective one of a plurality of device keys. Each device key is different from every other device key and each encrypted form of the credential key is different from every other encrypted form of the credential key. Each device key is stored at a respective one of the mobile devices. The network infrastructure provides to the mobile devices access to the encrypted credential key and the encrypted credential objects. Each mobile device decrypts one of the encrypted forms of the credential key with a stored device key so that the mobile device may decrypt the encrypted credential objects with the credential key.

For initially establishing such a shared credentials environment a mobile device may operate as follows. The mobile device generates the credential key associated with the user account which is utilized to encrypt the credential objects. The mobile device also generates a device key. The mobile device encrypts the credential key with its device key. The mobile device may send the encrypted credential key for storage in association with the user account.

An additional mobile device may be added on for sharing such credentials. A target mobile device produces a request message for a key exchange where the request message includes a target identifier which identifies the target mobile device and a target device key generated by the target mobile device. The target mobile device signs the request message with a digital signature. The target mobile device sends the signed request message to a source mobile device. If the request message is positively verified the target mobile device receives a response message from the source mobile device. The response message includes the target identifier and an encrypted form of the credential key. The encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with the target device key. The target mobile device is then able to decrypt the encrypted form of the credential key with the target device key for producing the credential key and then receive and decrypt the credential objects with the credential key.

Example Environment. To illustrate one environment within which the techniques of the present disclosure may be practiced illustrates a mobile communication device which may communicate in a communication system . In the communication system mobile device may communicate with one or more wireless communication networks. For example mobile device may communicate with a wireless communication network comprising a wireless local area network WLAN . Here wireless network and mobile device may operate in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards.

In this example wireless network has a plurality of wireless access points APs and for wireless communications with mobile device . WLANs may be identified by a mobile device with use of a wireless network identifier which is communicated from the WLAN. The wireless network identifier may be for example a Set Service Identifier SSID or Extended SSID ESSID . In this example wireless network includes one or more servers a redirect server and a gateway . Server may provide data applications and or functionality for communication services for mobile device .

Wireless network may comprise a public Wi Fi hotspot for public use and include what may be referred to as a captive portal or walled garden. For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway is configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality as well as to permit or deny external access outside of wireless network to Internet . To do this gateway has a set of IP address filters which define a set of addresses that are permissible impermissible if any at all for access by devices. Access by a device depends on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization.

Typically when a request by a device in wireless network is made prior to proper authorization gateway is configured to redirect the request to redirect server . In response redirect server is configured to respond to mobile device to provide data for producing information e.g. Web page information which is rendered in a visual display of mobile device via a Web browser application. The information may solicit a user response. For example the information may solicit a user registration or login with user fields for entering a user name and or password information. Gateway identifies whether the received user response is sufficient e.g. whether the user name and password match prestored user name and password information whether the user payment is accepted whether the user acceptance is confirmed etc. . If the user response is deemed sufficient gateway permits access to the data applications and or functionality in or outside of wireless network .

Mobile device may also operate for communications in other different wireless networks such as a wireless network comprising a WLAN. In this example wireless network comprises a private communication network of an enterprise e.g. an organization a company a corporation etc. of mobile device . Similar to wireless network wireless network has a plurality of wireless APs and one or more servers and a gateway . For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway may be configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality offered via wireless network depending on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization. For devices attempting to access wireless network via Internet gateway is configured to permit or deny internal access to the data applications and or functionality in wireless network .

Such wireless networks e.g. infrastructure WLANs may provide or allow access to various data and communication services to its terminals. For example the wireless networks may provide for communication access to Internet via the Web browser application or voice telephony communication service with use of Voice over IP VoIP communication or other communication services. For push type data or message synchronization services for example mobile device may be enabled to maintain data synchronization with a server for user data of an application associated with a user account. The application of mobile device and the server may be or include for example an electronic mail e mail application program for the communication of e mail messages.

Mobile device may be additionally configured to access communication services via a Public Land Wireless Network PLMN e.g. a cellular telecommunications network . PLMN includes a core network a plurality of base station controllers such as a base station controller BSC coupled to core network and a plurality of base stations such as a base station BS and a base station coupled to associated BSCs . Core network BSC and BS operate in a conventional fashion as well documented. Other PLMNs in the environment have a similar or the same architecture as PLMN . For communication with PLMNs mobile device may be configured in accordance with one or more cellular telecommunication standards such as Global Systems for Mobile GSM and or General Packet Radio Service GPRS technologies. However such mobile device may additionally or alternatively operate in accordance with other such cellular standards such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE or Enhanced GPRS EGPRS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Long Term Evolution LTE or EVolution Data Only EV DO for CDMA technologies as a few examples.

Further in additional to being operative for communications with infrastructure WLANs e.g. IEEE 802.11 infrastructure WLANs mobile device may additionally or alternatively communicate using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device. The Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Accordingly illustrated further in a user of mobile device may use one or more other mobile devices and in . Mobile devices may be operative to communicate over short range wireless links. For example the devices may establish Wi Fi P2P wireless network connections with each other in a Wi Fi P2P wireless network. Here one of the communication devices may be configured to enter into an AP mode of operation so that other communication devices may associate with them for direct RF communications therebetween. An AP mode of operation which may be referred to as a wireless AP mode or the like provides a benefit due to the high data rates available over WLAN links. Here again data may be communicated directly between the mobile devices without the data traversing any wireless network infrastructure where one of the devices is set to operate or serve as an AP switching operation from as an end terminal and the other device operates as an end terminal to associate and connect with the AP i.e. mobile device operating as an AP for communications. Mobile device may operate such that when in the AP mode of operation with other communication devices and it also operates as a client with another AP.

Mobile device as well as other mobile devices and of the same user may operate to access a network infrastructure . Network infrastructure stores a plurality of credentials associated with a user account of the user. Network infrastructure includes one or more servers and or databases e.g. memory for the storage of user data. Such network infrastructure for remote storage may be referred to as the cloud .

In the present disclosure network infrastructure stores a plurality of encrypted credential objects in association with the user account. Each encrypted credential object is encrypted in accordance with a credential key. Network infrastructure also stores a plurality of encrypted forms of the credential key in association with the user account. Each encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with one of a plurality of device keys. Each device key is stored at one of the mobile devices . Network infrastructure provides to the mobile devices access to the encrypted credential key and the encrypted credential objects. Each mobile device decrypts one of the encrypted forms of the credential key with a stored device key so that the mobile device may decrypt the encrypted credential objects with the credential key.

The device key may be an asymmetric encryption key. The asymmetric encryption key may include a public key and a private key and the private key will not e.g. never be communicated from the mobile device to maintain security. The device keys are not stored in the network infrastructure.

The network infrastructure provides to the mobile devices access to the encrypted credential objects and the encrypted credential key step of . A mobile device may receive at least one of the encrypted forms of the credential key and decrypt it with use of its stored device key for producing the credential key. The mobile device may then subsequently receive the encrypted credential objects and decrypt them with use of the credential key. In order to obtain such access the mobile device may submit authentication credentials e.g. a user identifier and password to the network infrastructure. If positively verified the mobile device is allowed access as described. The flowchart of ends at an end block .

The method of may make use of a network infrastructure e.g. a cloud or remote storage which is configured to store a plurality of encrypted credential objects in association with a user account for a user. Each encrypted credential object is encrypted in accordance with a credential key. The credential key may be a symmetric encryption key. The network infrastructure is also configured to store a plurality of encrypted forms of the credential key in association with the user account. Each encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with one of a plurality of device keys. Each device key is stored at one of the mobile devices. The device key may be an asymmetric encryption key.

In order to initially establish a user account the first mobile device may submit a request to the network infrastructure and establish authentication credentials e.g. a user identifier and password . If the mobile device is properly authorized a procedure for initially establishing the user account is performed.

Beginning at a start block of a mobile device produces a credential key step of . In one example the credential key is a symmetric encryption key. This credential key is not or never stored in the network infrastructure in unencrypted form. The mobile device also produces a device key step of FIG. . The device key may be an asymmetric encryption key. The device key is stored in memory of the mobile device e.g. in protected space . The mobile device is not authorized to send and does not send a private key of the asymmetric encryption key from the device.

The credential objects will be encrypted with the credential key for producing encrypted credential objects step of . The encrypted credential objects are stored in memory of the mobile device and are also sent to the network infrastructure for storage in association with the user account. The mobile device also encrypts the credential key with the device key step of . The mobile device sends the encrypted credential key for storage in association with the user account of .

Subsequently the mobile device may receive an encrypted credential key decrypt the encrypted credential key with its device key for producing the credential key and then decrypt at least one of the encrypted credential objects with the credential key.

One or more additional mobile devices e.g. a second mobile device may be added to the user account or for sharing of the credentials amongst multiple mobile devices. When such additional mobile device attempts to obtain access submitting authentication credentials e.g. user identifier and password to the network infrastructure this triggers a key exchange process with the first or master mobile device.

Again the method of may be performed by two mobile devices in the environments described above. One of the mobile devices may be deemed a master or source device and the other device a slave or target device. A left column in the flowchart indicates actions which are taken by the target or slave device whereas a right hand column in the flowchart indicates actions which are taken by the source or master device. More particularly the techniques described in relation to the flowchart of may be performed by one or more controllers or processors of the mobile device. A computer program product which may embody the technique may include a computer readable medium e.g. memory computer disk CD ROM etc. having computer instructions stored therein which are executable by the one or more processors of the mobile device for performing the technique.

The method of may make use of a network infrastructure e.g. a cloud or remote storage see e.g. the discussion in relation to which stores a plurality of encrypted credential objects in association with a user account. Each encrypted credential object is encrypted in accordance with a credential key. The credential key may be a symmetric encryption key. The network infrastructure also stores one or more encrypted forms of the credential key in association with the user account. Each encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with one of a plurality of device keys. Each device key is stored at one of the mobile devices.

In particular the source mobile device which is identified by a source identifier e.g. a Personal Identification Number or PIN of the source mobile device stores in its memory a source device key. The source device key may be an asymmetric encryption key. A first encrypted form of the credential key is stored in association with the user account and the first encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with the source device key.

The method of is initiated in response to an indication that the target mobile device is to be included as an authorized device for the user account for obtaining access to the stored credentials in the network infrastructure. A user of the target mobile device submits authentication credentials e.g. user identifier and password to the network infrastructure. If positively verified the target mobile device proceeds to perform a key exchange process with the source mobile device. For this purpose the target mobile device produces a target device key. The target device key may be randomly generated and may further be an asymmetric encryption key.

Beginning at a start block of the target mobile device produces a request message for the key exchange step of . The request message may include the user identity of the user account a target identifier which identifies the target mobile device e.g. a Personal Identification Number or PIN of the target mobile device and the target device key of the target mobile device. The request message may also include a salt. A salt may generally be viewed as a plurality of random bits creating one of the inputs to a one way function. The target mobile device signs the request message with a digital signature step of . The target mobile device sends the signed request message to the source mobile device step of .

In some embodiments the request message is sent to the source mobile device via the wireless network through the network infrastructure. In other embodiments the request message is sent directly to the source mobile device over a short range wireless link e.g. a Bluetooth wireless link or a Wi Fi Peer to Peer P2P wireless link or a NFC link etc. .

The source mobile device receives the request message for the key exchange step of . Again the request message includes the target identifier which identifies the target mobile device and the target device key of the target mobile device. The request message may also include the user identity of the user account. The source mobile device verifies the digital signature of the request message step of .

If the request message is not positively verified in step then the process is aborted. On the other hand if the request message is positively verified in step the source mobile device sends a response message to the target mobile device step of . The response message may include the user identity of the user account the target identifier and a second encrypted form of the credential key. The second encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with the target device key. The response message may also include a salt of the source mobile device. The source mobile device may also sign the response message with a new digital signature.

The target mobile device receives the response message from the source device step of . The response message includes the user identity of the user account the target identifier and the second encrypted form of the credential key being encrypted with the target device key. If the response message is not positively verified then the process is aborted. On the other hand if the response message is positively verified the target mobile device continues further processing.

Namely the target mobile device is able to decrypt the encrypted form of the credential key for producing the credential key. The target mobile device may then receive the encrypted credential objects and decrypt them with the credential key.

Advantageously as a user may own or operate more than one mobile device the techniques provided herein assist in securely and reliably transferring such credentials between multiple mobile devices. The credentials are securely kept on the mobile devices without storing them off the devices in unencrypted form.

Thus techniques for use in sharing a plurality of credential objects of a user account amongst a plurality of mobile devices operative in a wireless network have been described herein. A network infrastructure stores a plurality of encrypted credential objects in association with the user account. Each encrypted credential object is encrypted with a credential key. The network infrastructure also stores a plurality of encrypted forms of the credential key in association with the user account. Each encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with a respective one of a plurality of device keys. Each device key is stored at a respective one of the mobile devices. The network infrastructure provides to the mobile devices access to the encrypted credential key and the encrypted credential objects. Each mobile device decrypts one of the encrypted forms of the credential key with a stored device key so that the mobile device may decrypt the encrypted credential objects with the credential key.

For initially establishing such a shared credentials environment a mobile device may operate as follows. The mobile device generates the credential key associated with the user account which is utilized to encrypt the credential objects. The mobile device also generates a device key. The mobile device encrypts the credential key with its device key. The mobile device may send the encrypted credential key for storage in association with the user account.

An additional mobile device may be added on for sharing such credentials. A target mobile device produces a request message for a key exchange where the request message includes a target identifier which identifies the target mobile device and a target device key generated by the target mobile device. The target mobile device signs the request message with a digital signature. The target mobile device sends the signed request message to a source mobile device. If the request message is positively verified the target mobile device receives a response message from the source mobile device. The response message includes the target identifier and an encrypted form of the credential key. The encrypted form of the credential key is encrypted with the target device key. The target mobile device is then able to decrypt the encrypted form of the credential key with the target device key for producing the credential key and then receive and decrypt the credential objects with the credential key.
