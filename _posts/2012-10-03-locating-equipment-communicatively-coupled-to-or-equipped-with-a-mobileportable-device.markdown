Field service operations may be any operation in which companies dispatch technicians and or other staff to perform certain activities for example installations services and or repairs. Field service operations may exist in various industries examples of which include but are not limited to network installations utility installations security systems construction medical equipment heating ventilating and air conditioning HVAC and the like.

An example of a field service operation in the construction industry is a so called locate and marking operation also commonly referred to more simply as a locate operation or sometimes merely as a locate . In a typical locate operation a locate technician visits a work site in which there is a plan to disturb the ground e.g. excavate dig one or more holes and or trenches bore etc. so as to determine a presence or an absence of one or more underground facilities such as various types of utility cables and pipes in a dig area to be excavated or disturbed at the work site. In some instances a locate operation may be requested for a design project in which there may be no immediate plan to excavate or otherwise disturb the ground but nonetheless information about a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities at a work site may be valuable to inform a planning permitting and or engineering design phase of a future construction project.

In many states an excavator who plans to disturb ground at a work site is required by law to notify any potentially affected underground facility owners prior to undertaking an excavation activity. Advanced notice of excavation activities may be provided by an excavator or another party by contacting a one call center. One call centers typically are operated by a consortium of underground facility owners for the purposes of receiving excavation notices and in turn notifying facility owners and or their agents of a plan to excavate. As part of an advanced notification excavators typically provide to the one call center various information relating to the planned activity including a location e.g. address of the work site and a description of the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed at the work site.

A locate operation typically is initiated as a result of an excavator providing an excavation notice to a one call center. An excavation notice also is commonly referred to as a locate request and may be provided by the excavator to the one call center via an electronic mail message information entry via a website maintained by the one call center or a telephone conversation between the excavator and a human operator at the one call center. The locate request may include an address or some other location related information describing the geographic location of a work site at which the excavation is to be performed as well as a description of the dig area e.g. a text description such as its location relative to certain landmarks and or its approximate dimensions within which there is a plan to disturb the ground at the work site. One call centers similarly may receive locate requests for design projects for which as discussed above there may be no immediate plan to excavate or otherwise disturb the ground .

Once underground facilities implicated by the locate request are identified by a one call center the one call center generates a locate request ticket also known as a locate ticket or simply a ticket . The locate request ticket essentially constitutes an instruction to inspect a work site and typically identifies the work site of the proposed excavation or design and a description of the dig area typically lists on the ticket all of the underground facilities that may be present at the work site e.g. by providing a member code for the facility owner of an underground facility and may also include various other information relevant to the proposed excavation or design e.g. the name of the excavation company a name of a property owner or party contracting the excavation company to perform the excavation etc. . The one call center sends the ticket to one or more underground facility owners and or one or more locate service providers who may be acting as contracted agents of the facility owners so that they can conduct a locate and marking operation to verify a presence or absence of the underground facilities in the dig area. For example in some instances a given underground facility owner may operate its own fleet of locate technicians in which case the one call center may send the ticket to the underground facility owner. In other instances a given facility owner may contract with a locate service provider to receive locate request tickets and perform a locate and marking operation in response to received tickets on their behalf.

Upon receiving the locate request a locate service provider or a facility owner hereafter referred to as a ticket recipient may dispatch a locate technician to the work site of planned excavation to determine a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities in the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed. A typical first step for the locate technician includes utilizing an underground facility locate device which is an instrument or set of instruments also referred to commonly as a locate set for detecting facilities that are concealed in some manner such as cables and pipes that are located underground. The locate device is employed by the technician to verify the presence or absence of underground facilities indicated in the locate request ticket as potentially present in the dig area e.g. via the facility owner member codes listed in the ticket . This process is often referred to as a locate operation. 

In one example of a locate operation an underground facility locate device is used to detect electromagnetic fields that are generated by an applied signal provided along a length of a target facility to be identified. In this example a locate device may include both a signal transmitter to provide the applied signal e.g. which is coupled by the locate technician to a tracer wire disposed along a length of a facility and a signal receiver which is generally a hand held apparatus carried by the locate technician as the technician walks around the dig area to search for underground facilities. illustrates a conventional locate device indicated by the dashed box that includes a transmitter and a locate receiver . The transmitter is connected via a connection point to a target object in this example underground facility located in the ground . The transmitter generates the applied signal which is coupled to the underground facility via the connection point e.g. to a tracer wire along the facility resulting in the generation of a magnetic field . The magnetic field in turn is detected by the locate receiver which itself may include one or more detection antenna not shown . The locate receiver indicates a presence of a facility when it detects electromagnetic fields arising from the applied signal . Conversely the absence of a signal detected by the locate receiver generally indicates the absence of the target facility.

In yet another example a locate device employed for a locate operation may include a single instrument similar in some respects to a conventional metal detector. In particular such an instrument may include an oscillator to generate an alternating current that passes through a coil which in turn produces a first magnetic field. If a piece of electrically conductive metal is in close proximity to the coil e.g. if an underground facility having a metal component is below near the coil of the instrument eddy currents are induced in the metal and the metal produces its own magnetic field which in turn affects the first magnetic field. The instrument may include a second coil to measure changes to the first magnetic field thereby facilitating detection of metallic objects.

In addition to the locate operation the locate technician also generally performs a marking operation in which the technician marks the presence and in some cases the absence of a given underground facility in the dig area based on the various signals detected or not detected during the locate operation. For this purpose the locate technician conventionally utilizes a marking device to dispense a marking material on for example the ground pavement or other surface along a detected underground facility. Marking material may be any material substance compound and or element used or which may be used separately or in combination to mark signify and or indicate. Examples of marking materials may include but are not limited to paint chalk dye and or iron. Marking devices such as paint marking wands and or paint marking wheels provide a convenient method of dispensing marking materials onto surfaces such as onto the surface of the ground or pavement.

In the mechanical actuation system of the marking device includes an actuator or mechanical trigger proximate to the handle that is actuated triggered by the technician e.g. via pulling depressing or squeezing with fingers hand . The actuator is connected to a mechanical coupler e.g. a rod disposed inside and along a length of the elongated shaft . The coupler is in turn connected to an actuation mechanism at the distal end of the shaft which mechanism extends outward from the shaft in the direction of the spray nozzle . Thus the actuator the mechanical coupler and the actuation mechanism constitute the mechanical actuation system of the marking device .

In some environments arrows flags darts or other types of physical marks may be used to mark the presence or absence of an underground facility in a dig area in addition to or as an alternative to a material applied to the ground such as paint chalk dye tape along the path of a detected utility. The marks resulting from any of a wide variety of materials and or objects used to indicate a presence or absence of underground facilities generally are referred to as locate marks. Often different color materials and or physical objects may be used for locate marks wherein different colors correspond to different utility types. For example the American Public Works Association APWA has established a standardized color coding system for utility identification for use by public agencies utilities contractors and various groups involved in ground excavation e.g. red electric power lines and cables blue potable water orange telecommunication lines yellow gas oil steam . In some cases the technician also may provide one or more marks to indicate that no facility was found in the dig area sometimes referred to as a clear .

As mentioned above the foregoing activity of identifying and marking a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities generally is referred to for completeness as a locate and marking operation. However in light of common parlance adopted in the construction industry and or for the sake of brevity one or both of the respective locate and marking functions may be referred to in some instances simply as a locate operation or a locate i.e. without making any specific reference to the marking function . Accordingly it should be appreciated that any reference in the relevant arts to the task of a locate technician simply as a locate operation or a locate does not necessarily exclude the marking portion of the overall process. At the same time in some contexts a locate operation is identified separately from a marking operation wherein the former relates more specifically to detection related activities and the latter relates more specifically to marking related activities.

Inaccurate locating and or marking of underground facilities can result in physical damage to the facilities property damage and or personal injury during the excavation process that in turn can expose a facility owner or contractor to significant legal liability. When underground facilities are damaged and or when property damage or personal injury results from damaging an underground facility during an excavation the excavator may assert that the facility was not accurately located and or marked by a locate technician while the locate contractor who dispatched the technician may in turn assert that the facility was indeed properly located and marked. Proving whether the underground facility was properly located and marked can be difficult after the excavation or after some damage e.g. a gas explosion because in many cases the physical locate marks e.g. the marking material or other physical marks used to mark the facility on the surface of the dig area will have been disturbed or destroyed during the excavation process and or damage resulting from excavation .

Previous efforts at documenting locate operations have focused primarily on locate devices that employ electromagnetic fields to determine the presence of an underground facility. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 576 973 naming inventor Alan Haddy and entitled Apparatus and Method for Obtaining Geographical Positional Data for an Object Located Underground hereafter Haddy is directed to a locate device i.e. a locator that receives and stores data from a global positioning system GPS to identify the position of the locate device as an underground object e.g. a cable is detected by the locate device. Haddy notes that by recording geographical position data relating to the detected underground object there is no need to physically mark the location of the underground object on the ground surface and the recorded position data may be used in the future to re locate the underground object.

Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 7 319 387 naming inventors Willson et al. and entitled GPS Interface for Locating Device hereafter Willson is directed to a locate device for locating position markers i.e. passive antennas that reflect back RF signals and which are installed along buried utilities. In Willson a GPS device may be communicatively coupled to the locate device or alternatively provided as an integrated part of the locate device to store GPS coordinate data associated with position markers detected by the locate device. Electronic memory is provided in the locate device for storing a data record of the GPS coordinate data and the data record may be uploaded to a remote computer and used to update a mapping database for utilities.

U.S. Publication No. 2006 0282280 naming inventors Stotz et al. and entitled Ticket and Data Management hereafter Stotz also is directed to a locate device i.e. a locator including a GPS receiver. Upon detection of the presence of a utility line Stotz locate device can update ticket data with GPS coordinates for the detected utility line. Once the locate device has updated the ticket data the reconfigured ticket data may be transmitted to a network.

U.S. Publication No. 2007 0219722 naming inventors Sawyer Jr. et al. and entitled System and Method for Collecting and Updating Geographical Data hereafter Sawyer is directed to collecting and recording data representative of the location and characteristics of utilities and infrastructure in the field for creating a grid or map. Sawyer employs a field data collection unit including a locating pole that is placed on top of or next to a utility to be identified and added to the grid or map. The locating pole includes an antenna coupled to a location determination system such as a GPS unit to provide longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the utility under or next to the end of the locating pole. The data gathered by the field data collection unit is sent to a server to provide a permanent record that may be used for damage prevention and asset management operations.

Applicants have recognized and appreciated that uncertainties which may be attendant to locate and marking operations may be significantly reduced by collecting various information particularly relating to the marking operation and in some cases both the marking operation and the corresponding locate operation rather than merely focusing on information relating to detection of underground facilities via a locate device. In many instances excavators arriving to a work site have only physical locate marks on which to rely to indicate a presence or absence of underground facilities and they are not generally privy to information that may have been collected previously during the locate operation. Accordingly the integrity and accuracy of the physical locate marks applied during a marking operation arguably is significantly more important in connection with reducing risk of damage and or injury during excavation than the location of where an underground facility was detected via a locate device during a locate operation.

More specifically Applicants have recognized and appreciated that conventional techniques for using a locate device to detect underground facilities are sometimes tentative and typically iterative in nature and use of locate devices with GPS capabilities may result in redundant spurious and or incomplete geographic location data collection. For example during a typical locate operation a technician attempting to locate an underground facility with a locate device often needs to sweep an appreciable area around a suspected underground facility and make multiple passes with the locate device over the underground facility to obtain meaningful detection signals. Furthermore the technician often needs to rely significantly on visual observations of the area including relevant landmarks such as facility connections to buildings transformer boxes maintenance public access points curbs sidewalks roadways etc. to effectively deduce a sensible path of an underground facility to be located. The foregoing is particularly true if at some point during the locate operation the technician loses a signal from an underground facility in the process of being detected e.g. due to a broken transmitter circuit path from a damaged tracer wire and loss of the transmitter s applied signal . In view of the foregoing it may be readily appreciated that collecting and logging geographic location information throughout this process may result in excessive and or imprecise data or in some instances incomplete relevant data e.g. in the case of signal loss broken tracer wire from which it may be difficult to cull the data that is truly complete and representative of where the underground facility ultimately was detected.

Yet Applicants have recognized and appreciated that collecting location data such as GPS data in connection with use of a locate device may be valuable for reasons other than marking a location of an underground facility. For example the data may be valuable in monitoring the performance of a technician e.g. by comparing performance to a known signature of a technician s historical performance mapping areas of poor signal strength or for other reasons. The data may be processed in various manners of use to various parties depending on their particular interest in a locate operation. In addition as described further below the collection of GPS data with respect to both locate and marking operations as opposed to locate operations alone may also provide valuable insight and analysis potential with respect to various aspects e.g. technician performance comparison to historical data etc. of a locate operation.

Furthermore Applicants have recognized and appreciated that the location at which an underground facility ultimately is detected during a locate operation is not always where the technician physically marks the ground pavement or other surface during a marking operation in fact technician imprecision or negligence as well as various ground conditions and or different operating conditions amongst different locate devices may in some instances result in significant discrepancies between detected location and physical locate marks. Accordingly having documentation e.g. an electronic record of where physical locate marks were actually dispensed i.e. what an excavator encounters when arriving to a work site is notably more relevant to the assessment of liability in the event of damage and or injury than where an underground facility was detected prior to marking.

Examples of marking devices configured to collect some types of information relating specifically to marking operations are provided in U.S. publication no. 2008 0228294 A1 published Sep. 18 2008 filed Mar. 13 2007 and entitled Marking System and Method With Location and or Time Tracking and U.S. publication no. 2008 0245299 A1 published Oct. 9 2008 filed Apr. 4 2007 and entitled Marking System and Method both of which publications are incorporated herein by reference. These publications describe amongst other things collecting information relating to the geographic location time and or characteristics e.g. color type of dispensed marking material from a marking device and generating an electronic record based on this collected information. Applicants have recognized and appreciated that collecting information relating to both geographic location and color of dispensed marking material provides for automated correlation of geographic information for a locate mark to facility type e.g. red electric power lines and cables blue potable water orange telecommunication lines yellow gas oil steam in contrast in conventional locate devices equipped with GPS capabilities as discussed above there is no apparent automated provision for readily linking GPS information for a detected facility to the type of facility detected.

In view of marking devices configured to collect information relating specifically to marking operations Applicants have further appreciated that collecting information relating to both locate operations and corresponding marking operations further facilitates ensuring the accuracy of such operations to this end Applicants have recognized that various advantages may be obtained via communication and sharing of information between locate devices and marking devices and or combining the respective functionalities of such devices into an integrated instrument.

In some exemplary implementations the mobile portable device may provide via execution of processor executable instructions or applications on a hardware processor of the mobile portable device and or via retrieval of external instructions external applications and or other external information via a communication interface of the mobile portable device essentially all of the processing and related functionality required to operate the equipment. In other implementations the mobile portable device may only provide some portion of the overall functionality. In yet other implementations the mobile portable device may provide redundant shared and or backup functionality for the equipment to enhance robustness.

In one exemplary implementation a mobile portable device may be mechanically coupled to the locate device marking device or combined locate and marking device e.g. via an appropriate cradle harness or other attachment arrangement or otherwise integrated with the device and communicatively coupled to the device e.g. via one or more wired or wireless connections so as to permit one or more electronic signals to be communicated between the mobile portable device and other components of the locate device marking device or combined locate and marking device.

In some exemplary implementations one or more electronic signals indicative of operation of the locating equipment may be supplied by one or more components of the locating equipment to the mobile portable device. In other aspects the mobile portable device may be appropriately programmed so as to log and generate electronic records of various locate information marking information and or landmark information which records may be formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed on the mobile portable device and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server for storage processing and or analysis. In one example one or more pieces of geo location data e.g. from a GPS receiver which may be integrated with the mobile portable device are collected and logged on the mobile portable device per actuation of the locating equipment e.g. a trigger pull of a marking device or a combined locate and marking device to dispense marking material or a trigger pull of a locate device to acquire magnetic field data or other locate information . A computer generated image or other visual representation of the locate and or marking operation may be electronically rendered in a display field of the mobile portable device based on logged locate information marking information and or landmark information essentially in real time as the marking operation is conducted and or recreated thereafter based on one or more stored electronic records.

As shown in in one embodiment marking device includes control electronics the components of which are powered by a power source . Power source may be any power source that is suitable for use in a portable device such as but not limited to one or more rechargeable batteries one or more non rechargeable batteries a solar photovoltaic panel a standard AC power plug feeding an AC to DC converter and the like.

The marking device is configured to hold a marking dispenser which as shown in is loaded into a marking material holder of the marking device . In one exemplary implementation the marking dispenser is an aerosol paint canister that contains paint however it should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited in this respect as a marking material dispensed by the marking device may be any material substance compound and or element used to mark signify and or indicate. Examples of marking materials may include but are not limited to paint chalk dye and or marking powder.

As also shown in in one embodiment control electronics of marking device may include but are not limited to a processor at least a portion of an actuation system another portion of which may include one or more mechanical elements a local memory a communication interface a user interface a timing system and a location tracking system .

The processor may be any general purpose processor controller or microcontroller device. Local memory may be any volatile or non volatile data storage device such as but not limited to a random access memory RAM device and a removable memory device e.g. a universal serial bus USB flash drive a multimedia card MMC a secure digital card SD a compact flash card CF etc. . As discussed further below the local memory may store a marking data algorithm which may be a set of processor executable instructions that when executed by the processor causes the processor to control various other components of the marking device so as to generate an electronic record of a marking operation which record also may be stored in the local memory and or transmitted in essentially real time as it is being generated or after completion of a marking operation to a remote device e.g. remote computer .

In one exemplary implementation a Linux based processing system for embedded handheld and or wireless devices may be employed in the marking device to implement various components of the control electronics . For example the Fingertip4 processing system including a Marvell PXA270 processor and available from InHand Electronics Inc. www.inhandelectronics.com products fingertip4 may be used. In addition to the PXA270 processor e.g. serving as the processor the Fingertip4 includes flash memory and SDRAM e.g. serving as local memory multiple serial ports a USB port and other I O interfaces e.g. to facilitate interfacing with one or more input devices and other components of the marking device supports a variety of wired and wireless interfaces WiFi Bluetooth GPS Ethernet any IEEE 802.11 interface or any other suitable wireless interface to facilitate implementation of the communication interface and connects to a wide variety of LCD displays to facilitate implementation of a user interface display .

Communication interface of marking device may be any wired and or wireless communication interface by which information may be exchanged between marking device and an external or remote device such as a remote computing device that is elsewhere in the dig area i.e. not a part of the marking device or outside the dig area. For example data that is provided by components of data acquisition system and or stored in local memory e.g. one or more electronic records may be transmitted via communication interface to a remote computer such as remote computer for processing. Examples of wired communication interfaces may include but are not limited to USB ports RS232 connectors RJ45 connectors Ethernet and any combination thereof. Examples of wireless communication interfaces may include but are not limited to an Intranet connection Internet Bluetooth technology Wi Fi Wi Max IEEE 802.11 technology e.g. operating at a minimum bandwidth of 54 Mbps or any other suitable bandwidth radio frequency RF Infrared Data Association IrDA compatible protocols Local Area Networks LAN Wide Area Networks WAN Shared Wireless Access Protocol SWAP any combination thereof and other types of wireless networking protocols. The wireless interface may be capable of capturing signals that reflect a user s intent. For example the wireless interface may include a microphone that can capture a user s intent by capturing the user s audible commands. Alternatively the wireless interface may interact with a device that monitors a condition of the user such as eye movement brain activity and or heart rate.

User interface of marking device may be any mechanism or combination of mechanisms by which a user may operate data acquisition system and by which information that is generated by data acquisition system may be presented to the user. For example user interface may include but is not limited to a display device including integrated displays and external displays such as Heads Up Displays HUD5 a touch screen one or more manual pushbuttons a microphone to provide for audible commands one or more light emitting diode LED indicators one or more toggle switches a keypad an audio output e.g. speaker buzzer and alarm and any combination thereof. In one implementation the user interface includes a menu on button to power up the marking device and provide a menu driven graphical user interface GUI displayed by the display device e.g. menu items and or icons displayed on the display device and navigated by the technician via a joystick or a set of four up down left right buttons as well as a select ok button to take some action pursuant to the selection of a menu item icon. As described below the display may also be used in some embodiments of the invention to display information relating to a placement of marking material in a dig area a location of an underground facility in a dig area or any other suitable information that may be displayed based on information acquired to create an electronic record .

In various embodiments the one or more interfaces of the marking device including the communication interface and user interface may be used as input devices to receive information to be stored in the memory as part of an electronic record of a marking operation. In some cases marking information received via the interface s e.g. via the communication interface may include ticket information regarding underground facilities to be marked during a marking operation. As another example using an interface such as the user interface service related information may be input including an identifier for the marking device used by the technician an identifier for a technician and or an identifier for the technician s employer. Alternatively some or all of the service related information similarly may be received via the communication interface and likewise some or all of the ticket information may be received via the user interface .

The actuation system of marking device shown in the block diagram of may include both electrical and mechanical elements according to various embodiments discussed in further detail below and for purposes of illustration is shown in as included as part of the control electronics . The actuation system may include a mechanical and or electrical actuator mechanism e.g. see the actuator shown in to provide one or more signals or stimuli as an input to the actuation system . Upon receiving one or more signals or stimuli e.g. actuation triggering by a locate technician or other user the actuation system causes marking material to be dispensed from marking dispenser . In various embodiments the actuation system may employ any of a variety of mechanical and or electrical techniques e.g. one or more switches or other circuit components a dedicated processor or the processor executing instructions one or more mechanical elements various types of transmitters and receivers or any combination of the foregoing as would be readily appreciated by those of skill in the relevant arts to cause the marking dispenser to dispense marking material in response to one or more signals or stimuli. The actuation system also provides one or more output signals in the form of an actuation signal to the processor to indicate one or more actuations of the marking device in response to which the processor may acquire collect various marking information and log data into the electronic record . Additional details of exemplary actuation system implementations are provided below in connection with .

In some embodiments the actuation system may be configured so as not to cause marking material to be dispensed from marking dispenser in response to one or more signals or stimuli rather the actuation system may merely facilitate a logging of data from one or more input devices in response to operation of an actuator trigger without necessarily dispensing marking material. In some instances this may facilitate simulation of a marking operation i.e. simulating the dispensing of marking material by providing an actuation signal to the processor indicating one or more simulated actuation events in response to which the processor may cause the logging of various data for creating an electronic record without any marking material actually being dispensed.

Location tracking system of marking device constitutes another type of input device that provides marking information and may include any device that can determine its geographical location to a certain degree of accuracy. For example location tracking system may include a global positioning system GPS receiver or a global navigation satellite system GNSS receiver. A GPS receiver may provide for example any standard format data stream such as a National Marine Electronics Association NMEA data stream or other data formats. An error correction component may be but is not limited to any mechanism for improving the accuracy of the geographic information provided by location tracking system for example error correction component may be an algorithm for correcting any offsets e.g. due to local disturbances in the atmosphere in the geo location data of location tracking system . While shown as part of a local location tracking system of the marking device error correction component alternatively may reside at a remote computing device such as remote computer . In other embodiments location tracking system may include any device or mechanism that may determine location by any other means such as performing triangulation by use of cellular radiotelephone towers.

In one exemplary implementation the location tracking system may include an ISM300F2 05 V0005 GPS module available from Inventek Systems LLC of Westford Mass. see www.inventeksys.com html ism300f2 c5 v0005.html . The Inventek GPS module includes two UARTs universal asynchronous receiver transmitter for communication with the processor supports both the SIRF Binary and NMEA 0183 protocols depending on firmware selection and has an information update rate of 5 Hz. A variety of geographic location information may be requested by the processor and provided by the GPS module to the processor including but not limited to time coordinated universal time UTC date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values and dilution of precision values. Accordingly it should be appreciated that in some implementations the location tracking system may provide a wide variety of geographic information as well as timing information e.g. one or more time stamps to the processor .

In another embodiment location tracking system may not reside locally on marking device . Instead location tracking system may reside on any on site computer which serves as a location reference point to which the location of marking device may be correlated by any other means such as but not limited to by a triangulation technique between the on site computer and marking device .

With respect to other input devices of the marking device that may provide marking information the control electronics may also include a timing system having an internal clock not shown such as a crystal oscillator device for processor . Additionally timing system may include a mechanism for registering time with a certain degree of accuracy e.g. accuracy to the minute second or millisecond and may also include a mechanism for registering the calendar date. In various implementations the timing system may be capable of registering the time and date using its internal clock or alternatively timing system may receive its time and date information from the location tracking system e.g. a GPS system or from an external timing system such as a remote computer or network via communication interface . In yet other implementations a dedicated timing system for providing timing information to be logged in an electronic record may be optional and timing information for logging into an electronic record may be obtained from the location tracking system e.g. GPS latitude and longitude coordinates with a corresponding time stamp . Timing information may include but is not limited to a period of time timestamp information date and or elapsed time.

Marking material detection mechanism of the marking device shown in is another type of input device that provides marking information and may be any mechanism or mechanisms for determining a presence or absence of a marking dispenser in or otherwise coupled to the marking device as well as determining certain attributes characteristics of the marking material within marking dispenser when the dispenser is placed in or coupled to the marking device. As shown in in some embodiments the marking material detection mechanism may be disposed generally in an area proximate to a marking material holder in which a marking dispenser may be placed.

For example in one embodiment the marking material detection mechanism may include one or more switch devices e.g. a make break single pole single throw contact switch disposed at one or more points along the marking material holder and electrically coupled to the processor . The switch device s may also be coupled to ground or a DC supply voltage such that when the switch device is in a first state e.g. closed making contact the ground or DC supply voltage is passed to the processor e.g. via an I O pin of the processor which provides an interrupt to or is periodically monitored by the processor and when the switch is in a second state e.g. open no contact the ground or DC supply voltage is not passed to the processor . When the marking dispenser is present in the holder the switch device s is in one of two possible states and when there is no marking dispenser the switch device s is in another of the two possible states e.g. the marking dispenser when present may depress the switch device s so as to make contact and pass the ground DC voltage to the processor . In this manner the marking material detection mechanism may provide a signal to the processor indicating the presence or absence of the marking dispenser in the marking device .

The marking material detection mechanism also or alternatively may include a barcode reader to read barcode data from a dispenser and or a radio frequency identification RFID reader for reading information from an RFID tag that is provided on marking dispenser . The RFID tag may include for example a unique serial number or universal product code UPC that corresponds to the brand and or type of marking material in marking dispenser . The type of information that may be encoded within the RFID tag on marking dispenser may include product specific information for the marking material but any information of interest may be stored on an RFID tag. For example user specific information and or inventory related information may be stored on each RFID tag for a marking dispenser to facilitate inventory tracking of marking materials. In particular an identifier for a technician may be stored on an RFID tag when the technician is provided with a marking dispenser and information relating to weight amount dispensed and or amount remaining may be written to the RFID tag whenever the marking dispenser is used.

In one exemplary implementation the marking material detection mechanism may include a Micro RWD MIFARE ICODE RFID reader module available from IB Technology Eccel Technology Ltd of Aylesbury Buckinghamshire UK see www.ibtechnology.co.uk products icode.htm . The Micro RWD reader module includes an RS232 communication interface to facilitate communication between the processor and the reader module e.g. via messages sent as a string of ASCII characters and supports both reading information from an RFID tag attached to a marking dispenser as well as writing information to an RFID tag attached to the marking dispenser. In one aspect of an exemplary implementation an antenna constituted by one or more turns of wire e.g. two turns of awg 26 wire 6.5 cm in diameter about 1 uH is coupled to the Micro RWD reader module and disposed in the marking material holder of the marking device see proximate to a marking dispenser when placed in the holder so as to capture close near field signals e.g. from an RFID tag on the dispenser within about 2 inches and exclude far field signals. In another aspect the Micro RWD reader module may be configured to read RFID tags having an ICODE SLI format e.g. ISO 15693 ICODE SLI . In yet another aspect an RFID tag may be affixed to an aerosol paint can serving as the marking dispenser such that the tag conforms to a plastic cap of the paint can and is disposed at a particular location relative to a notch in the cap e.g. 90 degrees 15 degrees from the notch that allows access to the spray nozzle of the can and is in a relatively predictable position substantially aligned with the antenna when the paint can is placed in the marking material holder . Examples of RFID tags suitable for this purpose are available from BCS Solutions Inc. see www.bcssolutions.com solutions rfid and include but are not limited to the HF Bullseye Wet Inlay SLA Round 40.

In yet other embodiments marking material detection mechanism may alternatively or further be configured to detect properties of marking material as it is dispensed. For example the marking material detection mechanism may include one or more of an optical sensor an olfactory sensor an auditory sensor e.g. a microphone a weight sensor and any combination thereof. For example in one embodiment an optical sensor in the marking device may be used to identify the composition and or type of marking material in the marking dispenser by analyzing light reflected by the material as it is dispensed. Similarly an olfactory sensor may be used to identify one or more characteristics of the marking material based on an odor profile of the material and an auditory sensor may be used to identify the difference between paint being sprayed from an aerosol can and aerosol without paint being sprayed from a can e.g. as the dispenser becomes emptied of paint .

In one embodiment information provided by one or more input devices of the marking device e.g. the timing system the location tracking system the marking material detection mechanism the user interface the communication interface is acquired and logged stored in memory upon actuation of the actuation system e.g. triggering an actuator . Some embodiments of the invention may additionally or alternatively acquire log information from one or more input devices at one or more times during or throughout an actuation such as when a technician is holding a mechanical or electrical actuator for some period of time and moving to dispense marking material in a line e.g. see . In various aspects of such embodiments marking information derived from one or more input devices may be collected at a start time of an actuation at one or more times during an actuation and in some cases at regular intervals during an actuation e.g. several times per second once per second once every few seconds . Further some marking information may be collected at an end of an actuation such as time information that may indicate a duration of an actuation.

Additionally it should be appreciated that while some marking information may be received via one or more input devices at the start of each marking operation and upon successive actuations of the marking device in other cases some marking information may be collected by or provided to the marking device once prior to a marking operation e.g. on power up or reset of the marking device as part of an electronic instruction or dispatch by a locate company and or in response to a request query from a locate technician and stored in local memory for later incorporation into an electronic record. For example prior to a given marking operation and one or more actuations of the marking device ticket information and or service related information may have already been received e.g. via the communication interface and or user interface and stored in local memory . Upon generation of an electronic record of a given marking operation information previously received via the interface s may be retrieved from the local memory if stored there initially and entered into an electronic record in some case together with information collected pursuant to one or more actuations of the marking device. Alternatively ticket information and or service related information may be received via the interface s and stored in an entry in the electronic record directly in response to one or more actuations of the marking device e.g. without being first stored in local memory .

In sum according to embodiments of the present invention various marking information from one or more input devices regardless of how or when it is received may be stored in an electronic record of a marking operation in which at least some of the marking information is logged pursuant to one or more actuations of the marking device.

In one embodiment the optional remote computer of the data acquisition system may be a centralized computer such as a central server of an underground facility locate service provider. In another embodiment remote computer may be a computer that is at or near the work site i.e. on site e.g. a computer that is present in a locate technician s vehicle.

Whether resident and or executed on either the marking device or the remote computer as noted above the marking data algorithm includes a set of processor executable instructions e.g. stored in memory such as local memory of the marking device that when executed by processor of the marking device or another processor processes information e.g. various marking information collected in response to e.g. during one or more actuations of the marking device and or in some cases before or after a given actuation or series of actuations. As also discussed above according to various embodiments the actuations of marking device may effect both dispensing marking material and logging of marking information or merely logging of marking information for other purposes e.g. simulating the dispensing of marking material without dispensing marking material. In either situation marking data algorithm when executed by the processor may cause the processor to perform collection logging storage creation of electronic records and in some instances further processing and analysis of various marking information with respect to marking device actuations. For example as discussed in further detail below in connection with the operations of marking data algorithm as effected by the processor may include but are not limited to the following 

It should also be appreciated that the marking data algorithm may include one or more adjustable parameters that govern various aspects of the collection and logging of marking information e.g. the rate at which various marking information is collected from one or more input devices and that these parameters may be adjusted or set for example by an administrator at a remote computer after which the marking data algorithm is downloaded to the marking device for execution by the processor . Alternatively in other implementations adjustable parameters of a marking data algorithm already resident on a marking device may in some cases be adjusted remotely via the communication interface or locally via the user interface.

While the functionality of various components of the marking device was discussed above in connection with shows some structural aspects of the marking device according to one embodiment. For example the marking device may include an elongated housing in which is disposed one or more elements of the actuation system one or more elements of the control electronics and the power source . Elongated housing may be hollow or may contain certain cavities or molded compartments for installing any components therein such as the various components of marking device that are shown in . The elongated housing and other structural elements associated with the housing as discussed below may be formed of any rigid semi rigid strong and lightweight material such as but not limited to molded plastic and aluminum.

Incorporated at a proximal end of elongated housing may be a handle which provides a convenient grip by which the user e.g. the locate technician may carry the marking device during use i.e. the exemplary marking device depicted in is intended to be a hand held device . In one implementation the power source may be provided in the form of a removable battery pack housing one or more rechargeable batteries that are connected in series or parallel in order to provide a DC voltage to marking device and disposed within a compartment in the handle . Such an arrangement facilitates use of conventional removable rechargeable battery packs often employed in a variety of cordless power tools in which the battery pack similarly is situated in a handle of the tool. It should be appreciated however that the power source in the form of a battery pack may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .

As also shown in mounted near handle is user interface which may include a display . The display may be a touch screen display to facilitate interaction with a user technician and or the user interface also may include one or more buttons switches joysticks a keyboard and the like to facilitate entry of information by a user technician. One or more elements of the control electronics e.g. the processor memory communication interface and timing system also may be located in the proximal end of the elongated housing in the vicinity of the user interface and display . As with the power source it should be appreciated that one or more elements of the control electronics may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .

In the embodiment of the location tracking system similarly may be positioned on the proximal end of the elongated housing to facilitate substantially unobstructed exposure to the atmosphere in particular as illustrated in the location tracking system may be situated on an a ground plane providing an electrical ground at least at the antenna frequency of the location tracking system e.g. at approximately 1.5 GHz that extends from the proximal end of the housing and is approximately parallel to the ground surface or pavement when the marking device is being normally operated by a technician so as to reduce signal modulation with subtle movements of the marking device .

As also shown in incorporated at the distal end of elongated housing is a marking dispenser holder for holding one or more marking dispensers e.g. an aerosol paint canister . Dispenser may be one or more replaceable dispensers or one or more reusable refillable dispensers including a fixed reservoir forming a part of the device or any other suitable dispenser. Also situated at the distal end of the housing is the marking material detection mechanism to detect a presence or absence of the marking dispenser in the marking material holder and or one or more characteristics of the marking material as well as an actuation mechanism which in some implementations may constitute part of the actuation system and be employed to interact with the marking dispenser so as to effect dispensing of the marking material .

With respect to the actuation system as shown in at least a portion of the actuation system is indicated generally along the length of the elongated housing for purposes of illustration. More specifically however in various implementations the actuation system may include multiple components disposed in various places in on or coupled to the marking device . For example in the embodiment of the actuation system includes an actuator which for example may be a mechanical mechanism provided at the handle in the form of a trigger that is pulled by a finger or hand of an user technician. The actuation system further includes the actuation mechanism disposed at the distal end of the marking device that is responsive to the actuator to dispense marking material. In general in various exemplary implementations as discussed in further detail below the actuation system may employ any of a variety of mechanical and or electrical techniques to cause the marking dispenser to dispense marking material in response to one or more signals or stimuli. In the embodiment shown in the signal stimulus is initially provided to the actuation system via the mechanical actuator i.e. a locate technician or other user triggers e.g. pulls depresses the actuator to provide a signal stimulus to the actuation system which in turn operates the actuation mechanism to dispense marking material in response to the signal stimulus.

In response to the signal stimulus provided by the actuator as discussed above the actuation system may also provide an actuation signal to the processor to indicate an actuation. As discussed in further detail below in connection with pursuant to the execution by the processor of the marking data algorithm the actuation signal may be used to cause the logging of information that is provided by one or more components of the marking device so as to generate an electronic record of the marking operation.

In one implementation the sensor may include a switch device e.g. a make break single pole single throw contact switch disposed along the handle of the marking device such that when pulled the actuator contacts e.g. depresses the switch causing a state of the switch to toggle. In another implementation the sensor may include a switch device such as a reed magnetic switch disposed at some point along the length of the elongated housing in such an implementation the mechanical coupler may have a magnet disposed along it at an appropriate position relative to the reed switch such that movement of the mechanical coupler upon actuation of the actuator causes a state of the reed switch to toggle. Electrically a switch device serving as the sensor may be coupled to ground or a DC supply voltage such that when the switch device is in a first state e.g. closed making contact the ground or DC supply voltage is passed to the processor e.g. via an I O pin of the processor which provides an interrupt to or is periodically monitored by the processor and when the switch is in a second state e.g. open no contact the ground or DC supply voltage is not passed to the processor . In this manner the sensor may provide the actuation signal to the processor indicating actuation and release of the actuator .

Other examples of transmitter link receiver combinations include but are not limited to an acoustic transmitter link receiver e.g. a sound wave source that provides a sound wave of a certain tone duration and or amplitude when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding sound wave detector an optical transmitter link receiver e.g. a light or laser source that provides an optical signal of a certain wavelength duration and or amplitude when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding optical detector a fluid transmitter link receiver e.g. a fluid system that provides a fluid control output of a certain volume pressure and or duration when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding fluid sensor for sensing the presence of for example a short blast of water of a certain volume pressure and or duration to indicate an actuation the fluid system may be for example a closed loop system that has a source reservoir at the top of the marking device a fluid line in proximity with the fluid sensor a return reservoir for capturing water during the actuation process and appropriate pressure regulation and ducts for cycling water from the return reservoir back to the source reservoir and an air transmitter link receiver e.g. an air system that provides an air control output of a certain volume pressure and or duration when the actuator is actuated and a corresponding air sensor for sensing the presence of for example a blast or puff of air of a certain volume pressure and or duration to indicate an actuation .

While not explicitly shown in in yet other embodiments it should be appreciated that the sensor may be coupled to the processor to provide the actuation signal representing actuation release of the actuator and in turn the processor may provide a signal to the link transmitter such that dispensing of marking material may in part be under the control of the processor executing particular instructions for this purpose. More specifically while in some implementations dispensing of marking material may be directly responsive to actuation of the actuator and cease upon release of the actuator in other implementations dispensing of marking material may be initiated in some manner upon actuation of the actuator but then continued dispensing of marking material may not necessarily be dictated by continued actuation or release of the actuator. Rather the processor may provide one or more signals or commands to the link transmitter to govern dispensing of marking material in some manner that does not necessarily track each actuation and release of the actuator.

For example in one implementation the processor may execute instructions such that once the actuation signal from the sensor indicates actuation of the actuator the processor provides a signal to the link transmitter that causes dispensing of marking material for some predetermined or user defined amount of time irrespective of release of the actuator. Additionally or alternatively the processor may provide one or more signals to the link transmitter that causes dispensing of marking material for multiple discrete amounts of time with a single actuation e.g. three bursts of 1 second each per actuation . From the foregoing it should be generally appreciated that a wide variety of marker sizes and patterns may be generated from the marking device in an automated or semi automated manner based on processor based control of the actuation system . It should also be appreciated that automated or semi automated processor based control of the dispensing of marking material may also govern in some fashion how how often and or what type of marking information is collected and logged to generate an electronic record of a marking operation as discussed further below in connection with .

Referring now to a perspective view of marking device when in use for marking a lines pattern is presented. In marking operations a lines pattern is typically the end product of a marking operation. This pattern extends the dotting pattern e.g. dotting pattern of so as to create lines e.g. a series of dashes that indicate the presence or absence of an underground facility. These lines subsequently provide important reference marks to an excavator so as to avoid damage to a facility during excavation activities or other disturbances of the ground. By way of example shows underground facility which may be any concealed facility such as an underground gas line water pipe sewer pipe power line telephone line cable television conduit and the like. also shows a lines pattern that is formed by multiple locate marks dispensed via marking device . A characteristic of locate marks of lines pattern is that each locate mark is formed by an extended burst of marking material e.g. a longer actuation of the marking device as compared with a dotting pattern. As with the dotting pattern shown in however each locate mark of the lines pattern shown in may correspond to one actuation of marking device . In some alternative implementations as discussed above a series of locate marks e.g. all three marks may be automatically generated by one actuation of marking device pursuant to processor based control of the actuation system.

In one embodiment of the present invention for generating an electronic record of a marking operation the processor of the marking device executing the marking data algorithm may collect various marking information and generate an electronic record having one or more actuation data sets respectively associated with one or more actuations act act act . . . act n and corresponding locate marks as shown in . Marking information may be collected and entered into such an electronic record at various times relative to the start time t and the end time t of a given actuation e.g. at t only at t only at both t and t at any time s between t and t and or before or after t and t.

Examples of marking information that generally but not necessarily is acquired with respect to t and t of each actuation and points between t and t actuation data may include but are not limited to 

Examples of marking information that may be acquired before during or after a given actuation or succession of actuations and also entered into an electronic record include but are not limited to 

In exemplary methods for generating an electronic record of marking operations according to some embodiments of the invention as discussed in greater detail below for a given actuation the processor may request the location tracking system to provide geographic information at one or more times during the actuation e.g. periodically at regular intervals . Thus an actuation data set of an electronic record for a given actuation of the marking device may have multiple pieces of geographic information and associated time stamps representing the location of the marking device at multiple times during a corresponding actuation. Additionally for a given actuation the processor also may request the marking material detection mechanism to provide marking material information as part of the actuation data set. The processor also may include ticket information and service related information which may be collected e.g. via one or more of the user interface and the communication interface before a corresponding actuation stored in memory and retrieved from the memory for entry into the electronic record upon or during the corresponding actuation or collected and entered into the electronic record upon or during the corresponding actuation.

While the collection and logging of marking information to generate an electronic record is discussed in some aspects for purposes of illustration in terms of actuation data sets i.e. a set of data that is associated and logged with a corresponding actuation of the marking device it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect. More generally an electronic record of a marking operation may be generated in any of a variety of manners have a variety of file formats and or data structures and include any of a variety of marking information some of which may be germane to one or more actuations of the marking device and some of which may be common to multiple actuations or the overall marking operation in general .

In block of the process shown in ticket information and or service related information may be received e.g. via one or more of the user interface and the communication interface of marking device and this information optionally may be stored in whole or in part in local memory of the marking device. The ticket information and or service related information may be received electronically in any of a variety of formats and the processor may be configured to appropriately parse the information for subsequent entry into an electronic record.

In some embodiments the ticket information may be received as part of an electronic locate request ticket and individual respective pieces of ticket information e.g. ticket number work site address information requesting party etc. may be extracted or derived from the electronic locate request ticket. In other embodiments various aspects of ticket information may be input by a user technician via the user interface.

For example in block the process may provide for the entry of any of a variety of text information for inclusion in an electronic record and or selection by a user technician e.g. via the user interface of various information to be included in an electronic record as part of ticket information and or service related information . One example of such information may relate to a ground type in and around the work site dig area at which marking material is dispensed as part of the marking operation. In some implementations a text description of the ground type may be entered and stored as part of the electronic record. In another exemplary implementation the processor controls the user interface including display so as to display information to the technician to facilitate such a selection. In particular a ground type selection submenu may be displayed including one or more categories of ground types displayed in any of a variety of manners e.g. as a list of text entries an arrangement of icons symbolizing respective categories labeled symbols etc. . Examples of ground type categories that may be displayed in such a submenu include but are not limited to 1 Pavement 2 Grass 3 Rough Rocky 4 Dirt 5 Gravel Sand and 6 Other. More generally any number and variety of ground type categories may be presented to the technician via the user interface in alphabetically ordered lists numerically ordered lists or other types of ordered text based or symbolic arrangements for example. In yet another exemplary implementation the user interface may include a microphone and the processor may be configured to accept and process audible commands such that a ground type category may be accomplished via voice activated commands by simply speaking into the microphone.

Similarly with respect to service related information a user technician may manually enter some aspects of this information via the user interface display while other aspects may already be available in other memory locations e.g. the marking device ID or serial number a technician ID to which the marking device is assigned or checked out etc. and or may be received electronically.

While block is illustrated as one element of the process it should be appreciated that respective pieces of information received as input in block may be received at different times and via different interfaces sources and thus may occur at different points in the process . It should also be appreciated that block is an optional step in the process and that more generally a process for collecting marking information to generate an electronic record need not necessarily include collection of one or both of ticket information and service related information.

In block the locate technician utilizes the user interface to indicate the initiation of a marking operation. For example the technician may press a button operate a joy stick or touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface to commence a marking operation. In response a job initiation signal is provided to the processor e.g. via a switch closure and a ground or DC level applied to an I O pin of the processor or by the user interface providing a signal to the processor to initiate generation of an electronic record. Alternatively a remote job initiation signal may be received by the processor via the communication interface from another device such as the remote computer .

In response to the job initiation signal in block the processor opens a file in the memory in which to store the electronic record and assigns a file identifier to the opened file. In one example the file identifier assigned to the opened file may be or include one or more of a job number job ID or ticket number derived from the ticket information and or the service related information an identifier for the marking device itself and an identifier for a remote computer associated with the marking device e.g. for either remote control operation of the device and or data uploading downloading . To this end if ticket information and or service related information is not previously available e.g. if no information is received in block the technician optionally may be prompted to manually enter e.g. via a wizard or sequence of dialogues germane to obtaining relevant information displayed on the display of the user interface various elements of ticket information and or service related information from which a file identifier may be derived or provide other information that may be used as a file identifier.

A file opened in block for purposes of storing an electronic record may have any of a variety of formats and include any of a variety of data structures. In one embodiment the processor initially opens up a flat file for collection and logging of marking information to facilitate generation of an electronic record. As known in the art a flat file is a plain text or mixed text binary file containing one entry data record per line in which each entry may have multiple fields containing respective values and wherein the respective values may be separated by delimiters e.g. commas or have a fixed length. In one exemplary implementation the processor logs data into a flat file opened for the electronic record as a succession of time stamped event entries. Some event entries may be related specifically to actuation and or logged in response to actuation of the marking device e.g. the processor receiving an actuation signal . Other event entries may be more generally related in some manner to overall operation of the marking device or the marking operation itself but not necessarily associated with one or more particular actuations e.g. start pause stop marking operation power battery status communication link network connection status etc. and these other event entries may be logged at virtually any time in some cases irrespective of one or more actuations .

Accordingly it should be appreciated that in one aspect of this embodiment a flat file for an electronic record may contain a succession of time stamped event entries on respective lines in which one or more event entries may have multiple delimited fields values and at least some of the event entries relate to actuation of the marking device. In another aspect one or more fields values in a given event entry may specifically indicate in some manner whether or not the event is associated with an actuation of the marking device. In general an actuation event entry constitutes an entry in a file for an electronic record that is in some manner specifically related to and or logged in response to or during actuation of the marking device and multiple actuation event entries for a given actuation constitute an actuation data set for that actuation. Again it should be appreciated that a file for an electronic record may include one or more other event entries that may not be particularly associated with an actuation.

In other embodiments the file for an electronic record may or may not be a flat file and event entries associated with actuations actuation event entries may be somehow identified and differentiated from other event entries that are not associated with an actuation. For example a file for an electronic record may include a particular data structure or format that segregates or separates in some manner event entries associated with successive actuations from those event entries that are not particularly associated with actuations and or may be common to multiple actuations or a group of actuations . In yet other embodiments as discussed below marking information may be initially collected and logged in a first file for an electronic record in a first format e.g. a flat file including a succession of time stamped event entries as raw data for the marking operation that may be stored and or transmitted for any of a variety of purposes and then reformatted and or reorganized in some manner in one or more subsequent files e.g. a file having a particular data structure that segregates separates actuation related information from other information in different fields elements of a data structure for archiving and or transmission to one or more other devices processors.

Once a file for an electronic record is opened in block in block the processor can begin collecting and logging various marking information i.e. logging in the electronic record and or transmitting via the communication interface actuation event entries and or other event entries. In one exemplary implementation the processor may be programmed so as to poll one or more input devices and or other components of the marking device to receive information either once or multiple times periodically following the job initiation signal and log responses to these polls polling events as event entries with associated time stamps. Examples of entries corresponding to polling events that may be logged into the file for the electronic record and or transmitted include but are not limited to one or more power status event entries including power information associated with the power source one or more ticket information event entries including ticket information e.g. as received from the user interface or the communication interface retrieved from local memory etc. one or more service related information event entries including the service related information e.g. as received from the user interface or the communication interface retrieved from local memory etc. and one or more communication interface event entries including status information regarding operation of the communication interface e.g. network communication available unavailable .

Additionally or alternatively the processor may be programmed so as to respond to one or more signals designated as interrupt events from one or more components of the marking device. Such interrupt events cause logging of information in the electronic record and or transmission of information upon following the processor detecting the corresponding signal s . For example the job initiation signal itself may constitute an interrupt event in response to which the processor not only opens a file for the electronic record but once the file is opened the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log into the electronic record a start job event entry including a job initiation time stamp associated with receipt of the job initiation signal.

In a similar manner following commencement of a marking operation the locate technician may utilize the user interface e.g. press a button operate a joy stick or touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface to pause restart and or indicate completion of the marking operation and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example as indicated in block of a pause signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a pause job event entry including a pause job time stamp associated with the at least one pause signal. When the technician is ready to continue as shown in block of the technician may indicate this via the user interface and a restart job event entry similarly may be logged. When the marking operation is deemed by the technician to be completed as noted in block of the technician may utilize the user interface so as to provide a stop signal to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a stop job event entry including a stop job time stamp associated with the stop signal.

Additionally the locate technician may utilize the user interface to denote the beginning and end of a marking operation for a particular facility type and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example upon beginning a marking operation for a given facility type the technician may select line start from the user interface and a corresponding line start signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a line start event entry. Similarly when the technician wishes to indicate completion of the marking operation for a given facility type the technician may select line stop from the user interface and a corresponding line stop signal may be provided by the user interface to the processor in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a line stop even entry. 

While various events are noted above as examples of polling events as opposed to interrupt events it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited in these respects and that the marking data algorithm executed by the processor may be configured in any of a variety manners to designate various functions performed by and or information provided by various components of the marking device as polling events or interrupt events. For example the power source may be configured to provide a low battery signal to the processor which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event that may be logged by the processor and or that may cause the processor to take some particular action e.g. provide an audible visible alert disable logging of further data etc. . In one aspect absent the low battery signal the processor may request status information from the power source once or occasionally as a polling event. Similarly the communication interface may be configured to provide a no network connection available signal to the processor which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event that is logged and or causes the processor to take some action and when not present the processor may poll the communication interface to request status information as a polling event.

Another example of an interrupt event is given by the actuation signal provided by the actuation system upon actuation of the actuator i.e. a signal change of state indicating a transition from a non actuated state to an actuated state in response to which the processor logs one or more actuation event entries in the electronic record. More specifically in one implementation the receipt of a non actuated to actuated transition state of the actuation signal by the processor may cause an initial actuation event entry to be logged as a start actuation event entry having an associated time stamp i.e. a start time for the corresponding actuation and also cause the processor to subsequently poll one or more input devices for information during the corresponding actuation and until release of the actuator i.e. subsequent change of state of the actuation signal . In this manner an actuation data set for a given actuation may include multiple actuation event entries.

For example during actuation of the actuator the processor may poll the location tracking system so as to receive geographic information and in turn log one or more geo location data event entries in the actuation data set for the corresponding actuation. As discussed above in connection with in one exemplary implementation the location tracking system is configured to provide geographic information at an information update rate of approximately 5 Hz and the processor may log respective updates of geographic information provided by the location tracking system at this update rate during an actuation as multiple geo location data event entries of the actuation data set. It should be appreciated however that methods and apparatus according to various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect and that other geographic information update rates may be employed in various implementations e.g. update rates of up to approximately 100 Hz based in part on the particular location tracking system employed. Furthermore it should be appreciated that in some implementations the geographic information provided by the location tracking system may include one or more longitude coordinates latitude coordinates and a corresponding geo location data time stamp at which a given set of longitude latitude coordinates are obtained by the location tracking system accordingly a given geo location data event entry in an actuation data set may include a longitude coordinate a latitude coordinate and the corresponding geo location data time stamp.

Similarly in some implementations pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the timing system and the marking material detection mechanism so as to receive timing information and or marking material information during a corresponding actuation and in turn log one or more of a timing event entry and a marking material detection event entry as part of the actuation data set. Any of a variety of marking material information as discussed above may be collected and logged during actuation in response to processor polling of the marking material detection mechanism e.g. causing an RFID tag reader to read various information from an RFID tag affixed to the marking dispenser .

Additionally in some implementations pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the user interface the communication interface and the local memory to retrieve ticket information and or service related information for logging into an actuation data set. As discussed above in some implementations the receipt retrieval of ticket information and or service related information may be treated as a polling event not necessarily associated with actuations and this information need not be included in one or more actuation data sets. However in other implementations it may be desirable to include at least some aspect of ticket information and or service related information in each actuation data set notwithstanding the possible redundancy of data content in respective actuation data sets e.g. see Table 6 discussed further below in connection with .

Another example of an interrupt event is given by a change of state of the actuation signal indicating a transition from the actuated state to the non actuated state i.e. release of the actuator . In response to this event the processor may request information from the timing system and log an end actuation event entry including an end time stamp.

Yet another type of interrupt event causing the processor to log one or more event entries may be provided by the marking material detection mechanism in the form of a signal that indicates whether or not a marking dispenser is contained in or appropriately coupled to the marking device. To this end as discussed above in connection with the marking material detection mechanism may include a toggle switch that provides a two state signal to the processor e.g. dispenser in dispenser out as an interrupt. Upon receiving an interrupt indicating a transition from dispenser out to dispenser in the processor may collect and log this event as a dispenser in event entry with a corresponding time stamp and then request other marking material information relating to the marking material in the dispenser from the marking material detection mechanism. In view of the foregoing it should be appreciated that in some embodiments marking material information may not necessarily be collected during one or more actuations of the marking device but alternatively may be collected only upon a dispenser in event being detected. Upon detection of an interrupt event indicating a transition from dispenser in to dispenser out the processor similarly may collect and log this event as a dispenser out event entry. 

In yet another embodiment the processor executing marking data algorithm may be configured to repeatedly regularly poll all available input devices and other components of the marking device e.g. in a predetermined order in response to receipt of the job initiation signal and generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets including marking information received pursuant to these polling events. In one aspect of this embodiment each data packet of marking information may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. For example in one implementation the header for each packet may include one or more of a job ID e.g. ticket identifier technician ID device ID e.g. serial number packet type ID and or a time stamp corresponding to logging of information generation of the packet. Each packet also may include one or more payload fields for carrying information provided by the polled device s or components and one or more flag fields that are set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. pull depress actuator release actuator marking dispenser in marking dispenser out low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of the actuator tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the marking device in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

Table 1 below illustrates an example of a portion of the contents of a relatively simple flat file for an electronic record that may be generated by the process of 

As noted above it should be appreciated that the portion of the file shown in Table 1 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and that the format and or content for respective event entries and the file itself for an electronic record generated by and or based on the information collection process discussed above in connection with may have any of a variety of different formats and or content.

To this point Tables 2 through 5 below provide examples of various events for which event entries may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the marking device exemplary formats for these event entries and exemplary file formats for files having multiple such entries according to another embodiment of the present invention.

Job Started Paused Restarted Completed Events This event entry format provides information about when a marking operation job was started and completed in addition to capturing details about if and when the job was paused and restarted.

Actuation State Change Events For purposes of this event format the actuator is deemed to have three possible states i.e. PRESSED HELD and RELEASED. Marking information from one or more input devices other components of the marking device is recorded with these events to provide information about the job in progress.

Marking Device Status Events The status event collects various marking information and or information on operating characteristics of the device on a periodic basis while a job is in progress e.g. pursuant to processor polls .

Error Events Should any input device or other component of the marking device encounter a significant error condition this may be logged as an event. In some cases the user technician also may be notified of the error through the user interface visible alert on display audible alarm alert etc. . Similar event formats may be adopted for warning alerts events and informational alerts events.

With respect to file formats for electronic records including the event entries outlined above in Tables 2 through 5 two exemplary file formats namely ASCII and XML are provided below for purposes of illustration. In various implementations a given marking device may be particularly configured to store and or transmit electronic records and respective entries therein in either format or other formats . With respect to identification of files electronic records a standard naming scheme format may be adopted for example including an identifier for the remote computer with which the marking device may be communicating ServerID an identifier for the marking device itself WandID and an identifier for the marking operation job JobID and having the format ServerID WandID Job ID. 

ASCII Data Format This format allows low level remote processing engines to quickly and easily receive parse and react to marking information logged and or transmitted by the marking device. An example of an electronic record formatted in ASCII based on the event entries outlined in Tables 2 through 5 is as follows 

XML Data Format This format allows transmission of self describing data elements from the marking device in some instances reducing processing errors and reducing the risks and effort involved in upgrades and data changes. An example of an electronic record formatted in XML based on the event entries outlined in Tables 2 through 5 is as follows 

Yet another alternative format for storing and organizing marking information in an electronic record of a marking operation according to one embodiment of the invention is shown in Table 6 below. By way of example Table 6 shows the format and content of three actuation data sets of an electronic record of a marking operation for a given facility in which each actuation data set includes information associated with multiple actuation event entries logged during a corresponding actuation and resulting locate mark e.g. act act and act as shown for example in . As discussed above it should be appreciated that the format and content shown below in Table 6 may constitute an original electronic record generated by the processor pursuant to the process shown in or may be derived from raw data collected and logged pursuant to the process e.g. as a flat file an ASCII formatted file or an XML formatted file and subsequently reorganized and particularly formatted.

In addition to the information shown in Table 6 a job ID or some other identifier for the electronic record as a whole e.g. a ticket number as well as a total number of actuations for a given marking operation e.g. the total number of actuation data sets in a given electronic record in this embodiment may be included in the electronic record.

With regard to color information that may be included in any of the event entries and electronic records discussed herein Table 7 below shows an example of the correlation of marking material color to the type of facility to be marked.

The data structure of the actuation data set C of the electronic record shown in includes a start location field corresponding to T1 geo location data shown in Table 2 an end location field corresponding to T2 geo location data shown in Table 2 a start time field corresponding to T1 timestamp data shown in Table 2 an end time field corresponding to T2 timestamp data shown in Table 2 and a duration field corresponding to the duration t shown in Table 2 . Additionally the data structure for entry C includes one or more fields A B . . . N for intermediate location data corresponding to 1interval location data 2interval location data . . . Nth interval location data shown in Table 2 . Finally the data structure for the entry C may include one or more ticket information fields e.g. corresponding to Locate request data in Table 2 and one or more service related information fields e.g. corresponding to Service provider ID User ID and Device ID in Table 2 .

In addition to one or more actuation data sets corresponding to actuations of a marking device the electronic record shown in may include one or more additional elements. For example shows an additional element of the electronic record to store the total number of entries in the record. Furthermore according to another embodiment various other information that may be common to multiple or all actuation data sets of a given electronic record may be stored in one or more additional elements of the electronic record that are not contained within one or more of the actuation data sets themselves. For example in one alternative implementation one or more of the ticket information field the service related information field and the marking material properties field which are shown as part of the data structure for a given actuation data set of the electronic record may instead be elements of the electronic record that are not included within any one actuation data set e.g. the information contained in one or more of the ticket information field and the service related information field may be common to all actuation data sets of a given electronic record .

In yet another embodiment of the present invention the marking device shown in may be configured e.g. via particular instructions included in the marking data algorithm executing on the processor and or various hardware modifications to operate in multiple different modes so as to collect various information relating not only to a marking operation itself marking information but additionally or alternatively various information relating to the work site dig area in which the marking operation is performed. For example in one implementation the marking device may be configured to operate in a first marking mode which essentially follows various aspects of the process outlined in and also operate in a second landmark identification mode or more simply landmark mode in which the marking device acquires information relating to one or more environmental landmarks that may be germane to the marking operation e.g. in and around the work site dig area and or generally in the vicinity of the marking operation .

More specifically in a marking mode marking material may be dispensed with respective actuations of the marking device and various information transmitted and or stored in an electronic record attendant to this process as discussed above. Alternatively in a landmark mode marking material is not necessarily dispensed with an actuation of the marking device and in some instances the dispensing of marking material is specifically precluded instead a technician positions the marking device proximate to an environmental landmark of interest and upon actuation the marking device collects various information about the landmark hereafter referred to as landmark information which information may include but is not limited to geo location data of an environmental landmark type of environmental landmark and a time stamp for any acquired information relating to an environmental landmark.

More specifically as shown in in this embodiment the marking device further includes a mode selector device in the form of a bypass device that is operated so as to impact and deflect the mechanical coupler of the actuation system such that the mechanical coupler fails to cause the dispensing of a marking material upon actuation of the actuator . In the bypass device is shown in a first state e.g. released which allows the marking device to operate in marking mode as described above i.e. the mechanical coupler is allowed to be displaced essentially vertically with actuation of the actuator and thereby dispense markers . In the bypass device is shown in a second state e.g. depressed which allows the marking device to operate in landmark mode in particular the mechanical coupler is deflected by the bypass device such that upon actuation of the actuator the mechanical coupler is not displaced vertically. In one example with reference again to when the mechanical coupler is deflected by the bypass device actuations of the actuator do not effect full essentially up down vertical movement of the mechanical coupler as a result the mechanical coupler fails to displace the actuation mechanism and no pressure is applied to the spray nozzle of a paint dispenser or dispensing mechanism of other types of marker dispensers . At the same time however actuation of the actuator nonetheless provides an actuation signal to the processor which may provide for logging of an actuation event entry as discussed above .

In various implementations the bypass device may be a locking and or spring loaded switching device e.g. a press release locking thumb switch appropriately positioned along the housing of the marking device e.g. near or on the handle wherein the bypass device provides for both deflection of the mechanical coupler as well as opening closure of electrical contacts so as to provide a mode signal to the processor . For example as shown in the first state released of the bypass device may include an open contact state and no deflection of the mechanical coupler whereas the second state shown in depressed may include a closed contact state e.g. in which the mode signal is provided to the processor as an interrupt event to indicate landmark mode when the bypass device deflects the mechanical coupler .

In response to the mode signal indicating landmark mode the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log into an electronic record a landmark mode event entry including a landmark mode time stamp associated with the landmark mode signal. Additionally or alternatively the processor may respond to the landmark mode signal by taking one or more other actions pursuant to execution of a portion of the marking data algorithm including particular instructions to implement the landmark mode such as providing for the selection of landmark categories and or types via the user interface and menus provided on the display and logging actuation event entries in an electronic record as landmark event entries. Further details of landmark mode operation of the marking device are discussed below in connection with .

In another exemplary implementation rather than employing the bypass device shown in as a mode selector device a marking device configured to implement a landmark mode in which no marker or marking material is dispensed may be modified to include an actuator locking device as a mode selector device to prevent operation of the actuator . In essence such a device would function in a manner similar to a trigger lock. Like the bypass device the actuator locking device or trigger lock may not only mechanically impede operation of the actuator but also include electrical switch contacts opened closed so as to provide a mode signal to the processor to indicate a landmark mode when the actuator locking device is engaged to impede actuation. Because such an actuator locking device impedes operation of the actuator the actuator itself cannot be employed to provide an actuation signal to the processor to facilitate the logging into an electronic record of actuation event entries as landmark event entries. Accordingly in implementations involving an actuator locking device another aspect of the user interface e.g. a button switch portion of the touch screen display microphone to provide for voice activation etc. is employed to provide a signal to the processor to facilitate logging of an event e.g. a landmark event by the technician. Further details of logging of landmark events are discussed below in connection with .

Yet another exemplary implementation of a marking device modified to operate in landmark mode is based on the general implementation of an actuation system shown in in which the landmark mode is selected via the user interface and or display e.g. menu driven GUI rather than via a bypass device or actuator locking device i.e. some functionality of the user interface itself provides for a mode selector device. With reference again to dispensing of marking material in this implementation is controlled by a link transmitter . As discussed above in connection with the link transmitter may be responsive to the actuation signal provided by sensor with operation of the actuator for example or alternatively responsive to a signal provided by the processor such that dispensing of marking material may in part be under the control of the processor executing particular instructions for this purpose . Accordingly in this implementation when a landmark mode is selected via the user interface the marking device may be configured to either dispense marking material by not impeding any control signals to the link transmitter e.g. so as to form one or more landmark locate marks on or near a target environmental landmark or not to dispense marking material by impeding control signals to the link transmitter or otherwise controlling the link transmitter to not dispense marking material . In either case the actuation signal output by sensor may nonetheless be provided to the processor so as to facilitate logging of an actuation event entry upon actuation of the actuator which in landmark mode may be designated as a landmark event entry as discussed further below in connection with .

In the process outlined in following commencement of a marking operation the locate technician may utilize the user interface e.g. press a button operate a joy stick touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface speak into a microphone to provide a voice activated command etc. to not only pause restart and or indicate completion of the marking operation but further to select a landmark mode of operation for the marking device. As noted above in the discussion of any one or more of these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example as indicated in block of if a technician selects landmark mode via the user interface the user interface may provide a landmark mode signal to the processor. In response to this signal the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a landmark mode event entry including a landmark mode time stamp associated with the landmark mode signal. Additionally or alternatively the processor may respond to the landmark mode signal by taking one or more other actions pursuant to execution of a portion of the marking data algorithm including particular instructions to implement the landmark mode as discussed above the landmark mode may be entered in alternative implementations via a mode signal provided to the processor by a bypass device or an actuator locking device serving as a mode selector device .

Table 8 below provides an example of content and format for a mode select event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the marking device. The example mode select event entry shown below in Table 8 follows a similar format to that used for the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above.

In the process outlined in subsequent to selection of the landmark mode as noted in block the process may provide for the selection of a particular category and or type of landmark for which information is to be collected. To this end in one implementation the processor controls the user interface including display so as to display information to the technician to facilitate such a selection. In particular a landmark selection submenu may be displayed including one or more categories of landmarks displayed in any of a variety of manners e.g. as a list of text entries an arrangement of icons symbolizing respective categories labeled symbols etc. . Examples of landmark categories that may be displayed in such a submenu include but are not limited to 1 Natural Gas 2 Water Sewer 3 Power Line 4 Phone Line 5 CATV Line and 6 Other. 

Upon selection via the user interface of one of the landmark categories displayed on the submenu the processor may control the user interface so as to display yet another submenu indicating various types of landmarks that fall within the selected category so as to facilitate selection of a particular type of landmark for which information is to be collected. Examples of types of landmarks that may be displayed and available for selection via the user interface for each of the above identified categories include but are not limited to 

While the foregoing discussion of landmark categories and types provides one construct in which a wide variety of landmarks are made available for selection by the technician it should be appreciated that in other implementations options for landmark selection may be presented in different manners. For example a more succinct list of landmark types may be presented to the technician to facilitate easy selection e.g. a more limited set of about a dozen more common landmark types that might be encountered in the field such as telephone pole fire hydrant meter manhole curb etc. . More generally any number and variety of landmark types may be presented to the technician via the user interface in alphabetically ordered lists numerically ordered lists or other types of ordered text based or symbolic arrangements for example.

In another exemplary implementation the categories and or types of landmarks made available for selection via the user interface may be based at least in part on a type of facility being marked when the marking device was in a marking mode prior to selection of the landmark mode. For example consider a technician using the marking device in the marking mode and in the process of marking a power line. In one implementation upon switching to landmark mode the user is first presented with selection options for landmark category and or type that are more closely related to a power line e.g. a more limited subset of option types including pole transformer pedestal etc. . In one aspect the technician may nonetheless still have the option to select other categories and or types of landmarks but as a default the technician is first presented with options related to the type of facility last being marked. In another aspect the selection options for landmark category and or type may be specifically and intentionally limited to those options that are most germane to the type of facility last being marked in the previous marking mode i.e. immediately prior to entry into the landmark mode .

In yet another exemplary implementation the user interface may include a microphone and the processor may be configured to accept and process audible commands such that landmark category and or type selection may be accomplished via voice activated commands. For example once landmark mode is selected the technician may select a particular landmark category or type by simply speaking into the microphone e.g. telephone pole fire hydrant meter manhole curb etc. .

In addition to or as an alternative to selection of landmark category and or type block may provide for the entry of any of a variety of text information for inclusion as part of the landmark information in an electronic record. For example in some exemplary implementations via the user interface and or display the technician may enter text based information relating to an environmental landmark e.g. as an offset to another topological architectural or infrastructure feature in proximity to the environmental landmark telephone pole 5 ft. from back of curb . Additionally in a manner similar to landmark type selection the user interface display may provide for menu driven selection via a GUI of predetermined options for additional text based information to be included as part of the landmark information e.g. a set of stock text messages for selection to be included as part of landmark information .

Following selection of landmark category and or type in block of the process shown in and or entry section of any text based information in block of the process shown in in block actuations of the actuator in landmark mode cause the processor to collect various landmark information with each actuation which information is logged in an electronic record as a landmark event entry rather than an actuation event entry as noted in Table 3 above . Furthermore as noted above the processor and or the link transmitter of the actuation system may be particularly configured to either dispense or not dispense marking material upon actuations in landmark mode. Essentially in landmark mode the technician positions the marking device proximate to a selected category type of landmark and actuates the actuator to acquire various information relating to the landmark e.g. geo location data type time stamp .

In general the processor may be configured to communicate with e.g. poll any of a variety of input devices to collect landmark information to be logged in an electronic record. As discussed above in connection with the marking mode refer again to such information may be acquired from any of a variety of input devices including but not limited to the location tracking system the timing system the communications interface e.g. a USB port or other port the user interface and the local memory .

In particular any data that is available from the location tracking system e.g. any information available in various NMEA data messages such as coordinated universal time date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values dilution of precision values may be collected as landmark information and logged in an electronic record as part of a landmark event entry. Additionally information collected from the user interface in the form of a text entry by the technician may be included in a landmark event entry for example in one implementation upon actuation of the actuator the processor may prompt the technician via the display of the user interface to enter text notes if desired e.g. the technician may describe an offset of a target environmental landmark from an architectural topographical or infrastructure feature to compliment geographic information provided by the location tracking system and this textual information may serve as landmark information. In view of the foregoing it should be appreciated that landmark information may include a wide variety of information components including but not limited to one or more of geographical information e.g. from the location tracking system timing information e.g. from the location tracking system and or the timing system landmark category and or type information e.g. selected or entered via the user interface textual information e.g. entered via the user interface or other information e.g. received from the local memory and or the communications interface .

Table 9 below provides an example of content and format for a landmark event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the marking device when in landmark mode. The example landmark event entry shown below in Table 9 also follows a similar format to that used for the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above.

In the example landmark event entry given in Table 9 the landmark information includes a time stamp e.g. DATE and TIME geographical information e.g. GPS data category type information and text based information for an environmental landmark. The notation LMRK 3 12 in the example denotes a category 3 type 12 landmark which in the exemplary listings provided above corresponds to Power Line Circuit Breaker. It should be appreciated that the event entry shown in Table 9 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and that a variety of other or additional landmark information may be included in landmark event entries as noted above.

As with the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 above the exemplary format for a mode select and landmark event entry as shown in Tables 8 and 9 may be included in either an ASCII and XML file format for an electronic record that is stored and or transmitted by the marking device in which a particular naming scheme format may be adopted to identify files electronic records such as ServerID WandID Job ID . It should also be appreciated that an electronic record generated by a multi mode marking device in some instances may include a mixture of actuation event entries and landmark event entries actuation event entries without any landmark event entries and landmark event entries without any actuation event entries.

Yet another alternative format for storing and organizing landmark information in an electronic record according to one embodiment of the invention is shown in Tables 10 and 11 below. By way of example Table 10 shows the format and content of an electronic record entry for a utility pole which includes one geo location data point and Table 11 shows the format and content of an electronic record entry for a pedestal which includes four geo location data points i.e. one for each corner of the pedestal . It should be appreciated that the format and content shown below in Tables 10 and 11 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and as noted above a variety of format and content may be included in an electronic record entry for landmark information. The examples provided in Tables 10 and 11 may constitute an original electronic record generated by the processor pursuant to the process shown in or may be derived from raw data collected and logged pursuant to the process e.g. as a flat file an ASCII formatted file or an XML formatted file and subsequently reorganized and particularly formatted. It should also be appreciated that the examples provided in Tables 10 and 11 illustrate that landmark information may be included in an electronic record together with one or both of ticket information and service related information as discussed above in connection with electronic records including various marking information.

In other respects the data structure in is similar to that shown in . For example various other information that may be common to multiple or all actuation data sets of a given electronic record may be stored in one or more additional elements of the electronic record that are not contained within one or more of the actuation data sets themselves e.g. one or more of the ticket information field the service related information field and the marking material properties field which are shown as part of the data structure for a given actuation data set of the electronic record may instead be elements of the electronic record that are common to all actuation data sets of a given electronic record .

Once an actuation of the marking device in landmark mode has been logged as a landmark event entry the process shown in returns to block . At this point the technician is provided via the user interface display with the options of pausing the job block restarting the job if previously paused block stopping the job and indicating completion block or selecting landmark mode again block for the next actuation. If the technician selects none of these options the process returns to block at which point further polling and or interrupt events are logged i.e. an actuation event entry capturing marking information is logged with the next actuation of the actuator as discussed above in connection with . Accordingly after an actuation in landmark mode in one exemplary implementation the marking device defaults back to the marking mode unless and until the technician selects the landmark mode again for a subsequent actuation.

In an alternative implementation not shown in following actuation of the marking device in landmark mode the processor may control the user interface display to provide an option to the technician to exit landmark mode rather than automatically presenting the options of pause job restart job stop job or landmark mode . In this manner the marking device remains in landmark mode for subsequent actuations until the technician makes a menu selection to exit landmark mode at which point the process returns to block .

In yet another embodiment the processor executing marking data algorithm in landmark mode may be configured to generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets representing various event entries logged by the marking device e.g. as shown above in Tables 2 9 . As discussed above in connection with the marking mode each data packet may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. To accommodate both a marking mode and a landmark mode one flag field may be set or reset upon selection of the landmark mode so as to identify the contents of any information payload field in the data packet as landmark information as opposed to marking information. Similarly as discussed above one or more other flag fields may be set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. pull depress actuator release actuator marking dispenser in marking dispenser out low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of the actuator tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag and certain data packets also may be tagged as generated in marking mode or landmark mode. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the marking device in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

Thus in landmark identification mode a locate technician may employ an appropriately configured marking device to capture the types and locations of environmental landmarks of interest that are present at the work site and or in the general environs of a dig area. While in landmark mode the locate technician may approach a certain environmental landmark then select the type of the environmental landmark via user interface position the marking device e.g. place the tip of marking device proximate to the target environmental landmark and then actuate the marking device. In doing so the marking device logs in an electronic record landmark information including for example the type of the target environmental landmark the geo location of the target environmental landmark and a time stamp in an electronic record. The locate technician may move from one environmental landmark to the next until information about all environmental landmarks of interest has been captured. Additionally one or more data points e.g. landmark event entries may be captured for any given environmental landmark.

Other embodiments of the present invention relate to locate devices the collection of locate information associated with a locate operation and generation of an electronic record of such locate information. With reference again to as discussed above a locate device or so called locate set may include at least one transmitter and a locate receiver. In one embodiment of the present invention one or both of a locate transmitter and a locate receiver may be particularly configured according to various concepts discussed above in connection with marking devices and other concepts discussed in further detail below to acquire locate information relating to a locate operation generate an electronic record of the acquired locate information and store transmit analyze or otherwise process the acquired locate information.

Further description of features and functionality of a locate device that may be included in whole or in part in a locate device of the present invention can be found in the co pending U.S. patent application entitled Locate Apparatus having Enhanced Features for Underground Facility Locate Operations and Associated Methods and Systems filed on Feb. 11 2010 and assigned Ser. No. 12 704 087. This co pending application is incorporated herein by reference.

Various types of locate information may be generated during or otherwise associated with the use of a locate set to perform a locate operation. For example locate information related to the use of the transmitter may include but is not limited to information about the applied signal power the applied signal frequency the possible or available signal frequencies e.g. if the locate transmitter has more than one frequency available the presence magnitude and type of noise e.g. distortion on the applied signal e.g. a signal to noise ratio the location of the transmitter the mode of operation e.g. conductive or inductive and therefore the manner in which connection is made to the target object e.g. direct connection or inductive clamp an identification of the transmitter unit e.g. serial number make and model of the transmitter unit information about how the transmitter unit is grounded if at all and an indication of whether a sufficient electrical connection has been made to the target object e.g. some transmitters produce a continuity signal indicative of the quality of the connection between the transmitter and the target object . Locate information related to the use of the locate receiver may include but is not limited to an identification of the locate receiver e.g. a serial number the mode of operation of the locate receiver e.g. peak mode v. null mode as well as active v. passive mode the frequency to which the locate receiver is tuned the gain of the locate receiver the frequency of a detected magnetic field the amplitude strength of a detected magnetic field the electrical current of the detected signal the location of the locate receiver and a depth measurement taken by the locate receiver which may be used for example as additional information regarding a target object . In addition locate information relating to the locate operation itself may include but is not limited to information about the target object the location of the locate site the party requesting the locate the party performing the locate and whether any locate operations have previously been performed for this site.

Information about a tracer wire may also be included in locate information. For example information about the material of a tracer wire may be collected e.g. input verbally or textually by a technician which may indicate a type of underground facility e.g. aluminum may indicate cable tin steel may indicate phone and copper stainless steel may indicate gas among others . The wire gauge of the tracer wire as well as the condition of the tracer wire e.g. intact corroded etc. may also be visually determined by a locate technician and recorded verbally textually or in any other manner. Moreover whether the tracer wire is broken may be visually detected and noted as part of locate information. Similarly whether a service line is properly bonded to a main may be useful locate information. Furthermore information about the type of sheathing for the tracer wire may be included as part of locate information. Other types of information may also be considered locate information as these are non limiting examples.

According to some aspects of the invention locate information relating to a locate set and or locate operation more generally may be recorded transmitted and or processed for example to enable evaluation of the performance of the locate technician evaluation of the operation of the locate equipment reconstruction of the actions taken by the locate technician during the locate operation and or to facilitate comparison of collected data to historical data. In one exemplary embodiment a locate receiver is configured to store and or transmit locate information relating to a locate set and or a locate operation and in some implementations generate an electronic record of at least some of the locate information. Examples of locate related information that may be logged into an electronic record may include any of the types of information described above or any suitable combinations of information of interest and generally may include but are not limited to 

One or more electronic records based on the locate information described above or any other locate related information may be generated logged stored in local memory of the locate receiver formatted in any of a variety of manners as discussed above in connection with the marking device saved as any of a variety of file types having any of a variety of data structures processed and or analyzed at the locate receiver itself and or transmitted to another device for example to a computer or in those embodiments in which multiple locate receivers are used to complete a same locate operation to another locate receiver for storage processing and or analysis.

Some of the components illustrated in are similarly named to some components in relating to a marking device. According to some embodiments one or more of the components appearing in may be the same as or substantially similar to components in . For example in some embodiments one or more of the following components appearing in may be the same as or substantially similar to each other and therefore may function in the same or a substantially similar manner power source and power source remote computer and remote computer communication interface and communication interface user interface and user interface timing system and timing system location tracking system and location tracking system processor and processor local memory and local memory actuation system and actuation system . With respect to actuation system it should be appreciated that there is no marker dispensed by the locate receiver shown in but the actuation system may nonetheless initiate or control logging of data in a manner similar to that discussed above in connection with the marking device including taking of a depth measurement or performance of some other function of the locate receiver as described further below.

As shown in the locate receiver further includes detection electronics which provides another example of an input device that may provide location information to the processor . In exemplary implementations the detection electronics in turn includes an RF antenna a detection circuit and a processing circuit . Each of these components is explained in greater detail further below.

In some embodiments a user may commence a locate operation with the locate receiver by inputting various information to the locate receiver and or selecting various operating options via the user interface. As a non limiting example the user may select from various menu options using the user interface and display as a menu driven GUI and or manually enter via the user interface the type of target object facility to be located the address of the locate operation the ground type e.g. grass pavement etc. whether or not a separate transmitter is being used the mode of the locate receiver e.g. Peak v. Null whether the locate receiver is being operated in landmark mode or not described further below or any other information of interest to a locate operation.

In one exemplary implementation the user may first power on the locate receiver and log on for example by entering a user ID. The user may then navigate through a menu on a touch screen of the user interface to select the target object to be located for example selecting from among a list of options e.g. including facility types such as gas sewer cable and phone etc. . Similarly the user may then navigate through a menu to select the ground type in the area of the locate operation e.g. selecting from a list of options including grass pavement dirt etc. . The user may then similarly select or input the frequency of any applied signal provided by a transmitter for example using a keypad of the user interface or a menu driven GUI. It should be provided that these examples of user actions are non limiting and furthermore that in some embodiments one or more of the pieces of information listed may be detected automatically and not be input selected by the user.

Once the target object facility type and any other relevant or desired information is input and or selected by the technician and the applied signal from the transmitter is coupled to the target object the locate receiver may be used in a variety of manners by the technician for a locate operation in which the technician generally positions e.g. sweeps the locate receiver over an area in which they expect to detect an underground facility. More specifically the technician positions the locate receiver such that the RF antenna which may include more than one antenna as described further below may receive detect a magnetic field emitted by the target object see underground facility in .

In some embodiments the locate receiver is capable of operating in a null mode e.g. capable of detecting a null signal when positioned over an object e.g. facility emitting a magnetic field such that RF antenna may comprise a null detection antenna. Alternatively the locate receiver is capable of operating in a peak detection mode e.g. capable of detecting a peak signal when over an object e.g. facility emitting a magnetic field and the RF antenna comprises two peak detection antennae which may be positioned substantially parallel to each other but at different positions within the locate receiver e.g. at different heights . In some embodiments the locate receiver is capable of operating in both peak detection and null detection modes and the RF antenna may comprise three antennae e.g. one null detection antenna and two peak detection antennae. However RF antenna may comprise any other number type and orientation of antennae as the locate receivers described herein are not limited in these respects.

The RF antenna may be coupled to the detection circuit such that the signal s received detected by the RF antenna may be provided to the detection circuit as an output signal of the RF antenna. The output signal of the RF antenna may be any frequency detectable by the antenna and in some embodiments may be between approximately 512 Hz and 1 MHz although these non limiting frequencies are provided primarily for purposes of illustration. As mentioned the output signal of the RF antenna which in some embodiments is an analog signal may be provided to detection circuit which may perform various functions. For example the detection circuit may perform various front end operations on the output signal of RF antenna such as filtering buffering frequency shifting or modulation and or pre amplifying the output signal. Furthermore the detection circuit may perform additional functions such as amplifying and or digitizing the output signal provided by RF antenna . It should be appreciated however that the types of functions described as being performed by detection circuit are non limiting examples and that other functions may additionally or alternatively be performed.

After detection circuit has operated on the signal from RF antenna e.g. by filtering buffering amplifying and or digitizing among other possible operations it may provide a signal to processing circuit . The processing circuit may process the signal s provided by detection circuit in any suitable manner to determine any information of interest. For example according to one embodiment the processing circuit may process the signal s from detection circuit to determine a magnetic field strength of a magnetic field detected by RF antenna . The processing circuit may process the signal s from detection circuit to determine an amplitude and or direction of the electrical current creating the magnetic field s detected by RF antenna . Processing circuit may perform operations to calculate for example the depth and location of the target facility based on the electromagnetic fields detected by RF antenna . Processing circuit may be an analog circuit or a digital microprocessor or any other suitable processing component for performing one or more of the operations described above or any other operations of interest with respect to signals detected by RF antenna . Also it should be appreciated that processing circuit and processor described in further detail below may be a single processor in some embodiments as the illustration of them as distinct in is only one non limiting example.

Processor of control electronics may be any suitable processor for controlling and or coordinating operation of the detection electronics and or control electronics . For example the processor may be any general purpose processor controller or microcontroller device. In some embodiments processor controls logging of data e.g. locate information from the processing circuit timing system and or location tracking system to the local memory . The manner in which such data may be logged to the local memory may depend on the type of data being logged as the operation of locate receiver is not limited in this respect.

For example data from timing system and or location tracking system may be automatically logged continuously or periodically to the local memory may be logged in response to one or more types of events e.g. may be logged automatically when a particular event occurs and or may be logged at any suitable times. In particular in one implementation logging may occur at periodic intervals during performance of a locate operation such as every second every five seconds every minute or at any other suitable time interval. According to another embodiment timing information and or geographic information from timing system and location tracking system respectively may be logged in response to particular types of events such as detecting an underground facility or detecting the absence of an underground facility. Such events may be identified by signals output by processing circuit to processor . As a non limiting example timing information and or geographic information may be logged when a characteristic e.g. magnetic field strength of a signal detected by RF antenna is greater than a particular threshold value which may be indicated by a signal output from processing circuit to processor and which occurrence may be indicative of the presence of an underground facility. Similarly in some embodiments time timing information and or geographic information may be logged when a signal detected by RF antenna has a magnitude above a first threshold and the gain of the locate receiver is above a second threshold. It should be appreciated that various combinations of detected signals detected by locate receiver may be used to trigger logging of information e.g. timing information and or geographic information to local memory. It should also be appreciated that any information available from the location tracking system e.g. any information available in various NMEA data messages such as coordinated universal time date latitude north south indicator longitude east west indicator number and identification of satellites used in the position solution number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation azimuth and SNR values dilution of precision values may be included in geographic information constituting all or a portion of logged locate information.

In some embodiments alternatively or in addition to automatic logging of locate information based on some condition or event a user of the locate receiver may manually trigger logging of timing information geographic information and or any other data associated with a locate operation or locate receiver locate information for example by manipulating a control e.g. button knob joystick of the user interface or by actuating an actuator e.g. a trigger pull mechanism similar to the actuator of the marking device shown in integrated or otherwise associated with the locate receiver as shown in which may be part of the actuation system and which may cause a signal to be sent to the processor to initiate logging of locate information. For example according to some embodiments a user may initiate the locate receiver taking a depth measurement by depressing a pushbutton of the user interface or pulling squeezing the actuator which may also trigger the logging of timing information and or geographic information from timing system and location tracking system . The depth measurement data time data and or location data may then be logged in an electronic record in local memory .

It should be appreciated that while the foregoing discussion focuses on logging locate information to local memory the locate information may also or alternatively be transmitted to remote computer via communication interface . As with logging locate information to local memory the transmission of locate information to remote computer may be performed continuously periodically in response to one or more types of events in response to user input or actuation of an actuator or in any other suitable manner.

As discussed above in connection with the marking device in yet another embodiment the processor of the locate receiver may be configured to continuously collect various available locate information e.g. repeatedly regularly poll all available input devices and other components of the locate receiver and generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets including locate information. In one aspect of this embodiment each data packet of locate information may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. For example in one implementation the header for each packet may include one or more of a job ID e.g. ticket identifier technician ID device ID e.g. serial number packet type ID and or a time stamp corresponding to logging of information generation of the packet. Each packet also may include one or more payload fields for carrying information provided by the polled device s or components of the locate receiver and one or more flag fields that are set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. signal strength from receiver antenna exceeding a predetermined threshold low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of an actuator or other event based logging of locate information tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the locate device in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

As with those embodiments relating to a marking device previously described in section II of this application various locate event entries including locate information corresponding to different events relating to use and operation of one or more locate devices may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the locate device s described herein. A process for collecting and logging locate information during operation of a locate receiver may be a process similar to that described above in connection with a marking operation and shown in . Various exemplary formats for these locate event entries are now described although it should be appreciated that various other entries and formats are possible as those shown and described below are provided primarily for purposes of illustration.

While the collection and logging of locate information to generate an electronic record is discussed in some aspects for purposes of illustration in terms of actuation data sets i.e. a set of data that is associated and logged with a corresponding actuation of the locate receiver it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect. More generally an electronic record of a locate operation may be generated in any of a variety of manners have a variety of file formats and or data structures and include any of a variety of locate information.

Table 12 below illustrates an example of a portion of the contents of a relatively simple flat file for an electronic record that may be generated during a locate operation using a process like that illustrated in 

The portion of the file shown in Table 12 corresponds to multiple locate signal event entries indicating detection of a facility one entry per line . Each entry has a time stamp e.g. entries are logged at a rate of approximately five events per second and further includes multiple fields having respective values e.g. as comma separated values for latitude and longitude coordinates received from the location tracking device an event indicator indicating that the locate receiver is detecting Detection and a color code indicating the type of facility detected e.g. as established by the American Public Works Association and shown in Table 7 .

As noted above it should be appreciated that the portion of the file shown in Table 12 is provided primarily for purposes of illustration and that the format and or content for respective event entries and the file itself for an electronic record generated by and or based on the information collection process may have any of a variety of different formats and or content.

To this point Tables 13 through 16 below provide examples of various events for which event entries may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the locate receiver exemplary formats for these event entries and exemplary file formats for files having multiple such entries according to another embodiment of the present invention.

Job Started Paused Restarted Completed Events As with the marking devices described above one event entry format for a locate receiver according to an embodiment of the present invention provides information about when a locate operation job was started and completed in addition to capturing details about if and when the job was paused and restarted. Such an entry may substantially take the form of the analogous entry in Table 2 understanding that the WAND ID portion of the entry may be replaced by a LOCATE RECEIVER ID portion.

Actuation Events As has been described according to at least one embodiment of the present invention a locate receiver may be operated to collect and or transmit locate information upon actuation by a user. Table 13 illustrates an example of an entry relating to the actuation event. Locate information from one or more input devices other components of the locate device may be recorded upon actuation to provide information about the job in progress. The facility type information may be entered selected by a user as described previously and may be recorded in the event for example according to the color coding scheme of Table 7.

Locate Device Status Events The status event of a locate device collects various locate related information and or information on operating characteristics of the locate device on a periodic basis while a job is in progress e.g. pursuant to processor polls . The entry may be similar to that illustrated in Table 4 for marking devices although the information may relate to the locate aspect of a job. An example is shown below in Table 14. In the non limiting example the entries include information about the mode of the locate receiver e.g. peak v. null . It should be appreciated however that other information may additionally or alternatively be included in the event entry.

Error Events As with the discussion of Table 5 in the context of a marking device one or more types of error events may be logged in association with a locate device. The errors may correspond to a malfunction of a locate receiver and or any input device or any other errors of interest. In some cases the user technician also may be notified of the error through the user interface or display visible alert on display audible alarm alert etc. . Similar event formats may be adopted for warning alerts events and informational alerts events. An error event entry may take substantially the same form as that shown in Table 15.

It should be appreciated that the event types described above and the logged location information shown in the corresponding tables are provided primarily for purposes of illustration and are not limiting. Thus events of various other types and with various other information may be logged into an electronic record.

Table 16 shown below lists another example of the contents of an electronic record of locate information that may be generated and stored and or transmitted relating to operation of a locate receiver according to one non limiting embodiment. The electronic record shown in Table 16 includes a record number record 1001 an identification of the service provider an identification of the user i.e. the locate technician operating the locate receiver and an identification of the locate receiver. The mode of operation of the locate receiver e.g. peak may also be included. Timing information timestamp data from a timing system of the locate receiver and geographic information from a location tracking system of the locate receiver may also be included. The signal strength and signal frequency entries of the electronic record indicate characteristics of a signal e.g. a magnetic field detected by the locate receiver for example emitted from an underground facility. The signal strength is listed in the example of Table 16 as a percentage of the maximum detectable by the locate receiver although it should be appreciated that other units of measurement may alternatively be used. The gain entry indicates the gain setting of the locate receiver. The electronic record also includes an entry for the depth of the facility targeted as may be determined by taking a depth measurement using a locate receiver e.g. by calculating a difference in magnetic field strength detected by two different antennae at two different locations within a locate receiver and for the facility type e.g. gas electric etc. and ground type in the area of the locate operation. The electronic record of Table 16 also includes the address of the locate operation and the party requesting the locate operation. Lastly Table 16 includes information about the remaining battery life of the locate receiver for those embodiments that include a battery.

It should be appreciated that Table 16 represents only one non limiting example of an electronic record of locate information which may be generated in accordance with the operation of a locate receiver according to one embodiment. In particular a single electronic record of locate information collected in connection with operation of a locate receiver may include multiple entries of a given data type. For example while Table 16 illustrates an electronic record including a single GPS data point it should be appreciated that multiple GPS data points may be taken and stored within a single electronic record. The multiple GPS data points may be taken in response to a single actuation event e.g. single actuator pull by a technician in response to multiple actuation events e.g. multiple actuator pulls by a technician or in other manners. Thus multiple pieces of data may be collected for an electronic record of a locate operation and it should be appreciated that any single electronic record may include multiple entries for example as shown above with respect to Table 16.

As discussed above in connection with the marking device shown in a file for an electronic record of locate information may have any of a variety of formats and include any of a variety of data structures. For example such a file may be a flat file including a succession of time stamped locate event entries of various locate information for example as shown in Tables 12 16 logged automatically as a result of one or more particular conditions e.g. exceeded thresholds for various signals or manually as a result of user actuation of the locate receiver or a differently formatted file e.g. an ASCII file a CSV file an XML file including files having a data structure that segregates or separates in some manner the locate information into multiple different fields. Examples of ASCII and XML file formats are described above in connection with the collecting and logging of information by a marking device.

As shown the locate receiver may comprise a housing to which at least some of the components of the locate receiver are mechanically coupled e.g. affixed housed within etc. . As shown the RF antenna of detection electronics may be mechanically coupled to the housing e.g. supported inside the housing and in this non limiting example includes three antennae . Antennae and may be configured to operate as peak detection antenna while antenna may be configured to operate as a null detection antenna. In some embodiments the antennae and may be oriented substantially parallel to each other and in some embodiments are oriented at approximately 90 degrees relative to antenna . Again it should be appreciated that the number type and orientation of the antennae of locate receiver are not limited to that shown in . In addition the control electronics may be disposed within the housing and may be coupled to the detection electronics by one or more wired or wireless connections.

As illustrated in some of the components of the locate receiver may be positioned externally on the housing . For example the location tracking system e.g. in the form of a GPS receiver may be mounted on an electrical ground plane mechanically coupled to the housing . The user interface may be located externally on the housing and as mentioned previously may include one or more buttons switches knobs a touch screen or other user selection items. A display may also be included on an outer surface of the housing to display information to a user.

In the non limiting example of the housing includes a handle by which a user may hold the locate receiver . In some embodiments the power source may be located within the handle although other configurations are also possible.

As with the marking devices described above some aspects of the invention provide a locate device e.g. locate receiver that may be configured e.g. via particular instructions executing on the processor to operate in multiple different modes to collect various information relating not only to a locate operation locate information but additionally or alternatively various information relating to the work site dig areas in which the locate operation is performed. For example in one implementation the locate receiver may be configured to operate in a first locate mode which essentially follows various aspects of the operation of the locate receiver described herein and also may be configured to operate in a second landmark identification mode like that described previously in connection with a marking device. When switched into the landmark mode the locate receiver may stop detecting a magnetic field e.g. the RF antenna of the locate receiver may be temporarily disabled in some embodiments. In other embodiments the locate receiver may continue to operate and the landmark mode may represent additional functionality added to the locate receiver functionality.

According to those aspects of the invention providing a locate device e.g. locate receiver configurable to operate in both a locate mode and a landmark mode the landmark mode may be substantially the same as the landmark mode previously described herein. For example the landmark mode of a locate receiver may be used to collect the same types of landmark information described previously with respect to marking devices having a landmark mode such as any of the types of information illustrated and described with respect to Tables 8 11 or any other suitable information.

The locate receiver may have any suitable components circuitry allowing for operation in both a landmark mode and a locate receiver mode. For example the locate receiver may include a bypass device similar to that described with respect to a marking device including landmark functionality in which the bypass device may bypass the operation of the locate receiver functioning to detect a target object. Alternatively a user may select the landmark mode of the locate receiver from a user interface analogous to that previously described in the context of a marking device having landmark functionality.

Thus it should be appreciated that the landmark functionality previously described with respect to a marking device may be suitably applied in the context of a locate receiver according to some embodiments.

Some embodiments of the present invention relate to a data acquisition system comprising a locate device communicatively coupled to a marking device. The locate device may be substantially the same as those described herein relating to various embodiments of the present invention and the marking device may be substantially the same as those described herein relating to various embodiments of the present invention. The locate device and marking device may communicate with each other to exchange information relating to their respective uses during a locate and marking operation. In one embodiment at least one of the locate device and marking device may be further communicatively coupled to an external device e.g. a computing device to receive data from and or transmit data to the external device.

In certain embodiments communication between a locate and marking device may be through an intermediary e.g. a remote computer or a portable electronic device rather than directly between a locate device and a marking device. A remote computer or portable electronic device may serve as a hub for one or more locate devices and or one or more marking devices. The remote computer or portable electronic device may be in communication with a local area network or wide area network e.g. the worldwide web.

Communication between the locate receiver and the marking device may proceed under any suitable protocol such as via any of the communication interfaces and protocols described above in connection with a marking device and may include any suitable information as the embodiments described herein relating to a locate device communicatively coupled to a marking device are not limited in this respect. According to one embodiment one of the locate device and marking device may receive one or more event entries or one or more electronic records generated by the other device. The receiving device may then combine the received event entries electronic records with event entries electronic records it has generated and store and or transmit the combined data. Event entries and or electronic records from different devices may be combined based on a common key e.g. a common timestamp a common job ID any combination of information such as date time and location or any other suitable key or in any other manner.

As a non limiting example the locate receiver may generate a locate event entry of the format illustrated in Table 14. The locate event entry may be transmitted to the marking device which itself may have generated a marking actuation event entry of the type illustrated in Table 3. The marking device may combine the locate event entry from the locate receiver with the marking actuation event entry it has generated if for example the two records share some common key i.e. means of identifying relating and or associating the respective event entries records from different devices. Examples of common keys may include but are not limited to a common job ID device ID s that are recognized as a working pair of partnered locate receivers and marking devices discussed further below common file names or file extensions for electronic records a common timestamp an exact match may not be required in all embodiments but rather time within some suitable tolerance may suffice a common geographic location e.g. one or more GPS coordinates for a present location of the respective devices and information derived from any other entry or combination of entries from the respective devices. The combined or compiled electronic record may then be stored in local memory of marking device and or transmitted to remote computer .

It should be appreciated that the above described example is not limiting and is provided primarily for purposes of illustration. For example the respective roles of the locate receiver and marking device may be reversed in some embodiments. Alternatively both devices may receive data from the other of the two devices and may store and or transmit the data.

In one embodiment a locate receiver may be partnered with a particular marking device such that the locate receiver and marking device are recognized as communicatively paired for purposes of exchanging and or sharing information. In one aspect partnered devices may be identified by linking associating their respective device IDs e.g. manufacturer serial numbers assigned IDs etc. in the local memory of one or both devices and or in an external database accessible to both devices e.g. stored in the remote computer . The linking of two such devices may be based on a number of factors conditions examples of which include but are not limited to a locate receiver and a marking device being assigned checked out to the same technician and or commonly docked together assigned to the same vehicle .

In another embodiment a locate receiver and or a marking device may not necessarily be configured to communicate with a particular partner e.g. designated a priori but rather one or both of the devices may be configured to communicate with any other locate or marking device within a given area e.g. within 10 meters as one non limiting example . To this end in one exemplary implementation a locate receiver and or marking device may poll for devices within some area when turned on e.g. may broadcast messages to look for partners based on some criterion criteria and or look for wireless communication signals such as Bluetooth signals of sufficient strength . Other scenarios are also possible as the embodiments described herein relating to locate receivers communicatively coupled to marking devices are not limited to the manner in which the devices communicate or identify one another for communication.

The data may be transmitted between the locate receiver and marking device at any suitable times such as periodically upon user actuation or in other suitable manner. Also it should be appreciated that the locate receiver and marking device need not be used together in all embodiments. For example the two devices may be used on different days or at any other time relative to each other and may exchange information at any suitable time. Thus the various aspects described herein relating to a locate receiver communicatively coupled to a marking device are not limited in these respects.

Yet other embodiments of the present invention are directed to a combined locate and marking device also referred to herein as a combination locate and marking device or combined locate and marking apparatus . The combined locate and marking device may function as both a locate receiver for locating objects e.g. underground facilities and a marking device as discussed herein in the preceding sections.

According to one aspect of such embodiments a combination locate and marking device is provided which is configured to collect store transmit to an external device and or analyze process any of the data types described previously herein locate information marking information and or landmark information any combination of such data types or any other information of relevance to the operation of the combined locate and marking device.

The operation of the components of combination locate and marking device may be coordinated in various manners. As has been described previously herein the detection electronics may operate to detect the presence or absence of a target object such as an underground facility. The marking related components e.g. actuation system marking dispenser etc. may be used in connection with dispensing a marking material for example to mark the location of an underground facility once detected. In practice the two activities detecting a target object and marking a location of the target object may not coincide temporally. Rather a locate technician may scan an area one or more times to detect the presence of the target object or may have to scan over a large area to determine the extent of the target object utilizing the locate receiver functionality of the combination locate and marking device. In some embodiments the locate technician may operate the combination locate and marking device to dispense a marking material after the target object is detected or in some instances intermittently while detecting the target object e.g. while following the length of an underground facility . Thus various schemes may be employed to coordinate the object detection functionality and the marking functionality.

According to some embodiments the object detection functionality and the marking functionality may operate at separate times. For example in one such embodiment the combination locate and marking device may separately operate in a detection mode and a marking mode and a user e.g. locate technician may select which mode to use for example by selecting the mode from the user interface. In such an embodiment the user may operate the combination locate and marking device as a locate receiver until the target object is detected and then may switch modes to a marking mode in which the user may operate the combination locate and marking device to dispense marking material. In another such embodiment the combination locate and marking device may operate substantially continuously as a locate receiver until the user actuates the actuation system at which time the locate receiver functionality may automatically be suspended and the combination locate and marking device may shift to a marking mode for dispensing marking material. Other manners of coordinating the functionality of a combination locate and marking device are also possible as those manners explicitly listed herein are provided primarily for purposes of illustration.

In addition as described further below a combination locate and marking device is further configurable to operate in a landmark mode according to one embodiment of the present invention. In some such embodiments the landmark mode may be a distinct mode which may selected by the user much like the above described selection of the object detection functionality and the marking functionality. However other manners in which the combination device may be placed into a landmark mode of operation are also possible.

It should be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that locate information generated in connection with the object detection functionality of a combination locate and marking device may not coincide temporally with the generation of marking information associated with the marking functionality of the combination locate and marking device. The logging and or transmission of locate and or marking information generated by a combination locate and marking device may be coordinated in various manners and the aspects of the invention relating to combination locate and marking devices are not limited to any particular manner of logging and or transmitting such information. Table 17 illustrates some exemplary schemes for coordinating logging and or transmission of information relating to both the locate and marking functionality of a combination locate and marking device. It should be appreciated that the examples of Table 17 are not exhaustive and that other schemes are also possible.

According to one embodiment locate information generated in connection with the locate receiver functionality of combination locate and marking device may be logged and or transmitted continuously. For example object detection related information such as the detected magnetic field strength expressed for example as a percentage of the maximum detectable magnetic field strength the magnitude of the electrical current creating the detected magnetic field and the location of the combination locate and marking device may be logged continuously to local memory for example in one or more electronic records in the local memory . According to one such embodiment information relating to any marking performed with the combination locate and marking device e.g. marking material information position of the combination locate and marking device duration of actuation etc. may be logged upon actuation of the actuation system .

According to another embodiment locate information generated in connection with the locate receiver functionality of combination locate and marking device may be logged and or transmitted periodically e.g. at least every two seconds every five seconds or at any other suitable intervals . For example the locate information may be logged in local memory and or transmitted to remote computer via communication interface every five seconds every ten seconds every thirty seconds every minute every five minutes or at any other time interval. According to one such embodiment marking information relating to any marking performed with the combination locate and marking device e.g. marking material information position of the combination locate and marking device duration of actuation etc. may be logged upon actuation of the actuation system .

According to another embodiment locate information generated in connection with the locate receiver functionality of combination locate and marking device may be logged in response to an event. The event may be the detection of an underground facility for example as indicated by detection of a magnetic field magnitude above a threshold value may be the detection of the absence of an underground facility may be the taking of a depth measurement or may be any other event of interest. As but one example information relating to magnetic field strength detected electrical current magnitude geographical location of the combination locate and marking device and timing information may be automatically logged into an electronic record in local memory upon detection by RF antenna of a magnetic field magnitude exceeding a threshold value. Other events however may additionally or alternatively be used to trigger logging of locate information related to the locate receiver functionality.

In some such embodiments in which locate information relating to the locate receiver functionality is logged and or transmitted in response to detection of an event of interest marking material may be automatically dispensed in response to detection of the event and marking information about the marking functionality may be automatically logged into the local memory for example in combination with the electronic record s relating to the locate receiver functionality or in one or more separate electronic records. In others of such embodiments in which locate information relating to the locate functionality is logged and or transmitted in response to detection of an event of interest marking material may be dispensed only upon actuation by a user e.g. a locate technician and marking information relating to the marking functionality may be logged in local memory and or transmitted to remote computer via communication interface upon actuation of the actuation system . In some embodiments the actuation system may be disabled until the one or more types of events e.g. detection of a magnetic field of suitable magnitude detection of the presence of an applied signal from a transmitter etc. occurs at which time the actuation system may be enabled and a user may choose whether or not to actuate the system.

In yet other embodiments locate information relating to the locate receiver functionality of the combination locate and marking device and marking information relating to the marking functionality are both logged in local memory and or transmitted e.g. to a remote computer upon actuation of the actuation system . In some embodiments both types of information are logged and or transmitted for a same actuation of the actuation system . In other embodiments separate actuations are used to log and or transmit locate information relating to the locate receiver functionality and marking information relating to the marking functionality which in some embodiments may depend at least partially on whether the combination device is in a locate mode or a marking mode of operation.

While various schemes have been described by which information relating to both the locate receiver functionality and the marking functionality of combination locate and marking device may be logged and or transmitted it should be appreciated that other schemes are also possible. The various aspects described herein relating to a combination locate and marking device are not limited to any particular manner of coordinating logging and or transmission of information relating to the operation of the device.

According to those embodiments of the invention relating to a combination locate and marking device various events may be logged for one or more of the locate marking and landmark functionality described further below . For example events according to Tables 2 5 for the marking functionality may be logged. Events according to Tables 12 13 for the locate functionality may be generated. Other event types are also possible as it should be appreciated that those explicitly described herein are primarily for purposes of illustration and are not limiting of the types of events that may be logged. For example an event may be logged corresponding to a mode selection between a locate mode a marking mode and a landmark mode of a combination locate and marking device in those embodiments in which such a device may be operated in the three described modes. Table 18 below provides an example of content and format for a mode select event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and or transmitted by the combination locate and marking device. The example mode select event entry shown below in Table 18 follows a similar format to that used for the event entry examples provided in Tables 2 5 and 8 above. It should be appreciated that other types of events may also or alternatively be logged and that the examples described herein are provided primarily for purposes of illustration.

As discussed above in connection with both marking devices and locate devices in yet another embodiment the processor of a combination locate and marking device may be configured to generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets representing various event entries logged by the device. In particular each data packet may include a header one or more flag fields and one or more information payload fields. To accommodate one or more of a locate mode a marking mode and a landmark mode one or more flag fields may be set or reset upon selection of the respective modes so as to identify the contents of any information payload field in the data packet as one of locate information marking information and landmark information. Similarly as discussed above one or more other flag fields may be set or reset upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events e.g. pull depress actuator release actuator marking dispenser in marking dispenser out logging of locate receiver based on signal strength or other event low power communication link fail etc. . In this manner a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor in which certain interrupt events such as an actuation and or release of the actuator tag certain data packets via an interrupt flag and certain data packets also may be tagged as generated in a particular operating mode. In yet other aspects of this embodiment all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and or transmitted from the device in essentially real time alternatively only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and or transmitted.

Table 19 below illustrates one non limiting example of four electronic records that may be stored in the local memory of the combination locate and marking device each corresponding for example to a separate actuation event of actuation system . It should be appreciated however that these are merely examples and that various alternative electronic records may be generated according to the aspects of the invention for example reflecting different types of information associated with operation of a combination locate and marking device.

Each of the four records of Table 19 includes general information not limited to either the locate receiver functionality or marking functionality of the combination device such as an identification of the service provider Service provided ID an identification of the user User ID an identification of the device Device ID and information about the requestor of the locate operation and the requested address Locate request data . In addition an entry describing the mode of data collection e.g. Manual for the device is also collected which may indicate that information is logged into the record s upon actuation of the actuation system . Information about the actuation itself such as the time of actuation Timestamp data actuation duration and geographical location at the start during and or at and end of the actuation may also be included. The electronic records also include information relating to the locate receiver functionality of the combination locate and marking device including the receiver detection mode i.e. PEAK in Table 19 the strength of a detected signal the gain of the receiver and the frequency of the detected signal. Information relating to a depth measurement Facility depth is also included as is information about the marking material to be dispensed by the combination locate and marking device. Information about the remaining battery life of the device may also be included in those embodiments in which the combination device includes a battery. Again it should be appreciated that Table 19 is an illustration of one electronic record that may be generated in association with operation of a combination locate and marking device and that other forms of electronic records are also possible.

As discussed above in connection with the marking device shown in and the locate device shown in a file for an electronic record of combined locate information and marking information may have any of a variety of formats and include any of a variety of data structures. For example such a file may be a flat file including a succession of time stamped event entries of various locate information logged automatically as a result of one or more particular conditions e.g. exceeded thresholds for various signals or manually as a result of user actuation of the combined device marking information e.g. logged as a result of user actuation of the combined device and or landmark information or a differently formatted file e.g. an ASCII file a CSV file an XML file etc. as well as files having a data structure that segregates or separates in some manner the locate marking and or landmark information into multiple different fields.

Information generated in association with the locate functionality of a combination locate and marking device may be logged and or transmitted with information associated with the marking functionality of the device in any suitable manner. In one embodiment information generated in association with the locate functionality may be logged and or transmitted in separate electronic records from information generated in association with the marking functionality. The separate records may be independent in some embodiments with no coordination between them. In an alternative embodiment electronic records generated in association with the locate functionality may be coordinated with electronic records generated in association with the marking functionality for example by appending one record to another or by providing linking information such as a pointer identifying the separate records as being relevant to each other. In one non limiting embodiment a combination locate and marking device may be operated in a manner such that it is expected that locate information will be collected preceding the collection of marking information for example one after the other and separate electronic files for the locate and marking operation may be grouped by grouping a locate related file with a subsequent marking related file.

In yet other embodiments such as that described with respect to Table 19 above information associated with the locate functionality may be logged and or transmitted in a single file including information associated with the marking functionality. The information may be identified as belonging in a single record in one non limiting embodiment using any common key such as a common timestamp a common geographic location e.g. GPS coordinates a common job ID any combination of information or any other common key. Thus even in those embodiments in which locate information and marking information are not generated at substantially the same time e.g. when a mode change is used to switch from locate functionality to marking functionality the information may be coordinated and compiled using a common key.

The information logged and or transmitted by combination locate and marking device may be used for various applications. For example the information may be used to monitor progress and or operation of the user to monitor operation of the device itself to reconstruct the user s actions at a later time and date and or to compare to historical information. Various examples of computer assisted visual rendering of locate information and or marking information are discussed below in section VI.

The detection electronics are illustrated as being positioned toward the tip of the combination locate and marking device . It should however be appreciated that the detection electronics which as shown in comprises multiple components may be arranged in a more distributed fashion relative to the elongated housing . For example the RF antenna which again may include any number of antennae may be positioned toward the tip of combination locate and marking device while the detection circuit and processing circuit may be positioned at other locations for example near control electronics or at any other suitable location. It should also be appreciated that electrical connection between two or more of the electrical components illustrated in may be made in any suitable manner for example by wired interconnections as appropriate.

According to one embodiment one or more components of the detection electronics such as the RF antenna may be electrically shielded from other components of the combination locate and marking device for example to prevent the other components from interfering with the detection of magnetic field by the RF antenna. As an example a shield plate e.g. made of metal or any other suitable shielding material may be positioned suitably to shield one or more components of the detection electronics for example by positioning the shield plate between the detection electronics and the actuation mechanism in . Other configurations are also possible and not all embodiments of a combination locate and marking device are limited to having a shield plate for electrically shielding the detection electronics .

The display of the combination locate and marking device may be used to display various information of interest to a user. For example information about a detected magnetic field strength a detected signal frequency a mode of operation or a depth measurement may be displayed. Similarly information about marking material e.g. color brand amount remaining in a marking material dispenser etc. may also be displayed to the user. In some embodiments the display may be a touch screen display although other display types are also possible as discussed above in connection with previously described embodiments.

Referring to method of in act the electromagnetic field of the target facility to be located is detected by the combination locate and marking device . More specifically the detection electronics of the combination locate and marking device may detect for example an electromagnetic field emitted by a facility. The detection circuit may receive amplify and filter signals from RF antenna . Further the signals may be digitized in detection circuit and passed to processing circuit which may perform operations to calculate depth and location of the target facility based on the electromagnetic fields that are detected by RF antenna . The output that is generated by processing circuit may then be displayed to the user via user interface and or stored in local memory .

In act an actuation event of an actuator of the combination locate and marking device is sensed. In act any information of interest associated with the combination locate and marking event is captured in response to sensing the actuation event. For example any of the information shown in Table 19 may be captured or any other information of interest associated with the combination locate and marking device.

In act information associated with the combined locate and marking event including the information captured at block may be stored and or transmitted in real time or non real time to a remote computer and or network.

Referring to the method begins at block in which an applied signal is provided on the target facility to be located. For example referring to locate transmitter may be coupled to a target facility and send an applied signal along the target facility. In other embodiments the applied signal may be an alternating current AC signal already present on the target facility e.g. if the target facility is a power line or may be a signal from locate transmitter that is conductively or inductively coupled to a tracer wire along the length of a passive facility such as a sewer or gas line.

In act the user loads the marking dispenser into the combination locate and marking device. For example the user of combination locate and marking device loads marking dispenser into marking material holder as shown in .

In act the user activates i.e. powers on the combination locate and marking device by the actuation of for example a manual pushbutton or toggle switch of user interface or in any other suitable manner. As a result power from power source is delivered to the active components of combination locate and marking device.

In act the user performs a scan with the combination locate and marking device to detect the presence and or absence of a target facility. For example the user may sweep the combination locate and marking device over the ground. The signal strength of any detected electromagnetic field may be presented to the user via the user interface. The user interface may include for example a visual display of the signal strength e.g. display numerical readings of signal strength display a variable length bar that corresponds to signal strength etc. and or an audible tone that varies in pitch and or amplitude with signal strength.

In act it is determined whether the target facility is located for example based upon the strength of any electromagnetic field detected in act . If the target facility is located method proceeds to act at which the user dispenses marking material for example by actuating an actuator of the combination locate and marking device. Conversely if the target facility is not located method returns to act .

In act information associated with the locate operation may be stored locally and or transmitted to an external system or device. For example data such as the data shown in Table 9 may be stored in local memory and or transmitted in real time or non real time to a remote computer and or network via a communication link of the combination locate and marking device.

In act a determination is made whether the locate and marking operation is complete for example based on instructions provided with the locate request. If the locate operation is complete method ends. If the locate operation is not complete method returns to act .

According to one embodiment of the present invention a combination locate and marking device may be configurable to operate in a landmark mode substantially the same as the landmark mode described previously herein in connection with marking devices and with locate receivers. The combination locate and marking device may include any components and circuitry suitable to allow for operation in a landmark mode such as the bypass components actuation locking components and or user interface components previously described with respect to a marking device providing landmark functionality or any other suitable components and circuitry. Similarly the types of information collected and the manner of operation of a combination locate and marking device exhibiting landmark functionality may be substantially the same as that previously described with respect to marking devices having landmark functionality.

With reference to the marking device illustrated in the locate device illustrated in the data acquisition system of or the combined locate and marking device illustrated in in yet another embodiment the processor associated with any of these devices and or one or more remote computers may additionally process various locate information marking information and or landmark information provided in real time from one or more of these devices and or stored in one or more electronic records and control a display device e.g. display of marking device or combined locate and marking device or display of locate receiver or some other display device such as a display on a remote computer to render a computer generated visual representation of locate information marking information and or landmark information. Such a visual representation may be used for example to provide immediate feedback to the locate technician provide essentially real time feedback to a supervisor monitoring the technician from a remote location provide a visual record of the locate information marking information and or landmark information e.g. for archiving purposes once one or more electronic records are generated and or to verify the quality e.g. accuracy and completeness of work performed during the locate and or marking operation. It should be appreciated that in various exemplary implementations of a computer generated visual representation according to the present invention any one or combination of locate information marking information and landmark information may be visually rendered in a display field.

In various aspects of this embodiment a visual representation may be static in that all available information is presented in a display field at one time after collection of the information e.g. completion of the locate and or marking operation and generation of an electronic record alternatively the visual representation may be dynamic in that information representing successive actuations of a locate device a marking device or a combined locate and marking device or automatic logging of data in a locate device is displayed in essentially real time as it is collected or may be displayed after collection e.g. generation of an electronic record in a time sequenced animation that recreates the collection of information e.g. recreates the locate and or marking operation on the time scale in which it was originally acquired.

In other aspects the relative positions of GPS identified events objects noted in an electronic record including one or more of locate information marking information and landmark information may be displayed e.g. based on geo location data and some appropriate scale of an available display field of display to provide a visual representation. A visual representation may also be rendered in one or more particular colors corresponding to one or more particular underground facilities located and or marked e.g. see Table 7 .

In one exemplary implementation relating to marking operations such a visual representation may include one electronic locate mark displayed in a display field for each actuation dispensing action of a marking device or combined locate and marking device such that there is essentially a one to one correspondence between electronic locate marks and physical locate marks for a given underground facility marked during a marking operation. Alternatively in another exemplary implementation of such a visual representation for a marking operation an essentially continuous solid line or other line type may be displayed in a display field to represent a given underground facility marked during a marking operation.

In another aspect of data processing for computer aided visual rendering the processor may process the geo location data in electronic records from a locate device a marking device and or a combined locate and marking device so as to filter average interpolate and or otherwise smooth data e.g. so as to provide cleaner visual renderings and or connect successive locate marks represented by respective actuation data sets of an electronic record alternatively raw data provided by a given device may be utilized for the visual representation. In yet another aspect of this embodiment visual representations of multiple locate and or marking operations for different underground facilities within the same work site dig area may be generated in the same display field of a display device so as to provide a composite visual representation in which different underground facilities may be uniquely identified in some manner e.g. by different line types and or different colors and one or more environmental landmarks in and or around the work site dig area may be identified using a variety of displayed identifiers e.g. icons symbols marks shapes etc. .

In the following discussion a process for generating a visual representation in a display field based on information in an electronic record is described for illustrative purposes based on marking information and or landmark information contained in an electronic record as acquired using a marking device or a combined locate and marking device . However it should be appreciated that the general concepts outlined below in connection with visual renderings may be applied similarly to locate information contained in one or more electronic records generated by a locate device or a combined locate and marking device as well as landmark information contained in one or more electronic records generated by a locate device.

In block of the process if an electronic record has already been generated for the marking operation in which one or more underground facilities are marked and or environmental landmark information is acquired the record is examined to determine the geographic extents of the locate marks and or environmental landmarks to be visually rendered on a display device. In particular the processor may review the geo location data of all actuation data sets of the electronic record to determine e.g. based on the respective latitude and longitude coordinates of the available geo location data the maximum extents of the marking operation to be visually rendered.

The maximum extents of the marking operation may be determined in any of a variety of manners according to different exemplary implementations. For example in one exemplary implementation in block the processor may determine the centroid of all electronic locate marks and or environmental landmarks represented by respective actuation data sets of the electronic record to be displayed. The processor then determines the geographic extent of the collection of electronic locate marks and or environmental landmarks by determining one or more latitude longitude coordinate pairs from the available data having a greatest distance from the centroid. In one example the processor may determine a single farthest point from the centroid and a distance between this farthest point and the centroid serves as a radius of a circle that provides an extents area circle. In another example the farthest opposing corners of a rectangle around the centroid may be determined by assigning the centroid as the origin of a reference coordinate system and finding the coordinate pairs in opposing quadrants of the coordinate system having a greatest distance from the centroid e.g. the LAT LONG and LAT LONG coordinate pairs at a greatest distance from the origin to provide an extents area rectangle. Other types of polygons and closed shapes ovals may be employed to provide an extents area for the marking operation to be displayed.

Alternatively if an electronic record has not been previously generated and information received in essentially real time from the marking device or the combined locate and marking device is to be displayed in a display field a default extents area may be selected in advance based on any of a variety of criteria. For example address and or site description information provided in a ticket pursuant to which the marking operation is performed may provide a basis on which an extents area for the marking operation may be estimated a priori. Similarly as discussed further below in connection with an available digital image of the work site dig area may be employed to determine or estimate an initial extents area for the marking operation.

In block the extents area of the marking operation to be visually rendered is then mapped to an available display field of a display device using any appropriate scaling factor as necessary to ensure that all of the geo location data in the electronic record fits within the display field. For example in one exemplary implementation a transformation may be derived using information relating to the available display field e.g. a reference coordinate system using an appropriate scale for a given display field of a display device to map data points within the extents area to the available display field. In another aspect of this example a buffer area around the extents area may be added to provide one or more suitable margins for the displayed visual representation and or to accommodate different shapes of extents areas to the available display field of the display device and an appropriate transformation may be derived based on this optional additional buffer area.

Once a transformation is derived to map the marking operation extents area to the available display field of a display device in block one or more electronic locate marks and or one or more identifiers e.g. icons symbols marks shapes etc. is are rendered in the display field based on applying the transformation to the geo location data present in the data set of one or more corresponding actuation data sets of the electronic record. In one exemplary implementation one electronic locate mark is rendered in the display field for each actuation data set of an electronic record. With reference again to Table 6 and in one embodiment each actuation data set includes at least T1 geo location data for a start of an actuation of a marking device and one or more other pieces of geo location data during actuation. Using multiple pieces of geo location data per actuation data set an electronic locate mark may be rendered as a line in the display field e.g. so as to visually represent one of the physical locate marks or shown in . In another exemplary implementation an electronic locate mark may be rendered for each geo location data in a given entry such that multiple electronic locate marks correspond to one actuation e.g. a series of dots electronically rendered to graphically represent a line type physical locate mark . In one aspect as discussed above a given electronic locate mark may be rendered in a particular color and or line type to represent a type of underground facility represented by the mark e.g. as indicated by marking material information included in the electronic record .

As noted above while in one embodiment there may be a one to one correspondence between electronic locate marks rendered in a single or composite visual representation and physical locate marks placed in a dig area during a marking operation or there may be multiple electronic locate marks for a corresponding physical locate mark in yet other embodiments a single or composite visual representation may provide a variety of other indicators digital representations of marked underground facilities in a computer generated visual rendering. For example illustrates another example of a composite visual representation based on the same electronic record used to generate the composite visual representation of in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective marking operations. To this end in one exemplary implementation an additional step may be included in the process shown in in which the processor may process the marking geo location data in an electronic record by filtering averaging interpolating and or otherwise smoothing the data so as to connect successive discrete locate marks represented by the respective actuation data sets of the electronic record and thereby provide a substantially smooth continuous line for display.

Similarly filtering averaging interpolating processing and or otherwise smoothing of data may be applied to landmark information captured in landmark event entries. For example multiple event entries logged for a particular environmental landmark e.g. the four corners of a pedestal may be processed so as to provide a single point in a display field at which to display a symbol icon or other identifier for an environmental landmark. Such processing may include for example selecting any one of multiple geo location coordinates captured in multiple event entries as representative of the landmark location calculating a centroid of all points represented by captured coordinates pre filtering a collection of coordinates to eliminate significant outliers and subsequently determining a centroid of the remaining coordinates etc.

In the example of as also noted above different underground facility types may be indicated in different color lines and the different colors facility types may be derived from the electronic record e.g. based on the correlations provided in Table 7 . Furthermore in other aspects text indicators may be included in the visual representation and or other types of coding may be used different line styles such as patterns width bold etc. a succession of symbols or other graphic icons etc. to indicate different facility types and or some other aspect of a given facility e.g. the material used for a particular pipe conduit cable sheathing the diameter of a particular pipe conduit cable offsets to one or more environmental landmarks etc. . By way of example indicates that the four underground facilities in the composite visual representation correspond to a power line which may be rendered in the color red a first sewer line which may be rendered in the color green a second sewer line which also may be rendered in the color green and a telecommunications line which may be rendered in the color orange . An exemplary composite visual representation may include additional textual numeric and or graphic elements to provide other information available in the electronic record for the marking operations e.g. timestamp information ID information coordinates for location information offset indications etc. . For example in an offset of 3 feet is indicated between the fire hydrant and the sewer line .

In some marking operations a technician may use the marking device not only to mark an underground facility s placement path relative to the ground pavement or other surface but also to annotate the marking operation in some fashion. For example in some instances a technician actually writes with the marking device e.g. by actuating the marking device to dispense paint to provide text annotations offset indications arrows other symbols and the like on the ground pavement or other surface. Accordingly the electronic record for a marking operation may include one or more actuation data sets corresponding to actuations in which the technician was writing to annotate the marking operation in some fashion rather than marking the path of an underground facilities. In some cases providing such technician annotations on a visual representation of a marking operation may be desirable however in other instances such annotations may provide erratic markings on a visual representation in which case additional processing of geo location data or other information in the electronic record e.g. filtering averaging interpolating and or otherwise smoothing the data may be employed.

In yet another embodiment a single or composite visual representation of a marking operation including one or both of marking information and landmark information may rendered on a display device together with a digital image representative of at least a portion of a dig area at a work site such that one or more electronic locate marks and or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks appear in appropriate relative positions overlaid on the displayed digital image. illustrates yet another example of a composite visual representation albeit based on an electronic record different than that used to generate the visual representations of in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective different underground facilities marked and these lines are overlaid on a digital image of a dig area together with identifiers for environmental landmarks. It should be appreciated that although continuous lines representing underground facilities are depicted on a digital image in in other embodiments discrete electronic locate marks corresponding to successive actuations of a marking device or multiple discrete electronic locate marks per actuation may be overlaid on a digital image of the dig area.

In the embodiment of a number of different image sources and image types may be employed to provide the digital image on which a visual representation of a marking operation may be overlaid. For purposes of the present disclosure such a digital image also referred to herein as an input image may be any image represented by source data that is electronically processed e.g. the source data is in a computer readable format to display the image on a display device. An input image may include any of a variety of paper tangible image sources that are scanned e.g. via an electronic scanner or otherwise converted so as to create source data e.g. in various formats such as XML PDF JPG BMP etc. that can be processed to display the input image. An input image also may include an image that originates as source data or an electronic file without necessarily having a corresponding paper tangible copy of the image e.g. an image of a real world scene acquired by a digital still frame or video camera or other image acquisition device in which the source data at least in part represents pixel information from the image acquisition device .

In some exemplary implementations input images according to the present disclosure may be created provided and or processed by a geographic information system GIS that captures stores analyzes manages and presents data referring to or linked to location such that the source data representing the input image includes pixel information from an image acquisition device corresponding to an acquired real world scene or representation thereof and or spatial geographic information geo encoded information .

In view of the foregoing various examples of input images and source data representing input images according to the present disclosure to which the inventive concepts disclosed herein may be applied include but are not limited to 

It should also be appreciated that source data representing an input image may be compiled from multiple data information sources for example any two or more of the examples provided above for input images and source data representing input images or any two or more other data sources can provide information that can be combined or integrated to form source data that is electronically processed to display an image on a display device.

As noted above in some implementations an input image may be indexed to Global Positioning System GPS coordinates or another coordinate system that provides geo spatial positioning. An input image may include geo coding or other geographical identification metadata and may be provided in any computer readable format. An input image may also include images of map symbols such as roads and street names that may be superimposed upon or displayed separately from an underlying geographic area when the input image is displayed on a display device.

Based on the foregoing a digital image may be displayed in an available display field of a display device either before or after electronic locate marks and or identifiers for environmental landmarks are displayed in the available display field. For example in one implementation after the block in all or a portion of the digital image may be mapped to the available display field based on any relevant geographic information accompanying the digital image e.g. GPS coordinates to which the image is indexed . Alternatively the digital image may be mapped first to the available display field of the display device depending on appropriate scaling and or transformation parameters as would be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art and thereafter one or more electronic locate marks and or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks similarly may be mapped to the available display field in appropriate positions relative to the underlying digital image. In the example of a first visual representation of a gas line is depicted a second visual representation of a communication line is depicted and a third visual representation of an electric line is depicted on an aerial image of a residential dig area for purposes of illustration. As discussed above in connection with other embodiments these visual representations may be displayed in different colors and or line types to denote different types of underground facilities and or various attributes of a given facility. As also illustrated in other types of markings may be included as part of the displayed image including environmental landmarks such as junction boxes or transformers streets property boundaries tie downs reference lines between marked facilities and environmental landmarks and or property boundaries and their associated dimensions and one or more text boxes e.g. to indicate an address of the work site over the residence and the like.

As noted earlier it should be appreciated that the general concepts outlined above in connection with visual renderings may be applied similarly to locate information contained in event entries and or one or more electronic records generated by a locate device or a combined locate and marking device. For example in addition to or alternatively to one or both of marking information and landmark information an electronic representation of locate information e.g. geo location data relating to detection of one or more underground facilities may be visually rendered in a display field including overlaying such an electronic representation on a digital input image. In this manner a comprehensive visual representation of activity relating to a locate and marking operation may be generated. In various exemplary implementations locate information may be filtered interpolated smoothed or otherwise processed as discussed above in connection with marking information and landmark information. Additionally locate information and marking information if displayed together may be differentiated in a display field in any of a variety of manners e.g. different line types symbols or patterns different colors or shades of related colors artificially offset from each other in the display field if marking information and locate information overlap or are sufficiently close to each other in some instances etc. to allow for visual perception of both locate information and marking information.

To this end in one embodiment each of locate information marking information and landmark information if present in a computer aided visual rendering as well as any constituent information forming part of the locate information marking information and landmark information may be displayed as separate layers of the visual rendering such that a viewer of the visual rendering may turn on and turn off displayed information based on a categorization of the displayed information. shows a generic display device having a display field with exemplary content for purposes of explaining some concepts germane to display layers according to one embodiment. For example all locate information may be categorized generally under one layer designation locate layer and independently enabled or disabled for display e.g. hidden accordingly. Similarly all marking information may be categorized generally under another layer designation marking layer and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly and all landmark information may be categorized generally under yet another layer designation landmark layer and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly. Respective layers may be enabled or disabled for display in any of a variety of manners for example in one implementation a layer directory or layer legend pane may be included in the display field or as a separate window selectable from the display field of the visual rendering showing all available layers and allowing a viewer to select each available layer to be either displayed or hidden thus facilitating comparative viewing of layers.

Furthermore any of the above mentioned general categories for layers may have sub categories for sub layers such that each sub layer may also be selectively enabled or disabled for viewing by a viewer. For example under the general layer designation of marking layer different facility types that may have been marked during a marking operation and indicated in the marking information by color for example may be categorized under different sub layer designations e.g. designation for marking layer electric designation for marking layer gas etc. in this manner a viewer may be able to hide only the electric marking information while viewing the gas marking information or vice versa in addition to having the option to view or hide all marking information. As shown in the example of of the locate marking and landmark layers only the marking layer is enabled for display and amongst the illustrated sub layer designations only the electric sub layer of the marking layer is enabled for display. Accordingly using the exemplary composite visual representation shown in as a baseline for purposes of illustration only the power line appears in the electronic rendering A shown in as a constituent element of the electric sub layer of the marking layer. Sub layer designations similarly may be employed for the locate information and the landmark information e.g. designation for landmark layer water sewer designation for landmark layer CATV . Virtually any characteristic of the information available for display may serve to categorize the information for purposes of display layers or sub layers for example a locate sub layer designation of locate layer battery low may be employed to specifically enable or disable for display any data points in the locate information that were collected when locate status information indicated a low battery condition and as a result possibly suspect data .

Various examples of visual representations such as those illustrated in may be used for various purposes including but not limited to 

VII. Marking Devices Locate Devices or Combined Locate and Marking Devices Communicatively Coupled to a Mobile Portable Device

In another embodiment a marking device a locate device or a combined marking and locate device also collectively referred to herein as locate marking device according to the present invention may be equipped with or otherwise communicatively coupled to a mobile portable device hereafter a mobile device such as a cellular phone or personal digital assistant PDA that provides processing electronic storage electronic display user interface communication facilities and or other functionality for the locating equipment. Communicative coupling of a mobile device with locate marking devices may allow the intelligence and or various functionality of the mobile device to be used in place of or in addition to an onboard processor and or other onboard components e.g. such as those included in control electronics or control electronics .

More specifically in some embodiments a mobile device may be employed to implement the various functionality discussed above in connection with the processor the memory the communication interface the power source the user interface including the display and in some instances the timing system and or the location tracking system of an exemplary marking device and the corresponding components of a locate device and or a combined locate and marking device. To this end the mobile device itself may include one or more of a processor memory communication interface power source user interface timing system and or location tracking system e.g. to facilitate GPS enabled functionality . In some exemplary implementations the mobile device may provide essentially all of the processing and related functionality required to operate the locating equipment while in other implementations the mobile device may only provide some portion of the overall functionality e.g. a GPS enabled mobile device may be employed primarily for obtaining geo location data but not necessarily relied on substantively for processing power and or memory . In certain instances sensors on a mobile device may be used to collect information about a locate and or marking operation.

In yet other implementations the mobile device may provide redundant shared and or backup functionality for the locating equipment to enhance robustness and improve confidence in a locate and or marking operation. For example even though a locate marking device may include one or more of a processor memory communication interface power source user interface timing system and or location tracking system a mobile device communicatively coupled to or otherwise integrated with the locate marking device may include one or more corresponding components to provide redundant shared and or backup components and functionality. Examples of enhanced robustness provided by redundant components and or functionality of a mobile device include but are not limited to providing for data comparison to establish data integrity e.g. validation of geo location data by comparing data obtained by a location tracking system in the locate marking device to geo location data provided by a mobile device equipped with its own location tracking system calibration of various parameters power for various components e.g. a first power source of the locate marking device may be used to power recharge a second power source of the mobile device or vice versa backup memory storage backup communication interfaces support for multiple different communication protocols communication channels and or communication media.

In one embodiment all sensor functionality and processor functionality for a marking device may be provided by the mobile device only. For example a mobile device such as a smart phone may be attached to a mechanical marking wand to yield an intelligent marking device that can collect marking information and generate a data record of a marking operation. Such an embodiment is described below. In various exemplary implementations the functionality provided by the mobile device may be due at least in part to processor executable instructions or other applications executing on one or more hardware processors of the mobile device alternatively or in addition to local execution of instructions applications the mobile device may retrieve external instructions external applications and or other external information via one or more communication interfaces to provide functionality that facilitates operation of the locate marking device.

In various examples a mobile device may be mechanically and or electronically coupled to a locate marking device via an appropriate cradle or dock or otherwise integrated with or communicatively coupled to the locate marking device so as to permit one or more electronic signals to be communicated between the mobile device and one or more components of the locate marking device e.g. one or more signals indicative of operation of the locate marking device may be supplied to the mobile device . In some implementations a cradle may be appropriately configured such that one or more of a power connector and an I O connector on the mobile device engage with one or more complimentary connectors on the cradle upon insertion engagement of the mobile device in the cradle. The one or more complimentary connectors on the cradle in turn may be coupled to various signals provided by the locate marking device e.g. in the example of a marking device the actuation signal from the actuation system one or more signals provided by the marking material detection mechanism etc. may be coupled to one or more I O pins of the mobile device connector via the cradle . Additionally in some embodiments the cradle and or the locate marking device itself may include a battery pack and or any other power source for supplying power to and or for assisting the battery of the mobile device while the mobile device is docked to the locate marking device. In one example the local power pack may be used to prolong the battery life of the mobile device.

Various methods and apparatus for communicatively coupling mobile devices to locate marking devices in accordance with the present disclosure may allow different brands and or types of mobile devices to be physically secured to and or electrically coupled to a particular piece of locating equipment marking equipment or combination locate and marking device. In various implementations a cradle integrated into a locate marking device may be mobile device specific i.e. the cradle may be particularly configured such that the size and or connector positions are appropriate for a particular brand model of mobile device. Alternatively a universal cradle with an adjustable size and or adjustable connector locations e.g. sliding connectors along one or more sides of the cradle that may be mechanically locked in place may be coupled to the locate marking device so as to accommodate a variety of different mobile devices. In other examples a cradle or other docking arrangement may not require electrical connections integrated therein and one or more signals provided by the locate marking device may be communicated to the mobile device and vice versa via one or more wired connections e.g. a cable or wire or a wireless connection e.g. a Bluetooth connection . In yet other examples the mobile device need not be physically secured to the locate marking device but may be communicatively coupled to the locate marking device via one or more wired and or wireless connections.

In some implementations device specific cradles may be used to secure a mobile device to a locate marking device. The device specific cradles may be designed to each have a common mechanical fastening feature that permits each specific cradle to be fastened securely to a common mating feature on a locate marking device. The device specific cradles may be provided in a variety of shapes where a particular shape is designed to have a receptacle for securely attaching a particular style mobile device to the specific cradle. Device specific cradles may each be configured for holding a particular type of mobile device. For example one device specific cradle may provide a receptacle into which an Apple iPhone may be attached while another device specific cradle may provide a receptacle into which a Motorola Droid X device may be attached. The mobile device may be any mobile device that has at least a processing unit and a communication interface and preferably a user interface mechanism. Examples of mobile devices include but are not limited to any of a wide variety of mobile phones personal digital assistants PDA and or any other personal communication and or media devices such as the iPod Touch device or Motorola Droid devices.

In each device specific cradle may be associated with a certain brand and or style of mobile device. For example device specific cradle of may be particularly configured for holding a certain type of mobile device device specific cradle of may be particularly configured for holding a different type of mobile device and device specific cradle of may be particularly configured for holding yet another type of mobile device . Once a mobile device is inserted in its corresponding device specific cradle on the piece of locating equipment its processing capabilities user interface capabilities communication capabilities data storage capabilities and or any other capabilities may be used in combination with other components of the locate marking device to perform various locate and or marking functions discussed elsewhere herein.

Each device specific cradle may or may not be electrically coupled to one or more other components of the locating equipment e.g. for the marking device the actuation system the marking material detection mechanism etc. . In some embodiments each device specific cradle may include an input output I O connector for electrically connecting to its corresponding mobile device when the mobile device is secured within its device specific cradle. Alternatively a wireless communication link or a communication cable may be provided between the locate marking device and the mobile device that is secured within its device specific cradle.

In some implementations physical electrical coupling between a mobile device and a locate marking device may be for power only. For example a power source on a locate marking device may provide power to the mobile device through a power cable. Information may be exchanged between a mobile device and a locate marking device wirelessly. In some implementations of locate marking devices power only may be provided from a power source on the locate marking device e.g. a large rechargeable battery and no electronic information may be exchanged between the mobile device and the locate marking device.

In some embodiments any mobile device specific cradles and or universal cradles provided in connection with locating equipment may be removable replaceable and or exchangeable. For example the mobile device specific cradles and or universal cradles may be removed from the piece of locate marking device and then reattached as desired.

In other embodiments a mobile device may be docked to a locate marking device through mechanisms requiring less external hardware to be attached to the locate marking device. For example illustrate perspective views of a slot pocket and or pouch in a locate marking device for holding mobile devices. In some implementations hook and loop fastening material may be used to attach a mobile device in a pouch to a locate marking device. In one example shows a slot integrated into marking device into which a mobile device such as mobile device may be inserted. An electrical connection not shown may be integrated into a portion of slot e.g. along one or more sides and or the bottom of slot for connecting to mobile device . In another example shows a pouch that is secured for example to the side of the locate marking device. A mobile device such as mobile device may be inserted into pouch . Pouch may be sealable by for example a ziplock type of seal. A cable not shown such as cable of may be allowed to pass through the walls or through the seal of pouch for providing an electrical connection between the locate marking device and mobile device .

Any mobile device used in connection with a locate marking device and optionally the locate marking device itself may include a communication interface. For example the communication interfaces of the mobile device and the locate marking device may be any wired and or wireless communication interface by which information may be exchanged. Examples of wired communication interfaces may include but are not limited to USB ports RS232 connectors RJ45 connectors Ethernet and any combinations thereof. Examples of wireless communication protocols may include but are not limited to an Intranet connection Internet Bluetooth technology Wi Fi Wi Max IEEE 802.11 technology radio frequency RF Infrared Data Association IrDA compatible protocols Local Area Networks LAN Wide Area Networks WAN Shared Wireless Access Protocol SWAP any combinations thereof and other types of wireless networking protocols including proprietary protocols. Wireless communication may be carried out through RF transceivers installed in the locate marking device and mobile device. A communication interface may be established between a mobile device and locate marking device e.g. using necessary hardware and protocols to permit exchange of data and operational commands. For example data collected during a locate and or marking operation may be communicated to the mobile device. Commands to control a locate device may be entered using the mobile device and communicated to the locate device.

When a cable such as cable is to be used to facilitate a connection between a mobile device and a locate marking device as for example in and the cable may be particularly configured to provide a connection between the I O connector type of the locate marking device and the device specific I O connector type of the mobile device. For example the cable may be in the form of a phone adaptor with one end configured to connect to the I O connector of the locate marking device and the other end configured to connect to the I O connector of a specific type of mobile device. illustrates perspective views of examples of device specific phone adaptors for use in facilitating wired communication with a locate marking device.

Locate marking devices such as marking device may include a standard I O connector into which any phone adaptor may be plugged. For example each phone adaptor such as phone adaptor or may include a standard I O connector that is the counterpart to I O connector of the locate marking device. For example if I O connector of the locate marking device is a male I O connector I O connector of phone adaptors can be a corresponding female I O connector. Likewise if I O connector of the locate marking device is a female I O connector I O connector of phone adaptors can be a corresponding male I O connector.

In a specific example phone adaptor may be a USB based adaptor i.e. I O connector on the locate marking device may be a standard USB port and I O connector of phone adaptor may be a USB connector. Cable of and B is an example of a USB based phone adaptor .

At the other end of phone adaptor an I O connector may be particularly configured to connect with a certain type of mobile device. For example phone adaptor may include a device specific I O connector for connecting to a certain brand and or style of mobile device not shown . Phone adaptor may include a device specific I O connector for connecting to a different brand and or style of mobile device not shown . Phone adaptor may include a device specific I O connector for connecting to a yet another brand and or style of mobile device not shown .

When wired communications are used data exchange may be implemented using one or more pins on a selected data cable connector. Data exchange may be in accordance with specifications established by a manufacturer of a mobile device. For example a data and power connector for most Android based devices typically is a standard micro USB connector and data may be exchange over two or more pins or wires of the USB connector. Connectors for other cellular phone PDAs noted above may have various proprietary formats pin layouts. An exemplary pin layout for an Apple iPhone is given in Table 20.

The pins 1 30 for the iPhone listed in Table 20 may be accessed through a dock connector or multi pin cable connector. As can be seen from Table 20 data may be exchanged over pins 3 4 8 10 12 13 22 24 28. In some implementations data exchange may be carried out over one or more available interfaces e.g. USB or USB and FireWire for the iPhone.

In some embodiments wired communication may be complemented or replaced altogether with any of various forms of wireless communication between a mobile device and a locate marking device. For example illustrates a user worn mobile device that is in communication with a locate marking device. The locate marking device may include a communication interface which may be any wired and or wireless communication interface as described above. also shows a locate technician having a belt worn mobile device such as mobile device . That is mobile device may be installed in a standard belt worn holster . In this example mobile device may communicate with the locate marking device via for example Wi Fi communication such as Bluetooth communication. In various implementations the control electronics of the locate marking device may or may not include processor memory and or user interface components if any of these are included similar components of the mobile device nonetheless may provide advantageous redundancy e.g. for convenience of the technician .

In operation a mobile device may support communication between two or more devices. As an example during a locate and or marking operation a mobile device may be adapted to support communication between a locate marking device and a remote computer. The remote computer may be at the locate site or at a central office. Communication between the mobile device and remote computer may be for example via a WiFi connection. Such an embodiment can provide substantially real time monitoring and or assistance by a remote person for a locate and or marking operation. For example if a locate technician encounters difficulty in finding a facility a remote person may check historical records and provide real time guidance to the technician based on the technician s location at the site. As another example a technician inaccurately marking a facility may be detected in real time by a remote person e.g. by sounding or displaying an alarm signal at the remote computer and the technician can be immediately advised of the error.

It should be understood that the foregoing figures and descriptions illustrate non limiting examples and any suitable mechanism may be used for securing a mobile device to a locate marking device and for establishing a communication link. Additionally any mechanism for holding a mobile device may be ruggedized and or weatherproofed.

As mentioned above once a mobile device is installed in universal cradle on the locate marking device the mobile device s processing capabilities user interface capabilities communication capabilities data storage capabilities sensor capabilities and or any other capabilities may be used in combination with or in place of other components of the locate marking device to perform various functions discussed elsewhere herein. The system may be adapted such that a technician operating the locate marking device uses only the user interface of the mobile device in some embodiments. Additionally the locate marking device mobile device system may include enhancements to the user interface and or other operational features in connection with a variety of sensors that may be integrated and or communicatively coupled to the system for example as described in co pending U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 703 958 entitled Marking Apparatus Having Enhanced Features for Underground Facility Marking Operations and Associated Methods and Systems filed Feb. 11 2010 and in co pending U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 704 087 entitled Locate Apparatus Having Enhanced Features for Underground Facility Locate Operations and Associated Methods and Systems filed on Feb. 11 2010 both of which are incorporated by reference.

As noted above in some implementations the mobile device may provide essentially all of the processing and related functionality required to operate the locate marking device or only provide some portion of the overall functionality also the mobile device may provide redundant shared and or backup functionality for the locate marking device to enhance robustness. As an example and with reference again to a mobile device used in connection with a marking device in accordance with the present disclosure may be appropriately programmed with the marking data algorithm so as to log and generate electronic records of various marking information which records may be formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed on the mobile device and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server for storage processing and or analysis.

In one example one or more pieces of geo location data e.g. from a GPS receiver which may be integrated with the mobile device may be collected and logged on the mobile device per actuation of a marking device e.g. a trigger pull to dispense marking material in response to receipt by the mobile device of the actuation signal . Additionally information provided by marking material detection mechanism may be communicated to the mobile device either upon actuation or otherwise. Furthermore a computer generated image or other visual representation of the marking operation as discussed above may be electronically rendered in a display field of the mobile device based on logged marking information essentially in real time as the marking operation is conducted and or recreated thereafter based on one or more stored electronic records. A real time image of the marking operation may also be rendered on a remote computer in communication with the mobile device.

Various examples of marking data algorithms according to the concepts discussed herein may be available as applications that may be downloaded to the mobile device and selectable operable from the user interface of the mobile device such that the mobile device may also be used for other more conventional functions e.g. telephone calls email web access browsing etc. in addition to specific functionality pursuant to execution of a marking data algorithm when used in connection with the marking device. The foregoing concepts apply similarly to a locate device or a combined locate and marking device with which a mobile device is communicatively coupled and or integrated.

Additional mobile device applications may also be useful for locate and or marking operations. For example a color identification application using image recognition may be in operation on the mobile device to determine the color of marking material dispensed during a marking operation as well as determine a type of surface on which the marking material is dispensed. As another example a product identification application may be in operation on the mobile device e.g. by imaging a bar code on a paint can to identify the color of paint to be dispensed for marking a facility. Further a velocity application may be in operation on the mobile device to monitor a speed at which marking material is dispensed or at which locate information is obtained.

According to another aspect of the present invention a mobile device and or locate marking device includes one or more environmental and or operational sensors which constitute additional examples of input devices from which locate and or marking information may be derived. In particular one or more environmental sensors associated with a mobile device and or locate marking device may provide a variety of environmental information in connection with use of the locate marking device similarly one or more operational sensors associated with the mobile device and or locate marking device may provide a variety of operational information in connection with use of the locate marking device. One or both of such environmental information and operational information may constitute all or a portion of locate and or marking information and may be employed in any of the manners described above in connection with locate and or marking information. In particular environmental information and or operational information may be logged stored in local memory of a mobile device and or locate marking device transferred to and stored in internet accessible memory formatted in various manners processed and or analyzed at the mobile device itself and or locate marking device itself and or transmitted to another device e.g. a remote computer server an internet storage site cellular telephone personal digital assistant PDA etc. for storage processing and or analysis.

As used herein environmental sensors are those which sense some condition of the environment in which the locate marking device is present but need not sense a condition of the locate marking device itself. Examples of environmental conditions which may be sensed include but are not limited to temperature humidity light and altitude among others. Environmental sensors may be included with the locate marking device or the mobile device for one or more of various reasons. For example information provided by one or more of the environmental sensors may be used to assess whether a locate and or marking operation was or is being performed in suitable environmental conditions e.g. within accepted environmental tolerances . Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more environmental sensors may be used to interact with the technician operating the locate marking device for example by issuing a notification or warning signal to the technician if the sensed environmental condition is outside of an acceptable range i.e. out of tolerance . Also the information from the environmental sensor s may trigger an action or alteration of the locate marking device such as activating enabling or disabling a particular component of the locate marking device. Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more environmental sensors may augment other information collected by the locate marking device such as any of the types of information described above as being collected by a locate marking device according to various embodiments herein. In some instances information from two or more of the environmental sensors may be used in combination examples of which are described in detail below.

As used herein operational sensors are those which sense some operating condition of the locate marking device. Examples of such conditions include but are not limited to the angle of inclination of the locate marking device the direction or heading of the locate marking device a pressure applied to the locate marking device and or some characteristic of motion of the locate marking device e.g. the speed at which the locate marking device is moving the acceleration of the locate marking device etc. among others. Operational sensors may be included with the locate marking device for one or more of various reasons. For example information provided by one or more of the operational sensors may be used to assess whether a locate marking device was or is operating appropriately during a locate and or marking operation or whether the locate marking device was or is being operated e.g. both electronically and or physically manipulated appropriately by the technician e.g. within accepted tolerances or according to protocols . Additionally or alternatively information from one or more operational sensors may be used to detect patterns of operation of the technician such as technician signatures in using manipulating the locate marking device e.g. characteristic movements unique to the technician . Additionally or alternatively information from one or more operational sensors may be used to interact with the technician for example by issuing a notification or warning signal to the technician in response to the detected operational characteristic falling outside of an acceptable range. Also the information from the operational sensor s may trigger an action or alteration of the locate marking device such as activating enabling or disabling a particular component of the locate marking device. Additionally or alternatively information provided by one or more operational sensors may augment other information collected by the locate marking device such as any of the types of information previously described herein in connection with other embodiments. Other uses of data provided by one or more operational sensors are also possible and contemplated in the various aspects described herein. In some instances information from two or more operational sensors may be used in combination examples of which are described below. Furthermore information from one or more operational sensors may be used in combination with information from one or more environmental sensors as also described further below.

It should be appreciated that some of the sensors described herein may be considered both environmental and operational sensors either because the sensor senses both an environmental condition and an operating condition of the locate marking device i.e. the sensor senses more than one condition or because a single condition sensed by the sensor may be considered both an environmental condition and an operating condition. For example an image capture device may be considered both an environmental sensor e.g. the image capture device may capture an image of the surrounding environment and an operational sensor e.g. the image capture device may capture an image of some action the technician has taken for example an image of the manner in which the technician is holding the locate marking device . Furthermore the operation of a sensor may change over time. For example a sensor may be configured at one time to measure an internal operating temperature and at a different time to measure an outside ambient temperature. Thus it should be appreciated that while the sensors described below are categorized generally as being either environmental or operational for purposes of illustrating some exemplary implementations the categories are not mutually exclusive and such categorization is not limiting unless otherwise stated.

Environmental and operation sensors utilized in a locate and or marking operation may be physically located on a locate marking device as well as or alternatively on in a mobile device coupled to a locate marking device. In some implementations sensor data from both a locate marking device and mobile device may be recorded during a locate and or marking operation. In some embodiments only sensor data from a mobile device may be recorded. In some implementations sensors may be mounted only on the locate marking device and be communicatively coupled to the mobile device e.g. accelerometers and or gyroscopes may be mounted on the located marking device and data provided to the mobile device .

As depicted in the mobile device may comprise control electronics environmental sensors B and a power source . The mobile device may additionally include operational sensors in some implementations as depicted in .

With respect to environmental sensors non limiting examples of suitable environmental sensors include a temperature sensor e.g. one or more of an ambient temperature sensor and a surface temperature sensor e.g. a temperature sensor for sensing a temperature of a surface toward which the locate marking device is pointed or oriented a humidity sensor a light sensor an altitude sensor an image capture device e.g. a camera and an audio recorder or acoustic sensor. This list is not exhaustive however as other types of environmental sensors may be included as appropriate to sense various environmental conditions of interest.

The ambient temperature sensor may be configured to sense the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the locate marking device . The ambient temperature may be a useful piece of information for example in determining whether the temperature is adverse to performance of the locate operation which may occur when the temperature is too hot or too cold. For example in some embodiments it may be preferable to operate the locate marking device only within a predetermined ambient temperature range between 20 F. and 110 F. although other ranges are possible. In addition as described further below the ambient temperature may be useful in combination with one or more other types of environmentally sensed inputs such as humidity in evaluating the conditions in which a locate operation is performed.

The ambient temperature sensor may be any suitable temperature sensor such as an infrared sensor and may be an analog or digital temperature sensor that utilizes one or more thermistors as the various aspects described herein relating to a locate marking device including an ambient temperature sensor are not limited to using any particular type of temperature sensor. According to one embodiment the temperature sensor may be part of a combined temperature and humidity sensor such as the HS 2000V from Precon of Memphis Tenn. In some embodiments the ambient temperature sensor may be suitable to operate between 40 F. and 125 F. or over any other suitable range which in some embodiments may encompass the expected temperatures to which the locate marking device may be exposed during normal operation.

The surface temperature sensor may be configured to sense the temperature of the surface toward which the locate marking device is pointing or oriented e.g. the ground under the locate marking device . The temperature of the surface may be useful information for various reasons. Thus as a non limiting example information from the surface temperature sensor may be used to assess whether the locate and or marking operation was or is being performed in such recommended temperature conditions.

The surface temperature sensor may be any suitable type of sensor for determining surface temperature such as an infrared temperature sensor or any other suitable type of temperature sensor. In some embodiments the surface temperature sensor may be configured to operate across a range of temperatures encompassing all expected surface temperatures to be encountered during normal operation of the locate marking device. For example in one embodiment the surface temperature sensor may operate between 40 F. and 125 F. although other temperature ranges are also possible.

The humidity sensor may be configured to sense the humidity of the environment in which the locate marking device is used and in some embodiments may provide a relative humidity measurement e.g. 0 to 100 humidity . Such information may be useful alone or in combination with other information in determining whether for example the environment is too humid for performance of the locate and or marking operation. The humidity information provided by humidity sensor may be used to assess whether a locate and or marking operation was or is being performed within acceptable humidity tolerances. The humidity sensor may be any suitable type of humidity sensor as the type is not limiting. According to one embodiment the humidity sensor may be part of a combined temperature and humidity sensor such as the HS 2000V from Precon of Memphis Tenn.

The sensing of temperature and humidity conditions can be more particularly important for marking operations in which paint is dispensed onto the surface to be marked. High humidity and or low or high temperatures can result in poor adhesion of marking paint to the surface to be marked.

The light sensor may be configured to sense the intensity flux or illuminance of ambient light in the vicinity of the locate marking device . Such information may be useful for example to assess whether a locate and or marking operation was or is being performed in suitable lighting conditions e.g. whether there was sufficient light to allow for accurate performance of a locate and or marking operation whether the area surrounding the locate and or marking operation is sufficiently lit to ensure worker safety etc. . The light sensor may be any suitable type of light sensor. In one embodiment the light sensor is a cadmium sulfide CdS photocell which is a photoresistor device whose resistance decreases with increasing incident light intensity. Such a device may provide a resistance or voltage measurement as its output indicative of measured flux. However other types of light sensors may alternatively be used e.g. any suitable photodiode commercially available. One non limiting example of a suitable photocell is the PDV P5001 from Advanced Photonix Inc. of Ann Arbor Mich.

The units output by the light sensor may depend on whether the light sensor is sensing light intensity light flux or illuminance. For example the output may be in candela for light intensity lumen for flux or lux for illuminance. According to one embodiment target values for illuminance for accurate performance of a marking operation may be between approximately 1 000 lux and 100 000 lux although other ranges may be appropriate based on a particular location and type of locate and or marking operation being performed. According to one embodiment the output may be converted to a percentage between 0 and 100 for example in which 0 corresponds to darkness and 100 corresponds to full sunlight. Other outputs may alternatively be produced.

In some implementations the output from temperature humidity or light sensors may be displayed visually on a display of the locate marking device or mobile device in the form of a meter e.g. a needle deflection or an bar scale deflection . An acceptable range of operation may be indicated on the display also so that the user may determine immediately whether a deflection of a needle or bar scale falls within an acceptable operating range.

According to one embodiment the locate marking device further comprises a light source such as a flashlight or light emitting diode LED torch. The light source may be activated manually e.g. by the technician or may be coupled to the light sensor e.g. directly coupled or coupled through one or more components such as processor and activated automatically in response to the light sensor sensing an unsatisfactorily low lighting condition e.g. by receiving a signal from the processor of control electronics or or by directly receiving an output signal of the light sensor . The threshold light level for such automatic activation may be any suitable level non limiting examples of which include any level at which the technician may have difficulty seeing and therefore performing the locate and or marking operation and any predetermined level below which technician safety may be comprised. Information about such activation of the light source e.g. the occurrence of the activation the time of activation the duration etc. may be stored in local memory memory of the mobile device and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

The altitude sensor may be configured to measure the altitude of the locate marking device and may be any suitable type of altitude sensor for doing so. The altitude at which a locate and or marking operation is performed may impact the performance of the locate and or marking operation and worker safety among other considerations. Thus information about the altitude may be useful for a variety of reasons. The output of the altitude sensor may be in any suitable units and in some embodiments provides an altitude with respect to sea level. For example the altitude sensor may provide an altitude in meters miles feet or any other suitable units.

The image capture device may be positioned on the locate marking device to capture an image of the environment surrounding the locate marking device or may be configured or configurable in any suitable manner to capture any type of image of interest. According to one embodiment a technician may be meant to take a picture of a job site and or of an environmental landmark at the job site. Thus inclusion of an image capture device in the locate marking device may facilitate compliance with such protocols.

The image capture device may be capable of taking still images video images or both as the various aspects described herein relating to locate marking devices including an image capture device are not limited in this respect. Thus the image capture device may be any suitable type of image capture device and in some embodiments may be a type that is suitable for use in a portable device such as but not limited to the types of digital cameras that may be installed in portable phones wide angle digital cameras 360 degree digital cameras infrared IR cameras and the like. In some implementations a wide angle lens and automatic zoom may be utilized to maximize the coverage area of each image. In various embodiments an image capture device is incorporated on the mobile device .

The output of the image capture device may include various information. The output may include all or part of a captured image. Additionally or alternatively the output may include information about the settings and or operation of the image capture device such as any one or more of resolution frame rate for video images flash status i.e. flash used or not used image size video sequence duration zoom setting etc.

In those embodiments in which the image capture device is a digital device the images may be stored in local memory memory of the mobile device and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer . The images may be in any proprietary or standard image file format e.g. JPEG TIFF BMP etc. . Furthermore the images may be associated with a specific job a geographic position and an exact time in some embodiments for example by flagging the image based on the time at which it was taken the location at which it was taken and or the job during which it was taken. In one embodiment each captured image may be cached and transmitted with all other captured data from one or more other sensors input devices.

The environmental sensors may further comprise an audio recorder which may be used to capture audio input from a technician and or from the environment e.g. sounds in the vicinity of the locate marking device . Thus in one embodiment the technician may for example dictate notes relating to the performance of the locate and or marking operation such as describing visible landmarks in the area of the locate and or marking operation notes about performance of the locate marking device or any other notes which may be relevant to performance of a locate and or marking operation. In one embodiment the audio recorder may record sounds from the environment such as passing cars planes etc. Such recordings may be useful for example in assessing whether a technician was at the intended location of the locate and or marking operation. For example if a passing train is evident from the recording and the intended location is not near a train track the recording may provide evidence that the technician was in the wrong location.

The audio recorder may be an analog or digital device or devices. For example in one embodiment the audio recorder may be an analog recorder configured to receive an analog input signal e.g. from a microphone and store the analog signal. According to another embodiment the audio recorder may be a digital audio recorder including any suitable combination of components for receiving an analog signal e.g. from a microphone converting the analog signal to a digital signal performing any suitable digital signal processing e.g. filtering amplifying converting to text etc. and storing the digital information. According to one embodiment the audio recorder may include a dedicated digital audio processor to perform those functions recited or any other suitable functions. It should be appreciated from the foregoing that a microphone not shown in may be associated with the audio recorder to provide the audio input to the audio recorder.

According to one embodiment for example in which a technician may dictate notes the audio processing of the audio input may include performing speech recognition e.g. speech to text generation . Such functionality may be provided by suitable speech recognition software executing on a dedicated audio processor or in any other suitable manner. Any generated text may be for example displayed on a display of the locate marking device or a display of the mobile device or may be stored for later display on a separate device.

The recordings provided by the audio recorder may be stored in a dedicated audio memory in local memory of control electronic in memory of the mobile device and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer . In those embodiments in which the audio recorder is a digital audio recorder the audio files may be in any standard or proprietary audio file format e.g. WAV MP3 etc. .

Although not illustrated in the communication interface provided by control electronics or a communication interface of the mobile device may also serve as or enable another environmental sensor. According to one embodiment the locate marking device may be internet enabled and information may be received via the communication interface over the internet. According to one embodiment information about an environmental condition may be received via the communication interface. For example temperature information or humidity information among others may be received over the internet via communication interface. In such instances the received temperature or humidity information may augment any temperature and humidity information collected by a temperature and humidity sensor of the locate marking device or may replace such information such that in some embodiments the locate marking device may not include a physical temperature or humidity sensor. Thus it should be appreciated that a communication interface of the locate marking device or of the mobile device may serve as a virtual sensor by receiving environmental information of interest not being limited to temperature and humidity.

It should be appreciated from the foregoing as well as the further discussion below that environmental information may be collected for various purposes. According to one embodiment the environmental information may be useful for assessing a locate marking device or locate and or marking operation. According to another embodiment the environmental information may be useful for assessing the conditions in which marking material is being dispensed. As previously explained locate and or marking operations may involve the use of a locate marking device to detect a facility location and a marking device to mark the facility location for example by dispensing a marking material. The environmental information sensed by the environmental sensors may be useful for assessing the conditions in which marking material is being dispensed in those situations in which a marking device is being used in connection with the locate marking device. Some marking materials e.g. paint for example may have preferred temperature ranges and humidity levels among other conditions in which they may be dispensed. Thus environmental information may facilitate determination of whether a marking material was or is being dispensed in suitable environmental conditions.

As explained above another type of input device which may be included with a locate marking device and or locate transmitter is an operational sensor. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention and as shown in the locate marking device may include one or more operational sensors A for sensing one or more operating conditions or characteristics of the locate marking device.

One or more operational temperature sensors may be configured to sense any temperature of interest with respect to the locate marking device . For example it may be desirable in some embodiments to monitor the temperature of the processing circuitry of the locate marking device such as the temperature of the processor of control electronics . Alternatively it may be desirable in some embodiments to monitor the temperature of other components of the locate marking device for example the temperature of one of the other operational sensors . Thus it should be appreciated that a plurality of operational temperature sensors may be included and arranged to sense any operating temperatures of interest of the locate marking device . In this manner the operating temperatures of one or more components of the locate marking device may be monitored and an alert or notification may be generated e.g. by the control electronics and provided to the technician if one of the operating temperatures is determined to be outside of an acceptable tolerance for example if a component is overheating. Alternatively the temperature from one or more operational temperature sensors may be used to calibrate or compensate data or signals provided by any one of the other sensors which may have a temperature dependent output.

The temperature sensor s may be any suitable temperature sensor such as a temperature dependent variable resistor or any other type of temperature sensor suitable for measuring the temperature of the components of interest of the locate marking device. The temperature sensor may be configured to operate over any suitable temperature range of interest which in one embodiment may be from 40 F to 125 F although other temperature ranges may be employed in other embodiments.

The compass may be configured to determine the direction in which the locate marking device is facing and therefore may be positioned at one of various suitable locations. For example according to one embodiment the compass may be positioned toward the top of the locate marking device and aligned such that the compass identifies the direction toward which the front of the locate marking device points i.e. the direction in which the locate marking device faces when held by the technician . The heading information provided by the compass may be provided in degrees or in any other suitable units and may be provided relative to a reference direction e.g. relative to true North . According to one embodiment the compass may be initially calibrated to true North such that subsequent heading readings may be relative to true North.

The heading information provided by the compass may be useful to determine a direction in which the technician moves during a locate and or marking operation. Such information may be particularly useful in instances in which the location tracking system does not provide a signal or a sufficiently accurate signal to monitor the technician s movements. The compass may be any suitable type of compass including analog or digital and may provide any suitable readout. According to one embodiment the compass is a digital compass which provides a heading of the locate marking device . According to one embodiment the compass may include one or more gyroscopes. According to one embodiment the compass is an OS4000 T solid state tilt compensated nano compass available from OceanServer Technology Inc. of Fall River Mass.

The inclinometer may be any suitable inclinometer configurable to measure an angle of inclination of the locate marking device . According to one embodiment the inclinometer may provide an angle with respect to ground. According to one embodiment the inclinometer may be a multi axis digital device and may sense angles with respect to horizontal and or vertical planes. The inclinometer may provide a voltage as an output signal indicative of the angle of inclination. According to some embodiments the inclinometer may have an output range spanning 30 degrees e.g. with respect to ground although other ranges may alternatively be provided by some inclinometers.

The inclinometer may be positioned toward the top of the locate marking device for example near where the technician may hold the locate marking device during use. Alternatively according to another embodiment the inclinometer may be positioned substantially near the tip of the locate marking device i.e. the end of the locate marking device held proximate the ground when the locate marking device is in use . Other locations for the inclinometer with respect to the locate marking device are also possible.

The information provided by the inclinometer may be useful for one or more of various purposes. For example according to one embodiment the information about the angle of the locate marking device may be useful in determining whether the technician is appropriately using the locate marking device e.g. for determining whether the locate marking device is being held at a suitable angle relative to the surface e.g. the ground under which a facility is disposed or onto which marking material is to be dispensed and in some instances may therefore be used to disable part of the locate marking device e.g. detection electronics or marking actuation if the technician is holding the locate marking device at an inappropriate angle. According to another embodiment as described in further detail below in connection with the information about the angle of the locate marking device may be used to determine the location of one point of the locate marking device relative to a second point of the locate marking device e.g. for use in determining the relative positioning of the tip of the locate marking device compared to the top of the locate marking device .

One or more accelerometers may be configured to sense the acceleration of the locate marking device and may provide an output in terms of g force or in any other suitable units. Such information may be useful for example in assessing whether a technician is appropriately using e.g. physically moving or manipulating the locate marking device . For example there may be predetermined acceptable acceleration ranges associated with normal operation of the locate marking device e.g. associated with the typical sweeping motion of a locate receiver as the technician scans for a buried facility and therefore the accelerometer s may provide information which may be used to assess whether a technician is operating the locate marking device within those acceptable ranges. In addition any acceleration data provided by the accelerometer s may be integrated to obtain velocity data and or integrated twice to obtain data about distance traveled e.g. via appropriate functionality included in the locate data algorithm or other algorithm executed by the processor or by an application in operation on the mobile device either of which integration results may be useful for a variety of reasons.

The accelerometer s may be any suitable accelerometer for sensing the acceleration of the locate marking device and may provide any suitable outputs. According to one embodiment the accelerometer may be a 3 axis accelerometer providing an indication of the acceleration of the locate marking device along three orthogonal axes. The output of each axis may be a frequency e.g. in Hz or may be converted to units of g. For example in one embodiment the accelerometer may be a 3 axis accelerometer that outputs a signal ranging from 0.5 Hz 550 Hz for the z axis from 0.5 Hz 1600 Hz for the x axis and from 0.5 Hz 1600 Hz for the y axis. Again the accelerometer may alternatively provide an output in terms of g or any other suitable units. In one exemplary implementation an accelerometer may be an ADXL 330KCPZ RL accelerometer available from Analog Devices of Norwood Mass. In some exemplary implementations the accelerometer may output acceleration data whereas in other implementations the accelerometer may output velocity data along each of the three axes as well as the orientation of the accelerometer.

In addition to providing acceleration data an accelerometer may be operated as an inclinometer according to known techniques see e.g. description at http www.tilt china.com uploadPDF How to use an accelerometer as an inclinometer.pdf viewed on Jan. 27 2010 and prepared by Shanghai Vigor Technology Development Co. . Thus according to one embodiment of the present invention a locate marking device may include an accelerometer configured to function as an inclinometer and therefore provide a measure of inclination of the locate marking device.

Furthermore as explained in greater detail below the locate marking device may comprise a plurality of accelerometers located at different positions with respect to the locate marking device. Information from such accelerometers may be useful for example in assessing the relative motion of one portion e.g. the tip of the locate marking device with respect to a second portion e.g. the top of the locate marking device for example using the techniques described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008 0255795 A1 published Oct. 16 2008 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. According to one such non limiting embodiment one accelerometer may be positioned near the tip of the locate marking device and a second accelerometer may be positioned near the top of the locate marking device. Both may be 3 axis accelerometers. Such an arrangement may also be used to determine the location of the tip of the locate marking device relative to the location of the top of the locate marking device as explained below in connection with .

Additionally the data output by one or both accelerometers may be used to monitor for out of tolerance operation of the locate marking device such as improper manipulation of the locate marking device by the technician. For example acceleration data from either accelerometer may be indicative of whether the locate marking device is being swung thrown or dropped among other things. For example acceleration values from either accelerometer above some threshold value for a sufficient duration e.g. for one second or greater or any other suitable duration may be indicative of the locate marking device being thrown or dropped. The threshold value of acceleration indicative of such behavior may be different for the two accelerometers. Similarly detection of acceleration values deviating from an expected or target pattern may be indicative of misuse of the locate marking device. In response to detecting such manipulation of the locate marking device various actions may be taken such as generating an alert logging an event disabling the actuation system and or detection electronics of the locate marking device.

Moreover a locate marking device may be provided with two accelerometers to monitor whether the locate marking device is being held in a satisfactory manner during use. For example it may be preferable for a locate marking device to be maintained at a substantially perpendicular angle relative to ground as a technician is locating or marking even when the technician is moving e.g. sweeping or swinging the locate marking device. It should be appreciated that when operated in such a manner the top of the locate marking device and the tip of the locate marking device may exhibit similar acceleration characteristics e.g. peaks in acceleration at the same time e.g. at the same points of a swinging motion minimum values of acceleration at the same time e.g. at the same points of a swinging motion etc. By positioning an accelerometer toward the tip of the locate marking device and another toward the top of the locate marking device the resulting acceleration data may be indicative of whether the technician is holding the locate marking device perpendicular to ground or otherwise properly manipulating the locate marking device. Other uses for multiple accelerometers on a locate marking device are also possible and the examples listed above are non limiting.

The operational sensors may further comprise a yaw rate sensor which may be configured to sense the yaw rate i.e. a twisting motion of the locate marking device. The yaw rate sensor may be any suitable yaw rate sensor and may provide its output in any suitable units for example in degrees per second degrees sec . One non limiting example of a suitable yaw rate sensor is an ADXRS610BBGZ RL gyro sensor from Analog Devices of Norwood Mass. According to another embodiment a yaw rate measurement may be provided by some types of compasses such that a combination compass and yaw rate sensor may be used. The yaw rate sensor may be positioned at any suitable location on the locate marking device to detect yaw rate.

The proximity sensor may be configured to measure the distance from any point of interest of the locate marking device to a point of interest in its surroundings. For example in one embodiment the proximity sensor may be positioned at the tip of the locate marking device and may be oriented to determine the distance between the tip of the locate marking device and any surface e.g. a target surface of interest such as the ground a landmark a wall etc. Alternatively in one embodiment the proximity sensor may be positioned toward the top of the locate marking device and oriented to determine a distance between the top of the locate marking device and the target surface e.g. ground . Other configurations are also possible.

Information about the distance from the locate marking device to any surrounding surface may be useful for one of various reasons. For example such information may be useful in assessing whether a technician is properly operating the locate marking device. As a non limiting example there may be predetermined acceptable distances between the locate marking device and the surface under which a facility is located when scanning for the facility or onto which marking material is to be dispensed. As an example it may be preferable in some embodiments to hold the locate marking device between one and twelve inches from the surface. The proximity sensor may be used to determine whether the technician is maintaining the locate marking device at an acceptable distance from the surface. Alternatively according to another embodiment and as described in greater detail below the distance of a portion of the locate marking device from the ground may be useful in determining the distance between two points of the locate marking device.

The proximity sensor may be any suitable type of proximity sensor e.g. any commercially available proximity sensor including an analog or digital device. In one embodiment proximity sensor may be a Sharp GP2D120 short range IR distance sensor from Sharp Electronics Corporation Mahwah N.J. and is able to take a substantially continuous distance reading and return a corresponding analog voltage with a range of about 1.6 inches to about 12 inches. Such a proximity sensor may be suitable for example when the sensor is used to sense the distance from the tip of the locate marking device to the ground since such a distance may typically be less than about 12 inches. According to another embodiment the proximity sensor may be a sonar device. Other types of proximity sensors may also be suitably used.

The pressure sensor may be configured to sense any pressure of interest with respect to the locate marking device. For example according to one embodiment it may be desirable to detect the pressure applied to a handle of the locate marking device e.g. handle in for instance to determine whether a technician is holding the locate marking device and if so whether it is being held appropriately. Accordingly a pressure sensor may be positioned in the handle of the locate marking device in one non limiting embodiment and configured to detect the pressure applied to the handle. According to another embodiment it may be desirable to determine the pressure applied to an actuation system of the locate marking device for example if the actuation system is a trigger e.g. actuator in . Accordingly a pressure sensor may be configured to determine the pressure applied to the trigger or other actuation mechanism in those embodiments in which the locate marking device includes such a trigger or actuation mechanism. According to one embodiment the locate marking device may include multiple pressure sensors for example one for determining the pressure applied to a handle of the locate marking device and one for determining a pressure applied to an actuation system of the locate marking device. However any number of pressure sensors may be included and they may be configured to sense any pressure of interest with respect to the locate marking device. The pressure sensor may be any suitable type of pressure sensor for detecting the pressure of interest.

The locate marking device may further include device health monitoring capability. Characteristics of the health of the locate marking device which may be the subject of monitoring include but are not limited to battery life battery drain level battery charging capacity wireless signal strength in those embodiments in which the locate marking device has wireless capabilities network connectivity operating temperature available memory and the status of any one or more input devices of the locate marking device such as an accelerometer location tracking system e.g. GPS receiver image capture device light sensor etc. To this end the locate marking device may include hardware and or software configured to serve the health monitoring purpose.

According to one embodiment the locate marking device may include a processor e.g. processor of control electronics or a processor of mobile device configured to run a device health software program or application to process the inputs from one or more operational sensors such as operational temperature sensor to assess whether those inputs indicate the locate marking device is operating appropriately. According to another embodiment the locate marking device may include dedicated device health hardware such as device health sensor which may provide data that is processed by a device health software program for example executing on processor to assess the health of the locate marking device. Non limiting examples of device health sensor include a voltmeter and an ammeter among others.

In one embodiment data provided by the device health sensor may indicate that a low battery condition is present during the locate and or marking operation and thus it may be determined that the operations of the locate marking device are not reliable. Other device conditions such as wireless signal strength e.g. in those embodiments in which the locate marking device and or mobile device is are wirelessly coupled to an external device such as remote computer available memory temperature of one or more components of the locate marking device power connection of one or more components of the locate marking device or other conditions of the locate marking device may be monitored by a device health sensor. Thus it should be appreciated that a locate marking device according to the embodiments described herein may include any suitable number of device health sensors for monitoring a desired number of device conditions.

According to one embodiment a record or message may be created based on operation of the device health sensor. For example a record or message may be created including a device ID e.g. of the locate marking device and the current state of certain device components such as input devices e.g. environmental and operational sensors . The record or message may also or alternatively include an identification of any resource utilization that is nearing a specified threshold e.g. memory nearing capacity . Thus it should be appreciated that various conditions may be monitored under the rubric of monitoring the health of the locate marking device and various actions taken in response to such monitoring.

The operational sensors may further comprise the image capture device . As previously mentioned the image capture device may be considered an operational sensor for example if and when configured to capture an image relating to the operation of the locate marking device .

Furthermore the operational sensors may comprise an audio recorder or acoustic sensor similar to or the same as audio recorder and therefore shown as audio recorder in . For example the locate marking device may include multiple audio recorders with one or more operating as an environmental sensor e.g. recording acoustic input from the environment and one or more operating as operational sensors e.g. recording acoustic input relating to operation of one or more components of the locate marking device . According to one embodiment a microphone associated with the audio recorder is positioned to detect sound emitted by a component of interest of the locate marking device. For example a microphone may be located near the marking dispenser to detect when marking material is dispensed. The audio input may also be stored by the audio recorder and processed in any suitable manner.

As previously described the audio recorder may be any suitable audio recorder including a digital audio recorder or analog audio recorder for example of any of the types previously described. In one embodiment the audio recorder may comprise a dedicated PIC processor. In those embodiments in which the locate marking device includes two or more audio recorders e.g. one operating an as environmental sensor and another operating as an operational sensor the audio recorders may share any suitable combination of circuitry. For example multiple audio recorders may share a same digital signal processor e.g. a dedicated audio signal processor . A separate microphone may be associated with each audio recorder or a microphone may be shared between two or more audio recorders. Thus it should be appreciated that the exact configuration and components of audio recorders according to the various embodiments described herein are not limiting.

The audio files produced by an audio recorder operating as an operational sensor may be stored locally in dedicated audio memory in local memory of control electronics in memory of the mobile device and or transmitted to an external device such as the remote computer .

In any of the embodiments illustrated in any one or more of the environmental sensors illustrated in and or operational sensors illustrated in may be operated in any suitable manner including continuously periodically and or in response to an event or trigger e.g. one or more actuations of the locate marking device or in any other suitable manner. For example one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may operate continuously during performance of a locate and or marking operation. In particular the ambient temperature sensor may output a substantially continuous data stream indicative of the sensed ambient temperature. Similarly the surface temperature sensor humidity sensor and light sensor may output substantially continuous data streams indicative of the respective sensed conditions. The inclinometer compass accelerometer yaw rate sensor proximity sensor pressure sensor and device health sensor may also output substantially continuous data streams indicative of the sensed operation. The image capture device may record a video sequence continuously during the locate and or marking operation and the audio recorder may continuously record any audio input during performance of the locate and or marking operation.

Alternatively one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be operated and or polled periodically with the resulting output data being logged and or transmitted periodically. For example the ambient temperature sensor may provide an output signal indicative of the sensed ambient temperature every second every five seconds every ten seconds every minute every ten minutes or at any other suitable time interval. Similarly the surface temperature sensor humidity sensor light sensor operational temperature sensor s inclinometer compass accelerometer s yaw rate sensor proximity sensor pressure sensor and device health sensor s may output data at periodic intervals. The image capture device may capture a still image or a video sequence of any desired duration at periodic intervals. The audio recorder may capture audio of any desired duration at periodic intervals. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may themselves operate so as to provide output information in an essentially continuous fashion but only be read or polled e.g. by processor or the processor of the mobile device on some discrete or periodic basis. Accordingly output signals or data provided by one or more sensors may be acquired logged into local memory and or transmitted to an external device in any of a variety of manners.

According to another embodiment one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may operate be read discretely and or be polled and therefore the corresponding data may be logged and or transmitted in response to actuation of the actuation system of the locate marking device. For example actuation of the actuation system may trigger collection of magnetic field data and simultaneously may trigger recording of a sensed ambient temperature from ambient temperature sensor . The remaining environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be operated read and or polled in a similar manner.

In one embodiment one or more of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be activated read discretely and or polled by the technician irrespective of whether the actuation system is actuated. For example the technician may activate read and or poll one or more of the environmental sensors by depressing a selection button corresponding to the environmental sensor s by choosing a selection button or menu option from a user interface of the locate marking device in those embodiments in which the locate marking device includes a user interface or from a user interface of the mobile device or in any other suitable manner. The operational sensors may operate similarly.

Thus it should be appreciated that the operation of sensors and reading and or logging and or transmitting of data from the environmental sensors and operational sensors is not limited to any particular manner or time but rather that various suitable schemes are contemplated. Also it should be appreciated that in those embodiments in which a locate marking device comprises multiple sensors the sensors need not operate in the same manner as each other. For example one or more of the sensors may operate periodically while one or more may only provide their data output in response to actuation of the locate marking device actuation system. In one embodiment a plurality of the sensors may provide their data outputs periodically but at different rates. As an example the accelerometers and yaw rate sensor of the locate marking device may output their data at relatively high frequencies such as in the kHz range MHz range or higher. The temperature sensors humidity sensor and light sensor may output their data at relatively lower frequencies such as approximately 1 Hz or sub Hz frequencies for example because those quantities may not change as rapidly as the quantities measured by the accelerometers and the yaw rate sensor. Other operating schemes are also possible.

According to one embodiment the output data from the sensors is only read and stored upon actuation of the actuation system even though the sensors may update their outputs at the above indicated frequencies or any other suitable frequencies. Upon such actuation data from any one or more of the sensors may be read out and stored in memory. The stored data may therefore represent the values present at the sensors at the time of actuation. In this manner data values output by the sensors when the trigger is not actuated may not be stored in some instances but rather may be updated by the subsequent data value from the sensor. In this manner only the most recent data from the sensors may be stored upon actuation. Other operating schemes are also possible.

Any data that is generated by any of the environmental or operational sensors or a portion thereof may be provided to a processor of the locate marking device or a processor of the mobile device in any suitable form and manner such that it is recognizable by the receiving processor. In some instances the data may be preprocessed e.g. preliminarily processed by an analog to digital converter filters a digital signal processor etc. prior to being handled by the processor or processor of the mobile device. In some implementations raw data from one or more sensors may be formed into packets e.g. by a microcontroller prior to transmission to processor or to mobile device . In some embodiments the processor may form received sensor data into packets for transmission to the mobile device or to a remote computer . Similarly the mobile device may form received sensor data into packets for transmission to the locate marking device or to the remote computer . As described herein data from any of the sensors may be obtained for processing on a periodic basis e.g. as a result of periodic polling of a sensor or on an aperiodic basis e.g. as a result of an intermittent actuation of a function of the locate marking device or intermittent polling by a user.

A non limiting example of a data packet that may be provided to a processor of the locate marking device or the mobile device or formed by either processor for subsequent transmission may comprise a header a flag field and a payload. Each of the header flag field and payload may comprise a fixed number of bits. Alternatively some of the data portions may have a fixed number of bits whereas other portions may be non fixed and include stop bits. The header may include for example any one of or a combination of identification information identifying a locate marking device or mobile device a sensor identification a job site or job identification number a marking technician a company or any other identification information of interest. Other information relevant to a locate and or marking operation may be included in the header. The header may additionally or alternatively include any required header information for conforming to a particular communication protocol implemented by the locate marking device or mobile device. The payload may include any one of or a combination of timing data acceleration data and GPS data among other things. In some implementations data packets may be parsed based on sensor type. For example accelerometer data packets are formed containing accelerometer data only in the payload. The flag field may be set by actuation of an actuator. Thus data packets generated during actuation of the actuator which may in at least some embodiments correspond to dispensing of marking material may be differentiated from data packets generated at other times during operation based on the status of the flag field which in some embodiments may be a single bit field with a value of 1 when the actuator is actuated and a value of 0 when the actuator is not though other forms of flag fields are also possible. In some embodiments storage and or processing of data packets may depend on the value s of the flag field. For example in one embodiment only data packets having the flag field set i.e. a value of 1 are stored locally and or transmitted from the locate marking device or mobile device . Other schemes are possible however. Furthermore other forms and contents of data packets are possible.

As mentioned previously environmental information and or operational information output by any one or more environmental sensors and operational sensors of the locate marking device or mobile device e.g. of the environmental sensors and or operational sensors may be used for one or more of various purposes some of which have been previously described. Examples of such purposes include assessing whether a locate and or marking operation was or is being performed within environmental and or operational tolerances interacting with the technician and or controlling altering operation of the locate marking device and augmenting data records files.

To this end the various environmental information and or operational information provided by various sensors may be organized and handled as data in various formats and in some implementations may be organized in terms of events and corresponding event entries formatted according to a particular protocol for example as discussed above in connection with Tables 2 5 and Tables 13 15. Event entries similar to these and including various environmental and or operational information may be generated by the locate marking device at some point once information has been read acquired from environmental and or operational sensors the event entries themselves or any information contained therein may be logged in a file for an electronic record and stored in memory of the locate marking device or mobile device and or the event entries themselves or any information contained therein may be transmitted by the locate marking device e.g. to remote computer .

In some implementations environmental information and or operational information may be contained within one or more event entries corresponding to an actuation of the locate marking device such that the environmental information and or the operational information is part of an actuation data set. Table 21 below illustrates a modification of an event entry originally depicted in Table 13 above in which environmental information and operational information is included as part of the data formatted in an actuation event entry according to one example. The information for acceleration may include three values for each axis of each accelerometer. One value for a particular axis may be a raw value the second value for a particular axis may be a high pass filtered value and the third value may be a low pass filtered value. Data values are only shown for one of the two accelerometers listed. Locate information from one or more input devices other components of the locate marking device is recorded with these events to provide information about the job in progress.

The contents of an information field for a particular piece of environmental information and or operational information in an event entry may have any of a number of forms for example the content may be strictly numeric e.g. according to some predetermined scale units of measure for the numeric information alphanumeric e.g. 78F text e.g. YES symbolic e.g. Y or N to indicate yes or no or some other symbol to provide an indication such as to indicate sensor failure or no sensor information available or referential in nature e.g. a filename pointer or other link to provide an indication of where relevant information relating to the particular environmental and or operational condition may be found .

In other implementations one or both of environmental information and or operational information may be formatted in one or more particular event entries generated specifically to provide such information in a manner that is not necessarily related to actuation of the locate marking device. For example such sensor read events may be generated as the result of the processor reading one or more environmental and or operational sensors one or more times while a job is in progress e.g. on a periodic basis pursuant to processor polls . Table 22 below provides an example of such a sensor read event entry.

With respect to file formats for electronic records including event entries or information derived therefrom as discussed above any number of file formats may be employed e.g. ASCII CSV XML .

The exemplary electronic record shown in may be used to evaluate performance of a locate and or marking operation for example by reviewing information in the actuation data set C the ticket information service related information the environmental information and or the operational information . It should be appreciated that the electronic record includes some information that assumes that the locate marking device includes the timing system and the location tracking system such as the timing and location information shown in the electronic record.

Table 23 provides an example of a data record that may be generated by a locate marking device communicatively coupled to a mobile device upon actuation of the actuation system. Each shown act corresponds to a separate actuation. As shown the data record may include information about the service provider identification the user technician identification the locate marking device identification the receiver mode a timestamp for example provided by a timing system such as timing system geo location data signal strength data gain of the locate marking device signal frequency data facility depth data facility type data ground type data locate request data and information relating to the environmental sensors . This example relates more particularly to a locate operation and is provided for purposes of illustration. The example is not limiting as many different forms of data records may be generated based on the operation of the locate marking device .

In a manner similar to Table 23 Table 24 provides another example of a data record that may be generated by locate marking device upon actuation of the actuation system. Each shown act corresponds to a separate actuation. As shown the data record may include information about the service provider identification the user technician identification the locate marking device identification the receiver mode a timestamp for example provided by a timing system such as timing system geo location data signal strength data gain of the locate marking device signal frequency data facility depth data facility type data ground type data locate request data and information relating to the operational sensors . The location tracking system provides the geo location data. The temperature sensor s provides the temperature data. The compass provides the heading. The inclinometer provides the inclination. The accelerometer s provides the acceleration and in this embodiment is a 3 axis accelerometer. The yaw rate sensor provides the yaw rate. The proximity sensor provides the distance which may represent the distance from the tip of the locate marking device to the ground in one non limiting embodiment. The pressure sensor provides the pressure measurement. This example is provided for purposes of illustration and is not limiting as many different forms of data records may be generated based on the operation of the locate marking device .

While Tables 23 and 24 respectively indicate the collection of environmental information and operational information separately and as part of an actuation data set it should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect. In particular both environmental information and operational information may be collected together as part of a given actuation data set. Furthermore the inclusion of one or both of environmental information and operational information in an electronic record such as the electronic record need not be limited to one or more particular actuation data sets rather in some exemplary implementations one or both of environmental information and operational information may be included as a unique component of an electronic record apart from any particular actuation data set e.g. one or both of environmental and operational information may be common to or shared by one or more actuation data sets .

As mentioned previously locate transmitters may also include environmental and or operational sensors to sense environmental and or operating conditions. Such information may be useful in assessing the general environmental conditions of a locate and or marking operation and the operating conditions of the locate transmitter among other things. An example and description of a locate transmitter that includes environmental and or operation sensors is described in co pending U.S. patent application entitled Locate Transmitter having Enhanced Features for Underground Facility Locate Operations and Associated Methods and Systems filed on Jun. 18 2010 and assigned Ser. No. 12 818 195 which is incorporated herein by reference.

As described above environmental information provided by environmental sensors and or operational information provided by operational sensors as well as any of the other constituent components of locate information marking information and landmark information discussed herein may be used to assess whether a locate marking device is being used and or whether a locate and or marking operation was or is being performed in accordance with recommended practices or within recommended environmental or operational conditions. As an illustrative example there may be certain preferred environmental conditions in which a locate marking device may be used and or in which a locate and or marking operation may be performed. Additionally there may be certain preferred process tolerances with respect to performing locate and or marking operations. For example there may be a minimum ambient light specification a certain angle specification with respect to the locate marking device relative to a target surface a certain distance specification i.e. distance from target surface a certain motion specification with respect to sweeping the locate marking device and the like. Violations of these process tolerances may result in poorly performed locate and or marking operations which may result in poor customer satisfaction and an increased risk of damage to facilities or danger to construction personnel. Other environmental and operational tolerances may also be applicable to locate and or marking operations and it should be appreciated that those listed above are non limiting examples provided for purposes of illustration.

In view of the foregoing according to another aspect of the present invention a locate marking device or a mobile device communicatively couple to a locate marking device may include an operations monitoring application that operates in combination with the locate marking device. The operations monitoring application may be installed on the locate marking device or on the mobile device. The operations monitoring application may provide for detecting and monitoring the use of locating equipment such as the locate marking devices described herein for out of tolerance environmental or operational conditions. For example the operations monitoring application may provide for detecting and monitoring the use of the locate marking device within the limits of its product specifications with respect to for example any combination of the ambient temperature humidity velocity and acceleration. Additionally or alternatively monitoring may be based on certain standard operating procedures e.g. as established by a facility owner a locate contractor a regulatory body etc. . Other bases for monitoring the operation of a locate marking device may also be used.

According to one aspect of this embodiment once an out of tolerance condition is detected either environmental or operational an out of tolerance alert or notification may be provided to the user technician of the locate marking device. In some exemplary implementations the out of tolerance alert may be generated by the control electronics of the locate marking device or by an application in operation on the mobile device in conjunction with electronics of the mobile device although not all implementations are limited in this respect. Additionally or alternatively a record of such out of tolerance alerts may be stored such as a record of alert acknowledgments that may be stored or transmitted by the locate marking device and or mobile device in response to the alert with or without technician acknowledgement. In some implementations where an alert may lead to an appreciable error in a locate and or marking operation operation of the locate marking device may be disabled until the alert condition is corrected.

Detailed descriptions of embodiments of an operations monitoring application and its uses can be found in co pending U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 703 958 entitled Marking Apparatus Having Enhanced Features for Underground Facility Marking Operations and Associated Methods and Systems filed Feb. 11 2010 and in co pending U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 704 087 entitled Locate Apparatus Having Enhanced Features for Underground Facility Locate Operations and Associated Methods and Systems filed on Feb. 11 2010 both of which are incorporated by reference. In various implementations the operations monitoring application as described in these references may be embodied as an application operable on a mobile device communicatively coupled to a locate marking device .

According to some embodiments it may be desirable to know the location of the tip of the locate marking device as for example the tip may be the portion of the locate marking device located in close proximity to the ground when a locate technician sweeps the locate marking device over the ground to detect a buried facility or moves the device over the ground to mark a buried facility. Determining the location of the tip of a locate marking device can be important for embodiments in which the operational sensors e.g. accelerometers and gyroscopes are only located in a mobile device affixed at or near the top of the locate marking device as depicted in . Thus for example determining the motion of the tip of the locate marking device may allow for assessment of technician manipulation of the locate marking device which may be used for quality control training purposes and standard setting among other things. Determining the location of the tip of the locate marking device may also allow for correcting the locate and or marking data to more accurately represent where facilities are located and where marks are dispensed.

Thus according to another aspect of the present invention methods and apparatus are provided for determining the location of the tip of a locate marking device. However it should be appreciated that the tip of the locate marking device is a non limiting example of a specific point of interest of a locate marking device for which it may be desirable to know the location as for example other portions of the locate marking device may be of interest in other embodiments. The methods and apparatus described herein may be applied equally well to the determination of any point of interest on the locate marking device.

One approach for determining the location of the tip of the locate marking device e.g. the portion near the marking material holder shown in or near detection electronics shown in or any other point of interest on the locate marking device is to place a location tracking system at that point. Thus according to one embodiment a locate marking device such as any of the locate marking devices described previously herein may include a location tracking system as discussed in other embodiments e.g. a GPS receiver wherein the location tracking system is disposed at or sufficiently near the tip of the locate marking device allowing for determination of the location of the tip of the locate marking device. Thus the location tracking system may provide the geo location of the tip of the locate marking device which as mentioned may be useful for a variety of reasons. For example the geo location information provided by the location tracking system may be used to record the motion of the tip of the locate marking device which may be used for detection of out of tolerance operation of the locate marking device determination of operating patterns of technicians or for various other purposes.

While the above described embodiment provides a location tracking system positioned at the point of interest on the locate marking device such positioning of a location tracking system may not always be possible or advantageous. For example as explained previously herein in some embodiments the operation of the location tracking system may be facilitated by positioning the location tracking system toward the top of the locate marking device for example if the location tracking system is a GPS receiver or a GPS tracking system included in mobile device . However as mentioned it may be desirable in some embodiments to determine the location of the tip of the locate marking device or any other point of interest of the locate marking device which in some situations will not correspond to the top of the locate marking device. Thus according to one embodiment methods and apparatus are provided for determining the location of a point of interest of a locate marking device when a location tracking system is located at a different point on the locate marking device. For simplicity of explanation the following examples will be discussed assuming that a location tracking system is located near the top of the locate marking device and that the point of interest of the locate marking device is the tip of the locate marking device. It should be appreciated that the described apparatus and techniques may apply equally well to other positions of the location tracking system and points of interest on the locate marking device.

To facilitate the following discussion it is useful to first consider the physical configuration at issue for determining the location of the tip of the locate marking device when the location tracking system is located at or near the top of the locate marking device. For this purpose the locate marking device may be represented in simplified form as an elongated rod or stick. illustrates a perspective view of such a simplified representation of a locate marking device shown as locate marking device .

In the x y plane represents the ground and the z direction represents the vertical direction perpendicular to the ground. The point P may be the location of a location tracking system e.g. a GPS receiver and in some embodiments may correspond generally to the top of the locate marking device for example near where the technician may hold the locate marking device if it is a handheld device. The point P represents the point of interest of the locate marking device and in this non limiting example corresponds generally to the tip of the locate marking device. The point P may be assumed to be at ground level i.e. in the x y plane z 0 for purposes of simplicity except as described below in those embodiments in which the distance of P from the x y plane may be measured. The shortest distance between P and P is given by L which in some embodiments may correspond to the length of the locate marking device although not all embodiments are limited in this respect. For example if the locate marking device has a non linear shape the distance L may not correspond to the length of the locate marking device. The locate marking device may be projected onto the x y plane z 0 along the dashed line which therefore lies in the x y plane. The distance between the points P and P in the x y plane i.e. along the dashed line is represented by d. The distance between the point P and ground is given by H i.e. z H . At any given time the locate marking device may make an angle with respect to the x y plane i.e. with respect to ground in this non limiting example. The projection of the locate marking device on the x y plane i.e. along the line may be at an angle in the x y plane with respect to the x axis. In some embodiments the x axis may be defined to align with true North although all embodiments are not limited in this respect.

According to one embodiment a locate marking device such as locate marking device may comprise a location tracking system at the point P. The location tracking system may provide the geo location of the point P with respect to the x y plane represented as GPS. The geo location of P in the x y plane may be represented by GPS . As will be explained GPS may be determined based on a value of GPSgiven by a location tracking system and determination of suitable combinations of L d H and . The value of L may be known before the locate operation begins for example since it may be set after manufacture of the locate marking device. The values of d H and may be directly sensed during operation of the locate marking device or may be calculated using suitable ones of the operational sensors as will be described below.

According to one embodiment the geo location of the tip of a locate marking device such as locate marking device may be determined using the value of GPSgiven by the location tracking system at P and accelerometer data from an accelerometer positioned at or sufficiently near the tip of the locate marking device i.e. at point P in . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. The accelerometer in this non limiting embodiment is a 3 axis accelerometer. By suitable analysis of the acceleration values for each axis using known algorithms the angle that the locate marking device makes with the ground may be determined see e.g. the previous discussion of how to use an accelerometer as an inclinometer as described by Shanghai Vigor Technology Development Co. . Based on the known distance L and the determined angle the distance d between GPSand GPS in the x y plane may be calculated using the fact that the cosine of is equal to d L .

Once the distance d is known the value of GPS may be derived from GPSif the angle is known since may provide the direction from GPSto GPS again in some embodiments the x axis may be aligned with or taken as true North such that may represent an angle with respect to true North . The value of may be determined in one of several manners. One manner for determining is from the readout of a compass of the locate marking device such as previously described compass . If the location tracking system providing GPSis a GPS receiver then the value of may alternatively be taken from the heading information provided as part of the NMEA data stream provided by the GPS receiver. A third alternative for determining is to calculate a direction of motion based on multiple GPS points taken from the location tracking system. According to this third alternative multiple GPS points taken at different times may be used to calculate a direction of motion by for example determining the direction indicated by a straight line connecting the multiple GPS points. Other methods for determining are also possible as these are non limiting examples. Once is known the value of GPS may then be determined from GPS d and . Once GPS is determined it may be used instead of GPS or in addition to GPS as more accurate geo location data which may be included for example in one or more event entries and or electronic records as discussed above.

According to an alternative embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing an inclinometer on the locate marking device such as inclinometer previously described. The inclinometer may provide the value of . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. Thus the value of d may be determined using L and as explained above. The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined from GPS d and as noted above.

According to another embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing a proximity sensor such as previously described proximity sensor . In this embodiment it is assumed that the value of L is known or determined in any suitable manner. The proximity sensor may be positioned at P and configured to measure the value of H. Assuming that the point P is at or very near the ground i.e. having a vertical height of approximately zero the value of H and the known distance L of the locate marking device may be used to determine d for example using the Pythagorean theorem. The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined using GPS d and .

As explained the above described example in which a single proximity sensor is used to determine the value of H may provide suitable results when it is assumed that the point P has zero vertical height. In one embodiment that assumption may be avoided by also including a proximity sensor at the point P and configured to measure the distance between P and the ground. Then the difference in height between P and P rather than the value of H may be used in connection with the known distance L to determine the distance d e.g. using the Pythagorean Theorem . The value of may be determined in any suitable manner for example using any of the techniques described above. The value of GPS may then be determined using GPS d and .

According to a further alternative embodiment the value of GPS may be determined from a measured value of GPSusing two 3 axis accelerometers on the locate marking device. One accelerometer may be located at the point P on the locate marking device while the second may be located at the point P. Using the techniques described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2008 0255795 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety the location of P relative to P may be determined.

As mentioned in some instances it may be desirable to track the motion of a specific portion of a locate marking device such as the tip of the locate marking device for any one of the reasons previously described. In those embodiments in which the locate marking device includes a location tracking system providing a value of GPSfor a different point on the locate marking device than the point of interest the tracking of the point of interest may be performed by determining GPS the location of the point of interest for each value of GPSas the locate marking device is moved using any of the above described techniques.

However in some instances the value of GPSprovided by the location tracking system may not have sufficient accuracy to allow for a desired level of accuracy in tracking the motion at the desired point on the locate marking device e.g. the point P . For example when performing a locate operation a technician may move the locate marking device by distances that are relatively small compared to the resolution of the location tracking system. For example when sweeping the locate marking device over the ground the sweeping pattern may include segments smaller than the resolution of the location tracking system e.g. smaller than approximately 30 inches in some embodiments . In such instances using the above described techniques for determining GPS as the point P moves may not sufficiently capture the movement with a desired resolution. Thus the techniques described below may be used.

According to one embodiment the motion of the point P may be tracked by using any of the above described techniques to get an initial value of GPS and then using data from an accelerometer at the point P to determine the distance traveled in the x and y directions. This technique is commonly referred to in the relevant arts as dead reckoning. In this embodiment the accelerometer may provide acceleration data for the x and y axes. That data may be integrated twice to determine the total distance traveled in the x and y directions thus giving the position of P at any point in time relative to any initial GPS value. Alternatively the accelerometer may output velocity data for each axis which may be integrated to determine the total distance traveled in the x and y directions. A specific example is now described with respect to .

The pattern of motion comprises lines . The solid lines in correspond to when the actuation system of the locate marking device e.g. actuation system is activated. Lines and described below are shown as dashed lines because the actuation system is not actuated as the locate marking device traversed the paths indicated by those lines.

The making of the pattern of motion by a locate marking device may be determined as follows. First the technician may begin the pattern at the point R at which time the technician actuates the actuation system e.g. to record magnetic field data . The location of point R may correspond to the initial location of the tip of the locate marking device and therefore may be determined from a value of GPSof the top of the locate marking device and any of the above described techniques for determining the location of the tip relative to the location of the top of the locate marking device.

The technician may then begin to move the locate marking device along the path indicated by line ending at the point R. The motion of the tip of the locate marking device along line may be determined from the output of an accelerometer at the tip of the locate marking device providing an output signal for both the x and y directions. According to one embodiment the output of the accelerometer is velocity data for both the x and y axes and is output periodically for example twice per second although higher and lower data output rates are possible. The velocity values for each of the x and y axes may be multiplied by the time duration between samples of the accelerometer e.g. one half of a second in this non limiting example to get the distance traveled in the x and y directions from the initial point R. Alternatively the total velocity of the locate marking device may be multiplied by the time duration between samples of the accelerometer and the direction of motion may be determined by comparing the velocity values for the x and y axes to each other e.g. by taking the ratio of the velocity along the x axis to the velocity along the y axis. Either way the distance traveled in the x and y directions may be determined.

In the non limiting example of the first line i.e. line may serve as a base line or reference line from which the angle of subsequent motions may be referenced. Thus in the angle of the second motion of the technician from points R to R along the path indicated by line may be determined by reference to the direction of line since the accelerometer output will indicate a change from the motion along the path of line . The distance and direction of the line may be determined as described above for line . Again the line is shown as a dashed line as the actuation system of the locate marking device is not activated while the locate marking device traverses the illustrated path.

The locate marking device is subsequently moved along line from point R to R then along line from point R to R then along line from point R to R along line from point R to R along line from point R to R and finally along line from point R back to point R . The length and relative direction of each of the indicated lines may be determined as described above for line

Thus it should be appreciated that according to this non limiting embodiment a value of GPSprovided by a location tracking system is used only to determine the initial location of R after which the locations of point R R are determined using dead reckoning.

Also it should be appreciated that while the relative orientation of each of the indicated lines is determined from the dead reckoning techniques described the absolute or actual orientation is not determined from the accelerometer data since the actual orientation of line is not determined from the accelerometer data. Thus according to one embodiment an additional step of determining an actual orientation of the line may be performed. According to one non limiting embodiment the actual orientation of line may be given by a heading provided by a compass of the locate marking device while the line is made. Other techniques may alternatively be used to determine the actual direction of the first motion of the pattern of motion.

According to the above described embodiment the location of the tip of a locate marking device may be determined by determining an initial location using a location tracking system and subsequently using the dead reckoning techniques described. Because the error associated with dead reckoning may increase as the distance traversed increases it may be desirable in some embodiments to reset the dead reckoning by determining a new initial location value using a location tracking system. For example referring to the pattern of motion in one embodiment the location of R may be determined from a value of GPSgiven by a location tracking system and any of the techniques described for determining a value of GPS for the given GPS. Subsequently dead reckoning may be used to determine the paths of lines and . According to one embodiment the location of point R is not determined from dead reckoning but rather may be determined by getting a value of GPSat the point R and calculating a corresponding value of GPS . Then dead reckoning may be used to determine the locations of lines . In this manner location errors that accumulate using dead reckoning may be minimized or eliminated.

Accordingly it should be understood that a new initial location point serving as a starting point for the use of dead reckoning may be set at any suitable intervals during a locate operation. Suitable criteria for determining when to set a new initial location point for the use of dead reckoning include setting a new initial point for the beginning of each new motion of a pattern that a technician makes e.g. each new sweeping segment of a sweeping pattern for each new pattern for each new locate job or every time the dead reckoning data indicates a threshold total distance has been traveled e.g. 5 meters 10 meters 50 meters or any other threshold value . This list is not exhaustive as other criteria may also be used to determine when to set a new initial location point for the use of dead reckoning.

In one illustrative embodiment a simple marking device or marking wand similar to the marking device of is coupled to a mobile phone. In one example of such an embodiment the mobile phone is an Android phone available from Motorola and various applications that could be adapted for use in conjunction with a marking operation are placed in operation on the phone some of the applications are available on line . The exemplary embodiment described below is provided primarily for instructive and illustrative purposes and is not intended to be limiting in any way of the various embodiments of the inventive locate marking device mobile device combination.

In this example implementation various types of operational and environmental data was recorded by the mobile phone during trial marking operations and simulated marking and or locate operations. The data was generated by environmental and operational sensors available on the phone. Data derived from the sensors was stored and later exported via a standard USB interface for subsequent analysis. The data was exported in comma separated value CSV file format.

The phone was mounted near the handle of the marking device and the device was used to mark both dots and dashes on a grassy area. Geo location data was recorded through a GPS tracking device available on the phone while the marks were dispensed. A microphone on the mobile phone was used to record acoustic emission arising from mechanical action of an actuator on the marking device as marks were dispensed. The acoustic emission occurs approximately at the initiation of dispensing marking paint and again at approximately the termination of dispensing the paint so that two acoustic signals bound an interval during which marking paint is dispensed by the marking device in this embodiment. An example of acoustic data exported from the mobile phone for subsequent analysis is shown below in Table 25. The data was exported in a comma separated value file format but may be exported in any suitable file format. For Table 25 the data has been truncated and reformatted for illustrative purposes only.

Data representative of the acoustic emission for the marking of dots and dashes is plotted in dots and dashes . The short intervals indicate that dots were dispensed whereas the long intervals indicate that dashes were dispensed by the marking device. The acoustic data recorded during a marking operation may be processed e.g. using a peak detection algorithm on data similar to that shown in to determine time intervals during which paint is dispensed from the marking device . Further the length of the dispensing interval may identify whether a tentative marking has been made dots or whether a final marking has been made dashes . The acoustic data may also be processed in conjunction with GPS data collected during the marking operation to determine approximately where the marks were made. The GPS data for the marking operation was also processed aligned with and plotted as an overlay on an aerial image of a grassy area in which marks were dispensed. The GPS data representative of the dots and dashes are shown as overlays in the images of dots and dashes .

Additional information can be collected during a marking operation from operational sensors and environmental sensors on the mobile device. In this example the mobile phone was equipped with 3 axis accelerometers a magnetic sensor and a temperature sensor. The yaw pitch and roll data were derived from the accelerometer and the magnetic sensor and were provided directly as an output of the phone i.e. exported for analysis . This data can be used to determine an orientation of the locate marking device with respect to a normal use orientation. An example of yaw pitch and roll data is shown in Table 26. Again the data has been truncated and reformatted for illustrative purposes only.

An example of yaw pitch and roll data generated and recorded by the mobile phone during a normal marking operation is plotted in . The data is representative of the mobile phone and marking device orientation. The data shows that the phone is pitched at about 30 degrees and exhibits minor variations in yaw and roll. shows similar data with a large spike occurring at about 8 seconds. This spike in the data was due to use of the marking device to fend off an attacking dog. The unusual motion of the marking device to which the mobile phone is coupled is clearly recorded by the operational sensors.

Data output from accelerometers on the mobile phone was also recorded and processed to determine the velocity of the marking device during marking operations. An example of acceleration data is shown below in Table 27. The data in Table 27 was truncated and reformatted for illustrative purposes only. The time values shown in the table are relative time values i.e. time measured from the start of a marking operation. However a local time value e.g. 15 03.012 may be used instead. The data was exported from the mobile phone in a comma separated value CSV data format but may be exported in any suitable format. In some implementations the data may be processed on the mobile phone and only velocity or position data along with time data exported.

The acceleration data may be processed to yield velocity or speed information e.g. via integration . Alternatively velocity or speed information may be provided by the GPS tracking device in the phone e.g. see Table 29 below . shows velocity data obtained from the phone s GPS tracking device for a first marking operation which was done too quickly at a running pace. shows velocity data for a normal marking operation. Velocity data can be used to determine whether a marking operation was carried out according to standard operating procedures.

Temperature data was also recorded with the mobile phone during a marking operation and is shown in . The fluctuations in temperature are believed to be due to discretization noise rounding to the nearest degree .

The mobile phone also included magnetic sensors which can provide compass functionality. Data from the magnetic sensors was also exported and an example of magnetic data is shown in Table 28. The magnetic data may be processed to provide bearing or heading information when the locate marking device is in motion. This data may be less reliable than other location and orientation data since local magnetic fields can be affected by the presence of certain metals e.g. heavy machinery.

The accuracy of the mobile phone s GPS tracking device was tested by walking with the marking device and attached mobile phone along a roadside curb while collecting GPS data. The GPS data was later processed aligned and overlaid on a geo referenced aerial image of the same area. The result is shown in . The plotted overlaid line follows the roadside curb within a few feet. The phone s GPS tracking device was also tested by walking underneath a structure e.g. into a building. The result is shown in and shows that the location tracking system of the mobile phone can perform acceptably well even underneath a structure including masonry and steel. For the plotted data of an electronic buffer region was included and displayed around the nominal data based at least in part on accuracy information provided by the GPS tracking device as an example of an accuracy or confidence zone that may be indicated electronically for an actual marking operation.

A mobile device may include software applications to process at least a portion of data from a plurality of sensors to provide composite location orientation and motion information. In another implementation the Android phone was adapted to provide location and motion information based on the phone s GPS location tracking capability. An example of data set of this location and tracking information was exported from the phone for analysis and is shown in Table 29. In Table 29 accuracy refers to an estimated accuracy of the GPS position.

Other applications operable on the mobile phone were implemented to demonstrate their potential use in conjunction with a marking operation. In a first application the mobile phone includes bar code reading functionality such that the type of marking material to be dispensed could be identified using image capture capability of the mobile phone s camera. For this embodiment the camera was used to image a barcode on a marking material can. The image was then submitted to a web based search engine via a mobile phone application such as Barcode Scanner available ZXing or Lynee Barcode Reader available from Lynkware S.A.S. through the Droid Market Place. The submitted barcode can be machine recognized and information about the product returned to the mobile phone for review and or data storage.

In a second application the mobile device includes a color detection system in which the color of marking material dispensed can be identified using an application such as What Color available from Jarcon in operation on the mobile phone. For this implementation the phone may be used to view a dispensed utility mark e.g. via the phone s camera . The color composition e.g. red R green G blue B values hue saturation etc. of a selected region of the image can be provided as data for output e.g. displayed transmitted to an external device or remote computer or stored in memory.

Although most data was exported from the mobile phone for subsequent analysis in the test apparatus as described above other approaches to data processing and recordation are considered to be equivalents and within the scope of the invention. For example custom software applications can be adapted to execute a portion most or all data processing on the mobile device. Results from data processing may be exported to a remote computer for further processing and or data storage. In some embodiments data accumulated from sensors on the mobile device and or on the locate marking device may be exported as raw data to a remote computer for processing or the data accumulated may be partially processed by the mobile device and or locate marking device and then stored or exported to a remote computer.

Computer executable instructions may be in many forms such as program modules executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally program modules include routines programs objects components data structures etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments.

Also data structures may be stored in computer readable media in any suitable form. For simplicity of illustration data structures may be shown to have fields that are related through location in the data structure. Such relationships may likewise be achieved by assigning storage for the fields with locations in a computer readable medium that conveys relationship between the fields. However any suitable mechanism may be used to establish a relationship between information in fields of a data structure including through the use of pointers tags or other mechanisms that establish relationship between data elements.

Also various inventive concepts may be embodied as one or more methods of which an example has been provided. The acts performed as part of the method may be ordered in any suitable way. Accordingly embodiments may be constructed in which acts are performed in an order different than illustrated which may include performing some acts simultaneously even though shown as sequential acts in illustrative embodiments.

All definitions as defined and used herein should be understood to control over dictionary definitions definitions in documents incorporated by reference and or ordinary meanings of the defined terms.

The indefinite articles a and an as used herein in the specification and in the claims unless clearly indicated to the contrary should be understood to mean at least one. 

The phrase and or as used herein in the specification and in the claims should be understood to mean either or both of the elements so conjoined i.e. elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with and or should be construed in the same fashion i.e. one or more of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the and or clause whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus as a non limiting example a reference to A and or B when used in conjunction with open ended language such as comprising can refer in one embodiment to A only optionally including elements other than B in another embodiment to B only optionally including elements other than A in yet another embodiment to both A and B optionally including other elements etc.

As used herein in the specification and in the claims or should be understood to have the same meaning as and or as defined above. For example when separating items in a list or or and or shall be interpreted as being inclusive i.e. the inclusion of at least one but also including more than one of a number or list of elements and optionally additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary such as only one of or exactly one of or when used in the claims consisting of will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general the term or as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives i.e. one or the other but not both when preceded by terms of exclusivity such as either one of only one of or exactly one of Consisting essentially of when used in the claims shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.

As used herein in the specification and in the claims the phrase at least one in reference to a list of one or more elements should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase at least one refers whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus as a non limiting example at least one of A and B or equivalently at least one of A or B or equivalently at least one of A and or B can refer in one embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one A with no B present and optionally including elements other than B in another embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one B with no A present and optionally including elements other than A in yet another embodiment to at least one optionally including more than one A and at least one optionally including more than one B and optionally including other elements etc.

In the claims as well as in the specification above all transitional phrases such as comprising including carrying having containing involving holding composed of and the like are to be understood to be open ended i.e. to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases consisting of and consisting essentially of shall be closed or semi closed transitional phrases respectively as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures Section 2111.03.
