This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 720 044 filed Mar. 9 2010 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 095 609 which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09 842 024 filed Apr. 26 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 703 611 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 236 351 filed Sep. 29 2000 all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference to their entireties.

The present invention relates generally to transferring electronic data in a communications system and more particularly to real time polling of users in a communications system.

Online service providers constantly are offering new services and upgrading existing services to enhance their subscribers online experience. Subscribers have on demand access to news weather financial sports and entertainment services as well as the ability to transmit electronic messages and to participate in online discussion groups. For example subscribers of online service providers such as America Online or CompuServe may view and retrieve information on a wide variety of topics from servers located throughout the world. A server may be maintained by the service provider or by a third party provider who makes information and services available through the worldwide network of computers that make up the online service.

To forecast the outcome of future events such as for example a political race pollsters randomly survey the voting population. Similarly providers routinely solicit customer feedback to assure that customers are satisfied with a particular product or service.

Presently some web pages allow a viewer to vote on a particular topic and to see a running tally of the results. In general the results obtained from such an online survey have little value because there are no measures in place to ensure accuracy.

In one general aspect data is transmitted to one or more users of a communications system by establishing a connection with one or more users designating targeting rules applicable to online users acquiring context information of online users applying the targeting rules to the context information to identify targeted online users and sending data to the targeted online users.

Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example the targeting rules may include parameters specifying a location of the online users. The location of the online users may be a geographic location and or an online location. The targeting rules also may include specified parameters. The parameters may specify a particular type of access device and or a particular type of software employed by the online users.

The context information of online users may include a token identifying a current location of an online user.

Online users may be ranked based on the specified parameters and applying the targeting rules to the context information may include identifying online users meeting the specified parameters.

The data sent to targeted users may be specific to a location of the targeted users. The location may be a geographic location and or an online location.

These and other general aspects may be implemented by an apparatus and or a computer program stored on a computer readable medium that may be a disk a client device a host device and or a propagated signal.

Examples of peripheral devices include but are not limited to a mouse a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a keyboard a display monitor with or without a touch screen input a TV remote control for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers and an audiovisual input device .

Although illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone a PDA and a TV remote control as being peripheral with respect to the general purpose computer in another implementation such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general purpose computer and operate as the client device . For example the mobile phone or the FDA may include computing and networking capabilities and function as a client device by accessing the delivery network and communicating with the host system .

In particular the client system and the communications link typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems and and communications links and of . Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems and shown in respectively.

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device .

The host device includes a login server for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system and other elements of the host device . The host device also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP Online Service Provide host complex and IM Instant Messaging host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers the client system includes communication software for example an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber s interactions with the respective services and in particular may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes.

Typically the OSP host complex supports different services such as email discussion groups chat news services and Internet access. The OSP host complex is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex to communicate with each other and employs certain protocols i.e. standards formats conventions rules and structures to transfer data. The OSP host complex ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common underlying proprietary protocol.

The IM host complex is generally independent of the OSP host complex and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber s network or Internet access. Thus the IM host complex allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex may support associated services such as administrative matters advertising directory services chat and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data the IM host complex employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.

The host device may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes such as the OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex with the IM host complex through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily when used to facilitate a link between complexes the OSP host complex gateway and the IM host complex gateway are privy to information regarding the protocol type anticipated by a destination complex which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance the OSP host complex and IM host complex generally use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway and or the IM host complex gateway .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link .

Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems and shown in respectively. However describes an aspect of the host system focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex . For purposes of communicating with an OSP host complex the delivery network is generally a telephone network.

The client system includes a client device and a client controller . The client controller is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system including the OSP host complex the LM host complex and or the Internet . In one implementation the client controller includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex using exclusive OSP protocols. The client controller also may include applications such as an IM client application and or an Internet browser application for communicating with the IM host complex and the Internet .

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host system includes a login server capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems to various elements of the host system including an OSP host complex and an IM host complex .

The OSP host complex and the IM host complex are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway and IM host complex gateway may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex the IM host complex and the Internet .

The OSP host complex supports a set of services from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex generally may be viewed as existing on the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example servers may be arranged in centralized or localized clusters in order to distribute servers and subscribers within the OSP host complex .

In the implementation of the OSP host complex includes a routing processor . In general the routing processor will examine an address field of a data request use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request and direct the data request to the appropriate destination. In a packet based implementation the client system may generate information requests convert the requests into data packets sequence the data packets perform error checking and other packet switching techniques and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system the routing processor may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . For example in the event that a data request from the client system can be satisfied locally the routing processor may direct the data request to a local server . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally the routing processor may direct the data request externally to the Internet or the IM host complex through the gateway .

The OSP host complex also includes a proxy server for directing data requests and or otherwise facilitating communication between the client system and the Internet . The proxy server may include an IP Internet Protocol tunnel for converting data from OSP protocol into standard Internet protocol and transmitting the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel also converts data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the converted data to the routing processor for delivery back to the client system .

The proxy server also may allow the client system to use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access the OSP host complex and the Internet . For example the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system to generate a request in standard Internet protocol such as HTTP HyperText Transport Protocol . In a packet based implementation data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol such as for example UDP User Datagram Protocol and routed to the proxy server . The proxy server may include a L2TP Layer Two Tunneling Protocol tunnel capable of establishing a point to point protocol PPP session with the client system .

The proxy server also may act as a buffer between the client system and the Internet and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example the proxy server can check parental controls settings of the client system and request and transmit content from the Internet according to the parental control settings. In addition the proxy server may include one or more caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches the proxy server may send the information to the client system from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .

Referring to a communications system is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system and a host system through a communication link . Client system typically includes one or more client devices and one or more client controllers for controlling the client devices . Host system typically includes one or more host devices and one or more host controllers for controlling the host devices . The communications link may include communication pathways enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown the client system may access the Internet through the host system .

Examples of each element within the communication system of are broadly described above with respect to . In particular the client system and the communications link typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to client systems and and communications links and of . Likewise the host system of may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems and shown in respectively. However describes an aspect of the host system focusing primarily on one particular implementation of IM host complex . For purposes of communicating with the IM host complex the delivery network is generally a telephone network.

The client system includes a client device and a client controller . The client controller is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system including the OSP host complex the IM host complex and or the Internet . In one implementation the client controller includes an IM application for communicating with servers in the IM host complex utilizing exclusive IM protocols. The client controller also may include applications such as an OSP client application and or an Internet browser application for communicating with the OSP host complex and the Internet respectively.

The host system includes a host device and a host controller . The host controller is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example in one implementation the host controller includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However in other implementations as described above the host controller may include any of several other programs machines and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .

The host system includes a login server capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems to various elements of the host system including an OSP host complex and an IM host complex . The login server may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex and the IM host complex are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway and IM host complex gateway may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex the IM host complex and the Internet .

To access the IM host complex to begin an instant messaging session the client system establishes a connection to the login server . The login server typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex the login server employs a hashing technique on the subscriber s screen name to identify a particular IM server for use during the subscriber s session. The login server provides the client system with the IP address of the particular IM server gives the client system an encrypted key i.e. a cookie and breaks the connection. The client system then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server through the communications link and obtains access to that IM server using the encrypted key. Typically the client system will be equipped with a Winsock API Application Programming Interface that enables the client system to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .

Once a connection to the IM server has been established the client system may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers may support associated services such as for example administrative matters directory services chat and interest groups. In general the purpose of the domain servers is to lighten the load placed on the IM server by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server and or the domain server a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers buddies are online exchange instant messages with particular subscribers participate in group chat rooms trade files such as pictures invitations or documents find other subscribers with similar interests get customized news and stock quotes and search the Web.

In the implementation of the IM server is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway facilitates the connection between the IM server and one or more alert multiplexors for example by serving as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers to several alert multiplexors. In general an alert multiplexor maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.

Once the client system is connected to the alert multiplexor a subscriber can register for and or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system and the alert multiplexor is determined by employing another hashing technique at the IM server to identify the particular alert multiplexor to be used for the subscriber s session. Once the particular multiplexor has been identified the IM server provides the client system with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor and gives the client system an encrypted key i.e. a cookie . The client system then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor through the communication link and obtains access to the alert multiplexor using the encrypted key.

The alert multiplexor is connected to an alert gate that like the IM host complex gateway is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to form a bridge to the OSP host complex . The alert gate is the interface between the IM host complex and the physical servers such as servers in the OSP host complex where state changes are occurring. In general the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However the alert multiplexor also may communicate with the OSP host complex through the IM gateway for example to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex with certain information gathered from the alert gate .

The alert gate can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate may include a piece of code alert receive code capable of interacting with another piece of code alert broadcast code on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general the alert receive code installed on the alert gate instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Upon detecting an alert feed the alert gate contacts the alert multiplexor which in turn informs the client system of the detected alert feed.

In the implementation of the IM host complex also includes a subscriber profile server connected to a database for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server may be used to enter retrieve edit manipulate or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation a subscriber s profile data includes for example the subscriber s buddy list alert preferences designated stocks identified interests and geographic location. The subscriber may enter edit and or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system to interact with the subscriber profile server .

Because the subscriber s data is stored in the IM host complex the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex using new or a different client system . Accordingly when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex the IM server can instruct the subscriber profile server to retrieve the subscriber s profile data from the database and to provide for example the subscriber s buddy list to the IM server and the subscriber s alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .

Similarly pod and includes a routing processor configured to directly or indirectly route data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex .

The pods and include local servers. The local servers alone or collectively are configured to provide services in a geographically localized manner to users associated with the particular pod. The OSP host complex also includes non podded servers. In the event that the data requests from a routing processor cannot be satisfied locally by the pod the routing processor directs the data request to these non podded servers.

In one implementation the local servers in pod are configured to function equivalently to the local servers in pod . In such an implementation the non podded server communicates with the pod and the pod in basically the same manner. In another implementation however the local servers in pod are configured to function differently than local servers in pod . In such an implementation the non podded server interacts with the pod and the pod in different ways. In an implementation where the non podded server is functioning differently with respect to pods and certain computing elements of the non podded server are configured to be multi functional. Alternatively different computing elements of the non podded server may be configured to perform distinct functions. A more complete understanding will be garnered from the communications methods described below.

Referring to a sender a recipient and a host interact according to a procedure to transmit electronic data. The procedure may be implemented by any type of hardware software device computer computer system equipment component program application code storage medium or propagated signal.

Initially the client establishes communication with the host step . In one implementation the client is a client system associated with an end user of the communications system and the host is an OSP host complex . Typically the client system provides authorizing information to a login server in order to obtain access to the OSP host complex . Once communication is established with the OSP host complex the client system may navigate to various areas within the OSP host complex to take advantage of the offered services.

The host designates targeting rules applicable to online users of the communications system step . In one implementation targeting rules include parameters specifying locations of online users. The location of an online user may be a geographic location and or an online location. The targeting rules also may include specified parameters. The parameters may specify a particular type of access device and or software employed by online users. The host may designate targeting rules before during or after communication with the client .

In one implementation the targeting rules include specified parameters and applying the targeting rules to the context information includes identifying online users meeting the specified parameters.

Once the host has identified targeted online users the host sends data to the client of one or more targeted online users step . In general the transmitted data is specific to a location of the targeted users. The location of the targeted users may be for example a geographic location and or an online location.

The client receives the data transmitted from the host step . Upon receipt of the data the client displays a message to the end user. The message may include for example timely information pertaining to the particular geographic and or online location of the end user.

The targeting server may perform such designation in response to user input and or commands from another server in the pod or the OSP host complex . The polling rules may include but are not limited to the polling issue or question the target audience or group and the time limit for answering.

The targeting server then sends one or more commands that reflect the designated polling rules to one or more instant voting servers step . Each instant voting server may be a podded server associated with a pod. It is understood however that each instant voting server may represent a network of interconnected instant voting servers associated with a pod.

The instant voting server receives the commands reflecting the polling rules from the targeting server step . The instant voting server then sends a query to a routing processor requesting user context information step . In general the instant voting server is concerned only with context information of users within the pod.

The routing processor receives the query requesting user context information from the instant voting server step . In one implementation the routing processor acquires user context information for all users on the pod in response to the query step . Alternatively the routing processor may continuously maintain context information for all users on the pod.

The routing processor sends the user context information to the instant voting server step . The instant voting server receives the user context information from the routing processor step . Then the instant voting server applies the polling rules against the user context information to identify targeted online users step . In one implementation the online users are sorted and or ranked based on parameters established by the polling rules. Such parameters may include for example geographic location and or online location.

The instant voting server sends a polling request to the client of a targeted online user step . In one implementation the polling request includes an electronic ballot and an elapsing time limit for completing the electronic ballot. The elapsing time limit may be common to all targeted online users. The elapsing time limit may be a relatively short time interval such as for example less than two minutes. The elapsing time limit may begin when the electronic ballot is initially displayed to the online users and may expire after a fixed time interval.

The client of the targeted online user displays the polling request step . The targeted online user completes the electronic ballot prior to the expiration of the time limit. The client then transmits a response to the polling request to the instant voting server step .

The instant voting server receives the response to the polling request from the client step . The instant voting server then aggregates all received responses to the polling requests step . In general the instant voting server aggregates responses from targeted online users of a particular pod.

The instant voting server then sends the aggregate value of the responses to the targeting server step . The targeting server receives the aggregate value of responses from the instant voting server step . In general the targeting server will receive an aggregate value of responses from each instant voting server representing each pod in the OSP host complex . The targeting server then tallies the responses step .

After a result of the polling has been reached the targeting server may store the result or may cause the result to be displayed on the client of a targeted online user. In one implementation the host displays particular content to the online users based on result of the tallying. Particular content may include but is not limited to a graphical user interface and or multimedia data.

Referring to the client and the host also may interact according to a procedure to transmit electronic data. The procedure may be implemented by any type of hardware software device computer computer system equipment component program application code storage medium or propagated signal.

The targeting server designates targeting rules step . The targeting server then sends commands reflecting the targeting rules to the instant notification server step .

The instant notification server receives the commands reflecting the targeting rules from the targeting server step . The instant notification server then sends a query to the routing processor requesting user context information step .

The routing processor receives the query requesting the user context information from the instant notification server step . The routing processor then acquires the user context information step . Alternatively the routing processor continuously maintains user context information for all online users.

The routing processor sends the user context information to the instant notification server step . The instant notification server receives the user context information from the routing processor step . The instant notification server applies the targeting rules against the user context information to identify targeted online users step .

The instant notification server then sends a notification message to a client of a targeted online user step . The client then displays the notification message to the targeted user of step .

Referring to a user interface UI illustrates an example of how a polling request is displayed to a targeted online user. The UI includes a browser window rendering an electronic ballot . The electronic ballot includes a polling issue or question an elapsing voting time limit box and selectable answers for voting the electronic ballot .

Referring to a UI illustrates an example of how a notification message is displayed to a targeted online user. The UI includes a browser window rendering a notification message . In this example the notification message includes timely weather information. In general the notification message is specific to a location of the targeted online users. As shown in the location of the targeted online users is Washington D.C.

Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims. For example the general aspects described above relate to instant messaging and e mail as well as other forms of communication such as for example telephonic communication.
