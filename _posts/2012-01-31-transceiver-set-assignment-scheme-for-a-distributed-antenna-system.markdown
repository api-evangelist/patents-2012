The present disclosure relates generally to methods and apparatuses for a transceiver set assignment scheme for a distributed antenna system.

Distributed antenna systems include a base station also known as a Radio Element Control or a Baseband Unit and one or more remote transceivers also known as Radio Elements or Remote Radio Heads . These components provide endpoints with wireless network access. Within a distributed antenna system the remote transceivers are distributed among different locations while being connected via a wired connection e.g. optical fiber to the base station. Each remote transceiver or a subset thereof transmits essentially the same core data and the endpoint combines multiple signals from multiple remote transceivers into a single communication. The base station may communicate with the remote transceivers to facilitate transmissions between the base station and the endpoint. For example the remote transceivers may relay control information and or data between the base station and one or more endpoints.

A distributed antenna system may implement downlink coordinated multi point processing DL CoMP . DL CoMP is a special type of multiple input and multiple output MIMO transmission where multiple transmitting antennas are placed at different locations either on a base station or a remote transceiver while the receiving antennas are located on the endpoint. Transmissions from multiple physical antenna ports at different locations either from different base stations or from different remote transceivers to the same endpoint using the same physical resource blocks PRBs are coordinated by the transmitting base station s and or remote transceiver s .

Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a transceiver set assignment scheme for a distributed antenna system. For example in one embodiment a method includes establishing a plurality of wired connections between a base station and a plurality of geographically distributed remote transceivers. Each remote transceiver of the plurality of remote transceivers has one or more physical antenna ports. The plurality of remote transceivers are assigned to a plurality of sets where each set has one or more of the plurality of remote transceivers. One or more logical ports is assigned to each set of the plurality of sets. Each logical port of a set corresponds to at least one physical antenna port of the one or more remote transceivers of the respective set. Data traffic is sent from the base station to the endpoint using at least one wireless connection between the endpoint and at least one physical antenna port of the one or more remote transceivers of a first set of the plurality of sets.

Embodiments and their advantages are best understood by referring to of the drawings like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.

Distributed antenna system provides wireless coverage for any suitable number of endpoints over a geographic area such as cell . For example a single base station e.g. base station and a plurality of remote transceivers e.g. remote transceivers may be used to provide wireless coverage for an entire building a city block a campus or any other area. Cell may have any suitable shape such as the honeycomb like shape depicted in . Cells that are adjacent to cell may include other antenna systems configured to provide service for endpoints located within the boundaries of these neighboring cells. Cell may be identified by a cell identifier that is assigned to the transceivers i.e. base station and remote transceivers located within the boundaries of cell . The cell identifier may include one or more numbers letters other identifiers or combination thereof. The cell identifier may be included in at least a subset of transmissions from base station and or remote transceivers to endpoint .

Base station may include any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for wired or wireless exchange of packets in distributed antenna system . Base station may be coupled to remote transceivers via wired connections . Wired connections may comprise any suitable material such as optical fiber. Base station may use any suitable wired technologies or protocols e.g. Common Public Radio Interface CPRI to communicate with remote transceivers through wired connections .

Base station may communicate with endpoint via wireless communication through antennas and and or through one or more antennas of one or more remote transceivers . For example base station may send data destined for an endpoint through wired connection to one or more remote transceivers . The remote transceivers then send the data to endpoint via one or more wireless connections between one or more physical antenna ports of the remote transceivers and one or more physical antenna ports of endpoint . As another example data from endpoint may be received through one or more wireless connections between endpoint and one or more physical antenna ports of one or more remote transceivers . This data is then relayed to base station by the remote transceivers through one or more wired connections . Base station may communicate with endpoint using any of a variety of different wireless technologies including but not limited to orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA and the long term evolution advanced LTE A protocol as defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Release 10 or beyond.

Although not shown in the embodiment depicted base station may also be coupled to any network or combination of networks capable of transmitting signals data and or messages including signals data or messages transmitted through WebPages e mail text chat voice over IP VoIP and instant messaging in order to provide services and data to endpoints . For example base station may be coupled to one or more LANs WANs MANs PSTNs WiMAX networks global distributed networks such as the Internet Intranet Extranet or any other form of wireless or wired networking. In particular embodiments base station also communicates with a base station controller that facilitates handoffs between cells and provides other functions.

A remote transceiver may include any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware to implement any number of communication protocols that allow for the wireless exchange of packets with endpoints in distributed antenna system . Remote transceiver may communicate with endpoint using any of a variety of different wireless technologies including but not limited to OFDMA and the LTE A protocol. Remote transceivers are operable to send control signals and data traffic to endpoints . In certain situations a remote transceiver may function as an extension of base station . For example the remote transceiver may send wireless signals to endpoint that are similar to wireless signals that would be sent by base station if endpoint were located close to base station

Endpoint may comprise any type of wireless device able to send and receive data and or signals to and from base station directly and or via remote transceivers . Some examples of endpoints include desktop computers PDAs cell phones laptops and or VoIP phones. Endpoints may provide data or network services to a user through any combination of hardware software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware . Endpoints may also include unattended or automated systems gateways other intermediate components or other devices that may send or receive data and or signals.

Base station and remote transceivers may utilize any suitable communication scheme to communicate with endpoint . For example a MIMO scheme may be used that utilizes multiple physical antenna ports to communicate a data stream to endpoint . In particular embodiments a DL CoMP scheme is used wherein multiple physical antenna ports that are located at different sites e.g. different remote transceivers or base station are used to communicate with endpoint are located at different sites. Endpoint may combine multiple signals from multiple remote transceivers and or base station into a single communication.

Various types of information may be sent to or from endpoint . In particular embodiments base station generates control messages for the entire cell and transmits these control messages to remote transceivers . These control messages may be jointly transmitted by each physical antenna port of distributed antenna system . The control messages may include information e.g. scheduling or demodulation information that allows endpoint to extract relevant data traffic from transmissions sent from base station . In particular embodiments these control messages conform to the LTE A standard. For example the control messages may include cell specific reference signals CRS such as primary synchronization signal PSS secondary synchronization signal SSS physical broadcast channel PBCH and or physical downlink control channel PDCCH reference signals.

Various other signals may be transmitted by physical antenna ports . For example each physical antenna port may transmit a channel reference signal such as a channel state information reference signal CSI RS as defined in LTE A. The channel reference signal may include a sequence of values such as a pseudo random sequence. Endpoint receives channel reference signals from various physical antenna ports and provides signal quality feedback to base station based on the quality e.g. strength of the received channel reference signals. The signal quality feedback may be used by base station to select the set of transceivers that is used to communicate with endpoint .

As depicted transceivers and may be arranged into sets . For example set includes base station set includes remote transceivers and set includes remote transceivers and and set includes remote transceivers and . Each set may include any suitable number of transceivers and or base station . After the transceivers are assigned to sets one or more logical ports are assigned to each set . A logical port of a set corresponds to one or more physical antenna ports of the transceiver s assigned to that set. The physical antenna ports of a set may each transmit a channel reference signal e.g. CSI RS that is based on a common sequence. The sequence and occupied resources e.g. time frequency or code used by the set may be substantially the same or similar to the sequence and occupied resources used by the CSI RS port described in 3GPP Release 10. However at least one of the occupied resources used by a set to transmit its channel reference signal is orthogonal in the time frequency or code domain or any combination thereof to the resources used by the other sets to transmit their respective channel reference signals. This allows channel reference signals from different sets to be distinguished by endpoint .

Each physical antenna port of a logical port may transmit the same channel reference signal e.g. a signal with the same sequence . In particular embodiments a channel reference signal is produced by applying a precoding matrix to the common sequence upon which each channel reference signal for the set is based. The precoding matrix used by the physical antenna ports of a logical port may be fixed i.e. each physical antenna port of a particular logical port uses the same precoding matrix . Other logical ports of the same set may use the same precoding matrix or a different precoding matrix. If different precoding matrices are used by logical ports of a set the precoding matrices may have the same Frobenius norm.

Each logical port of a set may correspond to one or more physical antenna ports that have substantially the same geometric distributions as the one or more physical antenna ports of the other logical port s of the set. That is if a logical port of a set corresponds to one or more physical antenna ports at one or more particular locations e.g. remote transceiver then each other logical port of the set also corresponds to one or more different physical antenna ports at the same one or more locations. Thus the number of logical ports in a particular set may be equal to the number of physical antenna ports at the transceiver of the set that has the smallest number of physical antenna ports since each of these physical antenna ports is included in a logical port of the set .

When the physical antenna ports of logical ports of a set have substantially the same geometric distribution and the channel reference signals of the logical ports of a set are based on substantially the same sequence the strength of a signal received at an endpoint at any location within cell from the physical antenna ports of a logical port of a set will be substantially the same as the received signals from the physical antenna ports of the other logical ports of the set. This may facilitate reuse of the existing MIMO codebook set forth in 3GPP Release 10 in the methods and systems described herein.

The configuration of the channel reference signals e.g. the CSI RS configuration may be different for different sets in the same cell . A configuration for a set may specify the number of logical ports e.g. CSI RS ports one or more modulation sequences resource mapping period of transmission subframe offset other suitable information or combination thereof. The configurations may be advertised in any suitable manner such as through control messages associated with the PBCH.

Each set shown in includes logical ports having substantially the same geometric distribution of physical antenna ports as the other logical port of the set . For example both the first and second logical ports of set correspond to a physical antenna port at remote transceiver and a physical antenna port at remote transceiver . Accordingly when endpoint receives a channel reference signal from the physical antenna ports of the first logical port of set it will have substantially the same strength as a channel reference signal received from the physical antenna ports of the second logical port of set

In particular embodiments when a logical port corresponds to multiple physical antenna ports transmitting substantially the same channel reference signal one or more of the physical antenna ports transmits the channel reference signal with a phase shift. The phase shift may be determined by a beam steering vector that may be tuned to optimize the coverage of the sets . In general such tuning takes advantage of interference to change the directionality of one or more physical antenna ports .

Endpoint of is configured to receive the channel reference signals transmitted by the physical antenna ports of sets . For a particular set the channel experienced by endpoint is the sum of the channel responses from each of the physical antenna ports of the set . For each set endpoint may combine the channel reference signals received from the physical antenna ports of the set into a single signal. In fact in certain situations endpoint may be unable to distinguish between a channel reference signal sent by a particular physical antenna port of a set and another physical antenna port of the set .

Because sets are distributed over the geographical area of cell the strength of the channel reference signals received at endpoint from various sets may be different. In general the channel reference signal from a set that includes physical antenna ports that are closer to the endpoint will be stronger than the channel reference signal from a set that includes physical antenna ports that are further from endpoint .

Endpoint calculates signal quality feedback for each set based on the quality and or strength of the channel reference signal received from the respective set . In particular embodiments the signal quality feedback calculated for a set may include one or more of a channel quality indicator CQI a precoding matrix indicator PMI or a rank indication RI as defined in 3GPP Release 10. After calculating the signal quality feedback endpoint reports the signal quality feedback to base station . In particular embodiments endpoint reports the signal quality feedback for each set . In other embodiments endpoint reports signal quality feedback for a subset of sets . For example endpoint may report signal quality feedback for a set with the strongest channel reference signal e.g. the set with the highest measured CQI and the signal quality feedback for a set with the second strongest channel reference signal.

Base station may be operable to instruct endpoint regarding which sets to measure and or provide signal quality feedback for. For example base station may instruct endpoint to provide signal quality feedback for the sets with the strongest channel reference signals. As another example base station may instruct endpoint to measure and provide signal quality feedback only for particular sets such as sets and

After receiving the signal quality feedback from endpoint base station makes one or more determinations based on the received signal quality feedback. For example base station may determine that a particular set should be used to communicate with endpoint and consequently associate the set with the endpoint . As an example base station may determine that the set that has the best signal quality feedback e.g. strongest channel reference signal from endpoint will be used to communicate data traffic to endpoint . In particular embodiments base station receives signal quality feedback from multiple endpoints and associates each endpoint with a set in order to achieve system optimality. For example a particular endpoint could be associated with the set for which it measured a second best signal quality feedback if the set for which it measured the best signal quality feedback is better suited for a different endpoint . Multiple endpoints may be assigned to the same set if time division multiple access TDMA or frequency division multiple access or FDMA is utilized.

As another example of a determination based on the received signal quality feedback base station may determine a location of endpoint . The location determined could be a relative location. For example the determined location of endpoint may indicate that endpoint is closer to a particular remote transceiver than it is to a different remote transceiver or base station

As yet another example of a determination based on the received signal quality feedback base station may determine that endpoint should measure and or provide feedback for particular sets . In some embodiments the particular sets are chosen based on the determined location of endpoint . For example base station may determine that endpoint should measure and or provide feedback for the three or other suitable number of sets that are nearest endpoint . Base station then communicates this determination to the relevant endpoint and the endpoint measures and or provides signal quality feedback for the specified sets.

After base station has selected a set for communication with endpoint base station may communicate data traffic to endpoint through the physical antenna ports of the selected set . This may involve sending data traffic from the base station to the endpoint using at least one wireless connection between the endpoint and at least one physical antenna port of the selected set. That is base station may send the data traffic through a physical antenna port of base station if base station is assigned to the selected set and or may send the data traffic through a wired connection to one or more remote transceivers of the selected set and instruct the remote transceivers to transmit the data traffic through the relevant physical antenna port s .

Data traffic may be distinguished from control traffic that is used to setup and maintain a connection between base station and endpoint . For example and not by way of limitation data traffic may include information that base station receives from a network coupled to the base station such as the Internet or from another endpoint located in the same cell or a different cell. In a particular embodiment data traffic is sent to endpoint via a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH as defined in the LTE A protocol. In such embodiments demodulation reference signals DM RS as defined in the LTE A protocol may be sent from the physical antenna ports of the selected set and used to extract the relevant data traffic from the PDSCH.

In sets that include a plurality of physical antenna ports data traffic may be sent from base station to endpoint using a multiple input multiple output MIMO scheme. For example two logical ports of a set could each transmit via the one or more physical antenna ports that each port corresponds to a portion of a parallel data stream to endpoint . With the assignment depicted in up to four endpoints may be served in the same resource blocks RB if multi user MIMO MU MIMO is used.

Although illustrates a particular number and configuration of endpoints connections links and nodes distributed antenna system contemplates any number or arrangement of such components for communicating data. In addition elements of distributed antenna system may include components centrally located local with respect to one another or distributed throughout distributed antenna system .

The assignment shown in may allow more endpoints to be serviced within cell than the assignment shown in because of the increased number of sets . For example with the assignment depicted in up to seven endpoints may be served in the same RB if MU MIMO is used by distributed antenna system . However this assignment also results in increased administrative overhead in sending reference signals and receiving and processing feedback from endpoints . In some situations the administrative overhead may be reduced by having one or more endpoints only report signal quality feedback for a subset of sets . The assignment shown in also provides less throughput per endpoint as compared to the assignment of since less physical antenna ports are included in each set that communicates with an endpoint .

The assignment of the transceivers into sets may be changed at any suitable time by base station . Upon determining that a change is to be made base station will notify remote transceivers of such a change. For example base station may notify a remote transceiver that it should use a different frequency time or code to send out channel reference signals from its physical antenna ports if the remote transceiver has been put into a different set so as not to conflict with transmissions from the other sets . In particular embodiments a PBCH update from base station implements a change in the configuration of sets .

Such an approach for assigning transceivers to sets sending reference signals through the physical antenna ports of the sets and receiving feedback regarding the reference signals provides various advantages. For example the coverage range and reliability of CRS and PDCCH may be increased due to joint and coherent transmission through all the physical antenna ports located in cell . As another example the signal strengths received at endpoint from multiple physical antenna ports using the same RBs to communicate with endpoint are similar i.e. there is no path loss imbalance . This simplifies reuse of the MIMO scheme described in 3GPP Release 10. The dynamic adjustability of the sets allows base station to configure distributed antenna system to provide particular performance characteristics. For example distributed antenna system may be configured to support more endpoints or to provide higher throughput to endpoints . Base station may also tune one or more beam steering vectors of one or more physical antenna ports to optimize the coverage of one or more of the sets of distributed antenna system . Base station may also select sets that are optimal for communication with particular endpoints .

Base station may have any one or more of the characteristics and may perform any one or more of the functions described above in connection with base station . Remote transceivers may have any one or more of the characteristics and may perform any one or more of the functions described above in connection with remote transceivers . In particular embodiments remote transceivers are high power transceivers with physical antenna ports having transmission ranges long enough to cover at least a substantial portion of an entire cell . Base station may be coupled to remote transceivers via wired connections . Base station may use any suitable wired technologies or protocols e.g. CPRI to communicate with remote transceivers through wired connections . Although not shown remote transceivers may each be coupled to one or more networks such as the Internet or one or more PSTNs operable to provide network services and data to endpoints .

The transceivers may be assigned to one or more sets in a manner similar to that described above in connection with . As described above each set includes one or more logical ports that each correspond to one or more physical antenna ports of the transceiver s of the set. In the example depicted in two sets associated with cell are shown. The first set includes two logical ports. The first logical port includes physical antenna port and the second logical port includes physical antenna port . The second set associated with cell is set . Set includes two logical ports as well. The first logical port includes physical antenna port of base station and physical antenna port of remote transceiver . The second logical port includes physical antenna port of base station and physical antenna port of remote transceiver

In particular embodiments each set is associated with a cell identifier. A set that includes transceivers from different cells may be associated with the cell identifier of either cell. For example in the embodiment depicted set includes transceivers from cell base station and cell remote transceiver . In the example that will be discussed in connection with the depicted embodiment set is associated with the cell identifier for cell . However an additional set that includes the same transceivers base station and remote transceiver could be associated with the cell identifier for cell

Although not shown base station and or remote transceivers could be assigned to additional sets . For example base station and remote transceiver could be assigned to an additional set. Base station could be paired with each of remote transceivers and in a similar manner to form four additional sets. As another example two or more remote transceivers could be grouped together to form an additional set. As in the assignment scheme described above in connection with each logical port of a particular set may correspond to one or more physical antenna ports that have substantially the same geometric distribution as the physical antenna ports of the other logical port s of the set.

After sets are formed the physical antenna ports of each set transmit a channel reference signal. If multiple sets are associated with the same cell identifier then the channel reference signals transmitted within each set should be orthogonal in time frequency or code OCC domain or any combination thereof such that the channel reference signals sent by the respective sets may be distinguished by endpoint . If a set is associated with a cell identifier that is different from a cell identifier associated with a different set the two sets may share substantially similar sequences and resources to transmit their respective channel reference signals if the channel reference signals are signaled differently e.g. the channel reference signals may be distinguished with different configurations as described above .

For example the physical antenna ports of set i.e. physical antenna ports and may transmit a first channel reference signal that is received and measured by endpoint . A second channel reference signal using different resources e.g. orthogonal in time frequency code domain or a combination thereof to the resources used to transmit the first channel reference signal is transmitted by the physical antenna ports of set i.e. physical antenna ports and . In certain embodiments endpoint is not aware that the second channel reference signal is transmitted from transceivers located in two different cells because the transmissions are associated with the same cell identifier.

As described above when a logical port corresponds to multiple physical antenna ports transmitting the same channel reference signal one or more of the physical antenna ports may transmit the channel reference signal with a phase shift. The phase shift may be determined by a beam steering vector that may be tuned to optimize the coverage of the sets .

Endpoint may be associated with a primary cell . For example in the embodiment depicted the primary cell associated with endpoint is cell . In general the primary cell associated with endpoint remains the same until endpoint is handed over to a new primary cell. In certain embodiments an endpoint associated with a primary cell is configured to measure and provide feedback for channel reference signals sent from sets associated with the cell identifier of the primary cell and to ignore channel reference signals sent from sets that are not associated with the cell identifier of the primary cell.

In particular embodiments the transceiver of the primary cell sends certain control messages e.g. CRS to endpoint and the transceivers of the other cells do not need to send such messages. Information included in theses control messages e.g. CRS may be used by endpoint to decode other control messages such as control messages included in the PDCCH. In particular embodiments endpoint also receives the PDCCH from the primary cell

After receiving the signal quality feedback from endpoint base station makes one or more determinations based on the received signal quality feedback. For example base station may determine that a particular set should be used to communicate with endpoint and may consequently associate the set with the endpoint .

In particular embodiments base station selects a set that includes transceivers located in different cells such as set only if the strength of the channel reference signal from that set exceeds the strength of a channel reference signal from a set that only includes base station such as set by a predetermined amount. For example even if the CQI indicated in signal quality feedback associated with set is higher than the CQI indicated in signal quality feedback associated with set base station may decide to use set to communicate until the CQI associated with set is higher than the CQI associated with set by a predetermined amount. Such embodiments may be implemented due to the increased overhead associated with communicating with an endpoint through transceivers located in multiple cells .

Base station may also determine a location of endpoint based on the signal quality feedback. The location determined may be a relative location. For example the determined location of endpoint may indicate that endpoint is closer to a particular remote transceiver than it is to base station . If base station determines that endpoint is close to the boundary between cells and it may identify cell as a candidate for handover.

Base station may also determine that endpoint should measure and or provide feedback for a subset of sets associated with the cell identifier of the primary cell . In some embodiments the particular sets are chosen based on the determined location of endpoint . For example for the location of endpoint shown in the embodiment depicted base station could determine that endpoint should measure and or provide feedback for set and set and ignore channel reference signals from other sets having the same cell identifier . Base station then communicates this determination to the relevant endpoint and the endpoint measures and or provides signal quality feedback for the specified sets.

After base station has selected a set for communication with endpoint base station may communicate data traffic to endpoint through the physical antenna ports of the selected set . For example if set is selected base station may communicate with endpoint using traditional MIMO as described in 3GPP Release 10. As another example if set is selected base station and remote transceiver may communicate with endpoint using CoMP Joint Processing CoMP JP . In particular embodiments data may be communicated using a PDSCH. If the PDSCH is sent via multiple logical ports of a set the DM RS used to extract data traffic from the PDSCH may be different for each logical port but may be based on the same DM RS precoder matrix associated with set .

If endpoint is subsequently handed over to a different primary cell such as cell various control messages e.g. via a PDCCH may be sent to endpoint by remote transceiver . For example remote transceiver may instruct endpoint to begin measuring and providing signal quality feedback for sets associated with the cell identifier of cell

Such an approach for assigning transceivers to sets that may include transceivers located in distinct cells may provide various advantages. For example a transceiver in a neighboring cell may be used to communicate with an endpoint without having to initiate a handover to the neighboring cell. As another example path loss imbalance may be reduced or eliminated when joint processing is performed from different remote transceivers . This may simplify reuse of the MIMO scheme disclosed in 3GPP Release 10. As another example signal quality feedback based on joint transmissions from multiple remote transceivers in distinct cells may be more accurate than reporting signal quality feedback for the two sets separately and having base station combine the two measurements. Flexible scheduling using multiple sets may also be done dynamically based on endpoint locations. For example scheduling of different transmission modes single site MIMO or CoMP JP may be done using a PDCCH.

The components of base station remote transceiver and endpoint may comprise any suitable physical form configuration number type and or layout. As an example and not by way of limitation base station remote transceiver and or endpoint may comprise an embedded computer system a system on chip SOC a single board computer system SBC such as for example a computer on module COM or system on module SOM a desktop computer system a laptop or notebook computer system an interactive kiosk a mainframe a mesh of computer systems a mobile telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a server or a combination of two or more of these. Where appropriate base station remote transceiver and or endpoint may include one or more computer systems be unitary or distributed span multiple locations span multiple machines or reside in a cloud which may include one or more cloud components in one or more networks.

In the depicted embodiment base station remote transceiver and endpoint each include their own respective processors and memory and storage and interfaces and and buses and . Although a particular distributed antenna system is depicted having a particular number of particular components in a particular arrangement this disclosure contemplates any suitable distributed antenna system having any suitable number of any suitable components in any suitable arrangement. For simplicity similar components of base station remote transceiver and endpoint will be discussed together while referring to the component of base station . However it is not necessary for these devices to have the same components or the same type of components. For example processor may be a general purpose microprocessor and processor may be an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

Processor may be a microprocessor controller or any other suitable computing device resource or combination of hardware software and or encoded logic operable to provide either alone or in conjunction with other components e.g. memory wireless networking functionality. Such functionality may include providing various wireless features discussed herein. For example processor may determine how to assign transceivers to sets . Additional examples and functionality provided at least in part by processor will be discussed below.

In particular embodiments processor may include hardware for executing instructions such as those making up a computer program. As an example and not by way of limitation to execute instructions processor may retrieve or fetch instructions from an internal register an internal cache memory or storage decode and execute them and then write one or more results to an internal register an internal cache memory or storage .

This disclosure contemplates processor including any suitable number of any suitable internal caches where appropriate. As an example and not by way of limitation processor may include one or more instruction caches one or more data caches and one or more translation lookaside buffers TLBs . Instructions in the instruction caches may be copies of instructions in memory or storage and the instruction caches may speed up retrieval of those instructions by processor . Data in the data caches may be copies of data in memory or storage for instructions executing at processor to operate on the results of previous instructions executed at processor for access by subsequent instructions executing at processor or for writing to memory or storage or other suitable data. The data caches may speed up read or write operations by processor . The TLBs may speed up virtual address translations for processor . In particular embodiments processor may include one or more internal registers for data instructions or addresses. Depending on the embodiment processor may include any suitable number of any suitable internal registers where appropriate. Where appropriate processor may include one or more arithmetic logic units ALUs be a multi core processor include one or more processors or any other suitable processor.

Memory may be any form of volatile or non volatile memory including without limitation magnetic media optical media random access memory RAM read only memory ROM flash memory removable media or any other suitable local or remote memory component or components. In particular embodiments memory may include random access memory RAM . This RAM may be volatile memory where appropriate. Where appropriate this RAM may be dynamic RAM DRAM or static RAM SRAM . Moreover where appropriate this RAM may be single ported or multi ported RAM or any other suitable type of RAM or memory. Memory may include one or more memories where appropriate. Memory may store any suitable data or information utilized by base station including software embedded in a computer readable medium and or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored e.g. firmware . In particular embodiments memory may include main memory for storing instructions for processor to execute or data for processor to operate on. In particular embodiments one or more memory management units MMUs may reside between processor and memory and facilitate accesses to memory requested by processor .

As an example and not by way of limitation base station may load instructions from storage or another source such as for example another computer system another base station or a remote transceiver to memory . Processor may then load the instructions from memory to an internal register or internal cache. To execute the instructions processor may retrieve the instructions from the internal register or internal cache and decode them. During or after execution of the instructions processor may write one or more results which may be intermediate or final results to the internal register or internal cache. Processor may then write one or more of those results to memory .

The method begins at step where connections between a base station and a plurality of remote transceivers is established. In particular embodiments the connections comprise wired connections between the base station and each remote transceiver . In some embodiments the connections between the base station and the plurality of remote transceivers comprise a CPRI connection. Depending on the embodiment the plurality of remote transceivers are arranged in a cascaded topology a star topology a tree topology ring topology or other suitable topology.

At step the transceivers are assigned to a plurality of sets . The transceivers that are assigned may include one or more remote transceivers and base station . Each set may include one or more transceivers. At step one or more logical ports is assigned to each set . Each logical port may correspond to one or more physical antenna ports of a transceiver assigned to the same set as the logical port. A logical port may correspond to a single physical antenna port or multiple physical antenna ports that transmit the same channel reference signal.

At step a channel reference signal is transmitted from each logical port of each set . That is the channel reference signal of a logical port is transmitted by the one or more physical antenna ports to which the logical port corresponds. The channel reference signals may be transmitted at specified intervals and may be transmitted using particular resources e.g. time frequency or code . The channel reference signals transmitted by logical ports of the same set may use the same resources while the channel reference signals transmitted by logical ports of different sets may use different resources if they are associated with the same cell identifier. In certain embodiments channel reference signals transmitted by logical ports of different sets that are associated with different cell identifiers may use the same resources.

At step signal quality feedback is received from an endpoint . The endpoint measures the channel reference signals sent by the logical ports of each set and provides signal quality feedback particular to each set. The signal quality feedback for a set may indicate the strength of the channel reference signal received from the logical ports of the set . The endpoint sends the signal quality feedback to the base station . In particular embodiments endpoint is configured to only measure channel reference signals from logical ports of sets associated with the primary cell of endpoint .

At step a location of the endpoint is determined based on the signal quality feedback. For example base station may determine that endpoint is located close to a particular transceiver or group of transceivers or near a boundary between two or more transceivers. At step the endpoint is instructed to provide signal quality feedback for a subset of the plurality of sets . For example endpoint may be instructed to provide signal quality feedback for the two sets with the best signal quality feedback.

At step a set is selected for communication with the endpoint based on the signal quality feedback. For example if the signal quality feedback indicates that a channel reference signal from a particular set was the strongest of the channel reference signals measured by endpoint the particular set may be selected for communication with the endpoint . At step data traffic is communicated with the endpoint through the physical antenna ports of the selected set. For example a MIMO scheme may be used to transmit data traffic from the physical antenna ports of the selected set via a PDSCH.
