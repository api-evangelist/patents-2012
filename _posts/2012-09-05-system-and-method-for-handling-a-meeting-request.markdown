This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 702 501 filed Feb. 9 2010 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 284 917 on Oct. 9 2012 the entireties of which are both hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to electronic devices and more particularly to a system and method for handling a meeting request on an electronic device.

Electronic devices including communication devices and wireless devices such as mobile communication devices may communicate with each other through conventional email and also through newer media such as Instant Messaging IM forums. Voice communication may also be available between electronic devices. Certain functions available via email e.g. using the MIME standard and managing of calendar events such as meeting requests may not integrate with other communication media such as voice.

For example a meeting organizer requests a meeting with several attendees and replies to the meeting request are sent from the attendees for example via email. If there is a meeting conflict or if the meeting request changes the organizer and attendees have to communicate over a relatively inefficient medium in this example email to resolve the conflict or the change.

It will be noted that throughout the appended drawings like features are identified by like reference numerals.

In some aspects there is provided a data processing and communications device comprising at least one data processor configured to execute machine interpretable instructions for causing the device to generate using command signals received from at least one user input device a signal set representing a meeting request the meeting request signal set comprising signals representing one or more parameters for a proposed meeting and configured for causing a second data processing and communications device to initiate a voice call on receipt of command signals representing a response to the meeting request and forward the generated meeting request signal set to the second data processing and communications device.

Reference is first made to which shows a block diagram illustrating an electronic device suitable for handling a meeting request in accordance with an example embodiment of the present disclosure. It will be understood that references to an electronic device in this disclosure may also refer to a wireless device a communication device a data processing and communications device or a mobile communication device. In the example shown the electronic device may communicate through a wireless communication network . The wireless network may include antennae base stations and supporting radio equipment as for supporting wireless communications between the electronic device and other devices connected to wireless network . The wireless network may be coupled to a wireless network gateway and to a wide area network shown in .

In an example embodiment the electronic device may be a two way mobile communication device having at least voice and data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other computer systems. Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device it may be referred to as a data messaging device a two way pager a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities a wireless Internet appliance or a data communication device with or without telephony capabilities . The electronic device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver stations within its geographic coverage area.

The electronic device may incorporate a communication subsystem which includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . In an example embodiment the antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the electronic device . As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communications the particular design of the communication subsystem may depend on the wireless network in which the electronic device is intended to operate.

The electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network for example after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network may be input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal may allow more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted may be processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals may be input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP may not only process communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device via a memory module such as a memory module which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or a Universal Subscriber Identity Module USIM card for use in a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS . The SIM card may be inserted in or connected to an interface of the electronic device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network . Alternatively the electronic device may have an integrated identity module for use with systems such as Code Division Multiple Access CDMA systems.

The electronic device may also include a battery interface for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . The battery may provide electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device and the battery interface may provide a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface may be coupled to a regulator not shown which may provide power V to the circuitry of the electronic device .

The electronic device may include a microprocessor which may control the overall operation of the electronic device . Communication functions including at least data and voice communications may be performed through the communication subsystem . The microprocessor may also interact with additional device subsystems such as a display a flash memory a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems a data port such as serial port a keyboard or keypad a speaker or audio port for connecting to for example a set of headphones or an earpiece a microphone a clickable thumbwheel or thumbwheel a short range communications subsystem and any other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in may perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions. Notably some subsystems such as the keypad the display and the clickable thumbwheel for example may be used for both communication related functions such as displaying notifications or entering a text message for transmission over the wireless network and executing device resident functions such as a clock a calculator or a task list. Operating system software used by the microprocessor may be stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory which may alternatively be the ROM or similar storage element. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the operating system specific device applications or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM .

The microprocessor in addition to its operating system functions may enable execution of software applications on the electronic device . A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications may normally be installed on the electronic device during or after manufacture. The electronic device may include a personal information manager PIM application having the ability to organize and manage data items relating to a user such as but not limited to instant messaging email calendar events voice mails appointments and task items. One or more memory stores may be available on the electronic device to facilitate storage of information such as the flash memory the RAM the ROM the memory module or other types of memory storage devices or FLASH memory cards represented by the other device subsystems such as Secure Digital SD cards or mini SD cards etc.

The PIM and or media applications may have the ability to send and receive data items via either the wireless network or a link to a computer system. The link to the computer system may be via the serial port or the short range communications subsystem . In an example embodiment PIM and or media data items may be seamlessly combined synchronized and updated via the wireless network with the electronic device user s corresponding data items stored and or associated with a host computer system thereby creating a mirrored or partially mirrored host computer on the electronic device with respect to such items. This may be useful where the host computer system is the electronic device user s office computer system. Additional applications may also be loaded onto the electronic device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communications subsystem or any other suitable subsystem and installed by a user in the RAM or a non volatile store such as the ROM for execution by the microprocessor . Such flexibility in application installation may increase the functionality of the electronic device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the electronic device .

In a data communication mode a received data signal representing information such as a text message an email message a media file to be transferred or Web page download may be processed by the communication subsystem and may be input to the microprocessor . The microprocessor may further process the signal for output to the display or alternatively to the auxiliary I O device . A user of the electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the keypad and or the clickable thumbwheel in conjunction with the primary display and possibly the auxiliary I O device . The keypad may be either a complete alphanumeric keypad or telephone type keypad. These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network or via the short range communication subsystem .

For voice communications the overall operation of the electronic device may be similar except that the received signals may be output to the speaker or audio port and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output may be typically accomplished primarily through the speaker or audio port the display may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information. Stereo headphones or an earpiece may also be used in place of the speaker .

The serial port may be normally implemented in a personal digital assistant PDA type communication device for which synchronization with a user s computer is a desirable albeit optional component. The serial port may enable a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and may extend the capabilities of the electronic device by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example be used to load software or data files onto the electronic device through a direct reliable and trusted connection.

The short range communications subsystem may be an additional optional component which provides for communication between the electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. . In another example embodiment the short range communications subsystem may be a wireless networking communications subsystem conforming to IEEE 802.11 standards such as one or more of 802.11b 802.11g or 802.11n.

The WLAN may comprise a network which in some examples conforms to IEEE 802.11 standards such as one or more of 802.11b 802.11g or 802.11n however other communications protocols may also be used for the WLAN . The WLAN may include one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area. For the example embodiment depicted in the WLAN may be operated by an enterprise for example a business or university in a building or campus type environment and the access points may be connected to an access point AP interface . The AP interface may provide translation and routing services between the access points and the network provider system to facilitate communication between two or more of the electronic devices and other devices e.g. such as desktop computers connected directly or indirectly to the network provider system . The AP interface may be implemented using a computer for example a server running a suitable computer program or software.

According to an example embodiment the other interfaces may be implemented using a physical interface . The physical interface may include an Ethernet Universal Serial Bus USB Firewire or infrared IR connection implemented to exchange information between the network provider system and the electronic device .

The network provider system may comprise a server or server module or a number of servers or server modules which may be located behind a firewall not shown . The network provider system may include a number of modules including a mobile data delivery module . Various modules running on the network provider system may be implemented as a number of services running on a single server or as a number of interconnected servers each running a software program to implement the functionality of the respective module. The network provider system may provide access for the one or more electronic devices through either the wireless WAN the WLAN or the other connection to the electronic devices connected for example through an enterprise network e.g. an intranet to the network provider system . In an example embodiment the data delivery module may be implemented on a computer such as the network provider system .

The enterprise network may comprise a local area network an intranet the Internet a direct connection or combinations thereof The enterprise network may comprise an intranet for a corporation or other type of organization. In at least some example embodiments the network provider system may be part of the enterprise network and may be located behind a corporate firewall and connected to the wireless network gateway through the Internet. A computer e.g. a desktop or laptop computer which may belong to the user of the electronic device may be connected to the enterprise network . As described earlier the electronic device may be temporarily and directly connected to the computer using for example the serial port . Alternatively the electronic device may communicate with the computer using the communication subsystem and the WAN and or the short range communications subsystem and the WLAN .

As shown in an application content server may be connected to the enterprise network and also to another network for example a Wide Area Network WAN . In some example embodiments an email server and or the content server may form part of the enterprise network . The WAN may further connect to other networks. The WAN may comprise or be configured with the Internet a direct connection a LAN a wireless communication link or any combination thereof. Content providers such as Web servers may be connected to the WAN an example of which is shown in as an origin server .

According to an example embodiment the mobile data delivery module may provide connectivity between the wireless WAN and the WLAN and the other connection and devices and or networks connected directly or indirectly to the network provider system . In an example embodiment the connectivity provided may be Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP based connectivity providing an Internet based service connection to devices connected to the wireless WAN the WLAN or the other connection and devices and or networks connected directly or indirectly to the network provider system . The network the application content server the WAN and the origin server may individually and or collectively in various combinations act as a content source for the network provider system . It will be appreciated that the system shown in comprises but one possible communication network or configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the electronic devices .

Reference is now made to which shows in block diagram form an example system generally designated suitable for the control and management of voice communications for the electronic device . The system includes the business or enterprise system which in some example embodiments includes a local area network LAN . In the description below the business or enterprise system may be referred to as an enterprise network . It will be appreciated that the enterprise network may include more than one network and may be located in multiple geographic areas in some example embodiments.

The enterprise network may be connected for example through a firewall to a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. The enterprise network may also be connected to a public switched telephone network PSTN for example via direct inward dialing DID trunks or primary rate interface PRI trunks.

The enterprise network may also communicate with a public land mobile network PLMN which in some examples may be the wireless WAN or in some examples a cellular network. The connection with the PLMN may be made via a relay .

The enterprise network may also include the wireless local area network WLAN featuring wireless access points. Other WLANs may exist outside the enterprise network . For example WLAN may be connected to WAN .

The system may include one or more electronic devices only one shown which may be enterprise associated devices. In some examples the electronic device may be a device equipped for cellular communication through the PLMN an electronic device equipped for Wi Fi communications over one of the WLANs or a dual mode device capable of both cellular and WLAN communications. WLANs may be configured in accordance with one of the IEEE 802.11 specifications.

The electronic device may include one or more radio transceivers and associated processing hardware and software to enable wireless communications with the PLMN and or one of the WLANs . In various example embodiments the PLMN and the electronic device may be configured to operate in compliance with any one or more of a number of wireless protocols including GSM GPRS CDMA EDGE UMTS EvDO HSPA 3GPP or a variety of others. It will be appreciated that the electronic device may roam within the PLMN and across PLMNs in known manner as the user moves. In some examples where the electronic device is a dual mode electronic device the dual mode electronic device and or the enterprise network are configured to facilitate roaming between the PLMN and a WLAN and are thus capable of seamlessly transferring sessions such as voice calls from a connection with the cellular interface of the dual mode electronic device to the WLAN interface of the dual mode device and vice versa.

The enterprise network typically includes a number of networked servers computers and other devices. For example the enterprise network may connect one or more desktop or laptop computers one shown . The connection may be wired or wireless in some example embodiments. The enterprise network may also connect to one or more digital telephone sets one shown .

The enterprise network may include one or more mail servers such as an email server for coordinating the transmission storage and receipt of electronic messages for client devices operating within the enterprise network . Examples of email servers include the Microsoft Exchange Server and the IBM Lotus Domino server. Each user within the enterprise typically has at least one user account within the enterprise network . Associated with each user account is message address information such as an email address. Messages addressed to a user message address associated with a user are stored on the enterprise network in the email server . The messages may be retrieved by the user using a messaging application such as an email client application. The messaging application may be operating on a user s computer or electronic device connected to the enterprise network within the enterprise. In some example embodiments the user may be permitted to access stored messages using a remote computer for example at another location via the WAN using a VPN connection. Using the messaging application the user may also compose and send messages addressed to others within or outside the enterprise network . The messaging application provides instructions to the email server to send a composed message to the addressee for example via the WAN .

The relay serves to route messages received over the PLMN from the electronic device to the corresponding enterprise network . The relay also pushes messages from the enterprise network to the electronic device via the PLMN .

In this example the enterprise network also includes an enterprise server . Together with the relay the enterprise server functions to redirect or relay incoming email messages addressed to a user s email address within the enterprise network to the user s electronic device and to relay incoming email messages composed and sent via the electronic device out to the intended recipients within the WAN or elsewhere. The enterprise server and relay together facilitate push email service for the electronic device enabling the user to send and receive e mail messages using the electronic device as though the user were connected to an email client within the enterprise network using the user s enterprise related email address for example on computer .

The enterprise network includes a Private Branch eXchange although in various example embodiments the PBX may be a standard PBX or an IP PBX for simplicity the description below uses the term PBX to refer to both having a connection with the PSTN for routing incoming and outgoing voice calls for the enterprise. The PBX is connected to the PSTN via DID trunks or PRI trunks for example. The PBX may use ISDN signaling protocols for setting up and tearing down circuit switched connections through the PSTN and related signaling and communications. In some example embodiments the PBX may be connected to one or more conventional analog telephones . The PBX is also connected to the enterprise network and through it to telephone terminal devices such as digital telephone sets softphones operating on computers etc. Within the enterprise each individual may have an associated extension number sometimes referred to as a PNP private numbering plan or direct dial phone number. In some examples calls outgoing from the PBX to the PSTN or incoming from the PSTN to the PBX are circuit switched calls. Within the enterprise e.g. between the PBX and terminal devices voice calls may be packet switched calls for example Voice over IP VoIP calls.

The enterprise network may further include a Service Management Platform SMP for performing at least some aspects of messaging or session control for example call control and advanced call processing features. The SMP may in some examples also perform some media handling. Collectively the SMP and PBX may be referred to as the enterprise communications platform generally designated . It will be appreciated that the enterprise communications platform and in particular the SMP is implemented on one or more servers having suitable communications interfaces for connecting to and communicating with the PBX and or DID PRI trunks Although the SMP may be implemented on a stand alone server it will be appreciated that it may alternatively be implemented into an existing control agent server as a logical software component. The SMP may be implemented as a multi layer platform.

The enterprise communications platform implements the switching to connect session legs and may provide the conversion between for example a circuit switched call and a VoIP call or to connect legs of other media sessions. In some example embodiments in the context of voice calls the enterprise communications platform provides a number of additional functions for example including automated attendant interactive voice response call forwarding voice mail etc. It may also implement certain usage restrictions on enterprise users for example blocking international calls or 1 900 calls. In some example embodiments Session Initiation Protocol SIP may be used to set up manage and terminate media sessions for voice calls. Other protocols may also be employed by the enterprise communications platform for example Web Services Computer Telephony Integration CTI protocol Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE and various custom Application Programming Interfaces APIs as will be described in greater detail below.

The enterprise communications platform may serve to extend the features of enterprise telephony to the electronic devices . For example the enterprise communications platform may allow the electronic device to perform functions akin to those normally available on a standard office telephone such as the digital telephone set or analog telephone set . Example features may include direct extension dialing enterprise voice mail conferencing call transfer call park etc.

Reference is next made to which shows a block diagram illustrating a memory of the electronic device . The memory may have various software components for controlling the electronic device and may include for example the flash memory the RAM the ROM the memory module and or the other device subsystems . In accordance with an example embodiment the electronic device may be a multi tasking mobile communication device for sending and receiving data items such as instant messages for making and receiving voice calls and for creating events and alerts. To provide a user friendly environment to control the operation of the electronic device an operating system OS resident on the electronic device may provide a basic set of operations for supporting various applications typically operable through a user interface such as a graphical user interface GUI .

For example the operating system may provide basic input output system features to obtain input from the auxiliary I O the keypad the clickable thumbwheel and other input devices and to facilitate output to the user for example via the display . The GUI is typically a component of the OS . One or more software modules for managing communications or providing a personal digital assistant PDA or other functions may also be included. The OS may include a calendar application for managing calendar events for example including scheduling events generating meeting requests accepting meeting requests and tracking or indicating the status of meeting requests. The OS may also include a voice call application for managing voice calls. The calendar application and the voice call application may interact with each other as will be described further below.

The calendar application and the voice call application may be included among the software modules . Thus the electronic device may include computer executable programmed instructions or code for directing the electronic device to implement various applications. The programmed instructions or code may be tangibly embodied in the one or more software modules resident in the memory of the electronic device . Alternatively the programmed instructions may be tangibly embodied on a computer readable medium such as a DVD CD floppy disk or other storage media having computer executable instructions or code tangibly recorded thereon which may be used for transporting the programmed instructions to the memory of the electronic device . Alternatively the programmed instructions may be embedded in a computer readable signal that may be uploaded to the wireless network by a vendor or supplier of the programmed instructions and this signal may be downloaded through one or more of the interfaces to the electronic device from for example the wireless network by end users.

The present disclosure provides a voice reply rule associated with a meeting request that requires a voice reply to the meeting request. The voice reply rule is defined by a meeting organizer when configuring the meeting request. When an attendee replies to a meeting request having a voice reply rule a voice call to the meeting organizer is automatically initiated. The voice reply rule may include settings that specify one or more conditions under which a voice reply is required. The voice reply rule may be used to require a voice reply in place of a non voice reply e.g. an email or other convention reply or in addition to a non voice reply.

In some examples handling of the meeting request occurs at the calendar application . For example the meeting organizer defines the voice reply rule for a meeting request using the calendar application on the organizer s device. Similarly for example the calendar application on the attendee s device in response to the attendee s selection of a reply to the meeting request interacts with the voice call application to initiate a voice call in accordance with the voice reply rule.

In some examples information about the meeting request and information about replies to the meeting request are stored in the calendar application . The calendar application at each of the organizer s and the attendee s devices may track or indicate the status of the meeting request for each attendee. For example the meeting request may be considered unreplied for an attendee if that attendee has not yet replied to the meeting request the meeting request may be considered replied if the meeting request has been replied to and the meeting request may be considered semi replied if that attendee has made an unsuccessful or incomplete attempt to reply to the meeting request.

Reference is now made to which is a flowchart illustrating an example method of handling message requests according to an example embodiment. The method is an example method for generating a message request having a voice reply rule. Reference is also made to illustrating an example set of communications between an organizer s device and an attendee s device according to an example embodiment. Each of the organizer s device and the attendee s device may be the electronic device or the computer or any other suitable computing device.

At an instruction to define a voice reply rule for a meeting request is received. In some examples the instructions may be received as command signals from the input device such as the keyboard or the thumbwheel . For example a signal representing the instruction is received at the calendar application of the organizer s device such as in response to a user input. For example this may be in response to a selection by a meeting organizer to create a voice reply rule for a new or existing meeting request using an electronic device or a computer . This may be an option provided as part of the generation of a meeting request. In addition to providing the option to define the voice reply rule the meeting organizer may be provided with other meeting request options such as an option to select a list of attendees and for configuring the meeting request e.g. start time end time location notes etc. . The voice reply rule may include settings that specify when a voice reply is required e.g. which attendees require a voice reply type of response requiring a voice reply hard or soft voice reply rule which will be described further below.

In some examples the voice reply rule may be pre defined in the organizer s device e.g. such a rule may be pre defined by the organizer prior to creation of the meeting request in which case defining a voice reply rule for the present meeting request may require only the selection of a pre defined rule from a list of available pre defined rules. For example it may be the case that a voice reply is always required from attendee A in which case the organizer s device may have stored a pre defined voice reply rule specifying that a voice reply is required for attendee A. This pre defined rule may be selected by the organizer when the meeting request is generated or may be automatically associated with any meeting request that includes attendee A.

At the voice reply rule is associated with the meeting request. The voice reply rule specifies a voice call for replying to the meeting request for example according to the settings selected in . Thus the meeting request including the voice reply rule is generated. In some examples the meeting request may be in the form of a signal set including signals representing one or more parameters for a proposed meeting e.g. start time end time location notes etc. which would be interpreted by the electronic device or the computer as a meeting request. The voice reply rule may be in the form of signals within the signal set that cause the attendees devices to initiate a voice call upon receipt of command signals e.g. signals representing an attendee response in response to the meeting request.

At the meeting request including the voice reply rule is transmitted. For example a signal set representing the meeting request is sent out such as using the communication subsystem . The meeting request is transmitted to the attendees devices for example via the communication system or the system . The meeting request may include information for establishing a voice call with the organizer for example a phone number or other contact information for the organizer.

A voice call initiated in accordance with the voice reply rule may be received at the organizer s device . For example a signal set from the attendee s device representing a request for establishing a voice call is received at the voice call application of the organizer s device . The signal from the attendee s device may be in response to a reply e.g. command signals representing a response at the attendee s device to the meeting request at the attendee s device as will be described further below. The voice call may be accepted and a voice call established between the attendee and the organizer. This may be according to conventional voice call methods. Once the voice call is established the meeting request may be considered replied at both the attendee s device and the organizer s device for example the meeting may be marked with the reply e.g. accept decline or tentative in the respective calendar application of each of the attendee s device and the organizer s device . For example a signal set may be generated at the organizer s device and or the attendee s device to indicate that the meeting request has been replied to.

Reference is now made to showing an example interface for generating or configuring a meeting request in accordance with an example embodiment. The interface may be provided to the meeting organizer for example as part of the method . In the example shown the interface provides an option for selecting a meeting status an option for setting a reminder an option to set a conference call an option to set recurrence and option to set a private status and an option to define a voice reply rule . In response to a selection of the option the organizer may be provided with a further interface not shown for configuring voice reply rule settings e.g. attendees requiring a voice reply type of response requiring a voice reply hard or soft voice reply rule .

Reference is now made to which is a flowchart illustrating an example method for managing meeting requests in accordance with an example embodiment. The method is an example method for responding to a meeting requesting having a voice reply rule. Reference is again made to .

At a meeting request including a voice reply rule is received. For example a signal set representing the meeting request is received at the attendee s device such as at the calendar application . The voice reply rule specifies a voice call is required for replying to the meeting request. As described with reference to in some examples the signal set representing the meeting request includes signals representing parameters for the meeting and the voice reply rule may be in the form of signals for causing the attendee s device to initiate a voice call upon receipt of a response e.g. in the form of command signals to the meeting request.

At a notification of the meeting request is displayed. For example a pop up a GUI or other suitable interface is displayed on the display informing the attendee that a voice call is required to reply to the meeting request. The notification may provide an option to select an accept decline or tentative reply to the meeting request. In some examples the notification is in the form of an email.

At a reply to the meeting request is received. For example a command signal representing the reply to the meeting request is received such as at the calendar application in response to input from the attendee. The reply may be a selection of accept decline or tentative . The reply to the meeting request may be in response to the notification displayed in . For example when the attendee is first notified of the meeting request e.g. via a pop up a GUI or other suitable interface the attendee may right away select a reply option via the notification. Alternatively the reply to the meeting request may be via a later selection of the meeting request. For example the attendee may not reply right away to the notification but at a later time open up the meeting request e.g. using the calendar application and select a reply option.

At in response to the reply received in and where specified by the voice reply rule an instruction to initiate a voice call in accordance with the voice reply rule is transmitted. For example a signal set representing the instruction to initiate the voice call is transmitted such as from the calendar application to the voice call application . The voice call application then initiates the voice call to the meeting organizer according to conventional methods. For example initiation of the voice call may be through via Session Initial Protocol SIP based on contact information of the organizer s device included in the meeting request.

In some examples where the attendee s device does not include voice capabilities or is otherwise unable to support the implementation of the voice reply rule the voice reply rule may not be processed and the voice call may not be initiated. In some examples where the voice reply rule cannot be implemented on an attendee s device signals representing a failure to implement the voice reply rule may be transmitted to the organizer s device e.g. in the form of an error message .

The instruction is transmitted only where specified by the voice reply rule and in accordance with the voice reply rule. For example the voice reply rule may include one or more voice reply rule settings that specify a voice reply is required for one or more conditions.

A voice call between the organizer and the attendee may then be established using conventional methods for example using protocols such as SIP Web Services Computer Telephony Integration CTI protocol and other such suitable protocols.

Reference is now made to illustrating an example set of communications between the organizer s device and the attendee s device . As in a signal set is transmitted representing a meeting requesting including a voice reply rule and a reply to the meeting request is made at the attendee s device .

In the example shown where a voice reply is required in accordance with the voice reply rule when a voice call attempt is made from the attendee to the organizer for example at an additional non voice reply which may be a conventional reply such as an email reply is transmitted from the attendee to the organizer in parallel with the voice reply attempt. For example a signal set representing a non voice reply to the meeting request is transmitted e.g. the non voice reply may be an email reply from the attendee s device to the organizer s device . The signal set representing the non voice reply may be received at the organizer s device for example at an email application even where a voice reply attempt fails e.g. where the organizer is not available to receive a voice call .

In some examples the reply to the meeting request is not considered fully replied to unless the required voice call between the attendee and the organizer in accordance with the voice reply rule is established. For example where a voice reply attempt fails between the attendee and the organizer the calendar application on the attendee s device may consider the meeting request as semi replied e.g. indicated with signals representing the status pending accept pending decline or pending tentative to indicate that an unsuccessful voice reply attempt was made to respond to the meeting request . In the example where a non voice reply is transmitted in parallel with the voice reply where the voice call attempt fails when the non voice reply is received at the organizer s device in the absence of an established voice call the calendar application on the organizer s device may similarly mark the meeting request as being semi replied by that attendee .

In some examples when a voice call request is received at the organizer s device but before a voice call is established between the attendee and the organizer the organizer may be presented with an additional message such as an automated message via the enterprise communication platform or the enterprise server indicating that the voice call is in response to the meeting request. The message may also provide the option of accepting or declining the voice call. If the option to accept the voice call is selected then the voice call between the attendee and the organizer is established. When the voice call is established between the organizer and the attendee the meeting request is considered replied e.g. indicated by the respective calendar applications on each user s device as accepted declined or tentative by both the organizer s device and the attendee s device .

In some examples the voice reply rule may include at least one voice reply rule setting specifying at least one condition where a voice reply is required. For example the voice reply rule setting may specify an attendee requiring a voice reply a reply type requiring a voice reply and a strictness level of the voice reply rule as described below. A voice reply rule may include one or more of these settings in any suitable combination. Other settings not described below may be included in the voice reply rule.

In an example of a voice reply rule setting the voice reply rule setting may specify one or more attendees requiring a voice reply. For example the organizer may right click on an attendee name not shown in the interface and select an option e.g. a Respond by voice option to specify that a voice reply is required from that attendee. This voice reply rule setting may provide the organizer with the option of selecting the attendees from whom a voice reply is required while a non voice reply e.g. a conventional email reply from the other attendees is sufficient. The organizer may thus be provided the option to limit voice replies to those attendees of particular interest or particular importance.

In another example of a voice reply rule setting the voice reply rule setting may specify that a voice call is required only for specific reply types such as selection of an accept or a decline reply. For example the voice reply rule setting may specify that a voice call is required when the reply to the meeting request is decline but not when the reply is accept . Thus if the attendee declines the meeting request then the meeting request is not considered replied until a voice call is established between the attendee and the organizer. However if the attendee accepts the meeting request then a non voice reply e.g. via email is sufficient for the meeting request to be considered replied and a voice call is not initiated. For example the organizer when configuring the meeting request may be provided with options for configuring the voice reply rule such as Only respond by voice if declined or Respond by voice if declined or tentative . This may provide the organizer with more flexibility for the voice reply rule and may limit the number of voice calls the organizer receives to only those that are of interest to the organizer. For example the organizer might not be concerned if an attendee accepts a meeting request but may wish to discuss cases where the meeting request is declined.

In another example of a voice reply rule setting the voice reply rule setting may specify how strictly the voice reply rule is applied. For example the voice reply rule setting may specify a hard voice reply rule or a soft voice reply rule. If a hard voice reply rule is specified the selected attendee is required to initiate a voice reply and the meeting request is not considered replied until a voice call has been established between the organizer and the attendee. Thus if the voice call attempt was unsuccessful another voice call attempt must be initiated by the attendee to reply to the meeting request. If a soft voice reply rule is specified the attendee is required to initiate a voice reply to the meeting request however if the voice call attempt is unsuccessful e.g. the organizer was away and the call was sent to voicemail the meeting request is still considered replied at the organizer s device . For example where a soft voice reply rule is specified a parallel transmission of a non voice reply as described above may be received at the organizer s device and may result in the meeting request being considered replied such as by the calendar application marking the meeting request as accepted in the absence of an established voice call. Thus the attendee is not required to attempt another voice call. For example the organizer may specify a hard voice reply rule an important meeting but a soft voice reply rule to an optional meeting. This may lessen the burden on the attendee to repeat voice call attempts.

The voice reply rule settings described above may be used alone or in combination. For example the voice reply rule may include a voice reply setting specifying the attendees requiring a voice reply and additionally include a voice reply setting specifying the strictness level of the voice reply rule for each specified attendee. This may allow the organizer to specify a hard voice reply rule for mandatory attendees but a soft voice reply rule for optional attendees. Other such combinations are possible and may include other voice reply rule settings not explicitly described above.

In some examples where the attendee responding according to a hard voice reply rule fails to establish a voice call with the organizer a notification e.g. a non voice reply such as an email is provided to the organizer that a reply to the meeting request was attempted by the attendee. This notification may also contain information about the nature of the reply for example whether the reply is accept decline or tentative . The information in the notification may provide the organizer with information to either call back to the attendee change the meeting request or ignore the notification and wait for the attendee to attempt another voice call. In some examples this notification may be the same as or included with the non voice reply e.g. email message described above.

In some examples where the meeting request including the voice reply rule has been sent to the attendees the voice reply rule may be subsequently changed or removed by the organizer. This may be possible even after an attendee has already replied to the meeting request. For example consider the case where an attendee attempts a voice reply but is unsuccessful in establishing a voice call with the organizer. Hence the meeting request is still considered unreplied in each of the organizer s or the attendee s respective calendar applications . Information about this attempted voice reply may be stored in the organizer s and or the attendee s device . This information may include for example time of attempt and the type of reply e.g. accept decline or tentative and may be provided in a non voice reply transmitted in parallel to the voice reply attempt. When the voice reply rule is removed or when the voice reply rule is changed such that a voice reply is no longer required e.g. the voice reply rule no longer specifies a required voice reply for that attendee or for an accept reply establishment of a voice call is no longer required for replying to the meeting request. This change to or removal of the voice reply rule may be communicated to the attendee s device for example by transmitting a signal set representing the updated meeting request with the voice reply rule having been changed or removed.

Information about the attempted reply e.g. information stored in the organizer s device and the attendee s device where the information is provided in a received non voice reply may be automatically applied to the meeting request such that the meeting request is considered replied e.g. is accordingly marked in the respective calendar applications on the organizer s and the attendee s devices . Where the stored information is stored only in the attendee s device e.g. where there is no parallel transmission of a non voice reply removal of the voice reply rule may trigger the attendee s device to automatically transmit a non voice reply to the meeting request for example by email the non voice reply including the stored information about the attempted reply resulting in the meeting request being considered replied e.g. accordingly marked in the respective calendar applications of the organizer s and the attendee s devices .

In some examples the stored information about the attempted reply may be additionally stored in a central server e.g. an email server and signals representing the stored information may be transmitted to the organizer s device automatically when the voice reply rule is removed or no longer applicable. Signals may be similarly transmitted to the attendee s device . The respective calendar applications in the organizer s device and or the attendee s device may be updated accordingly.
