The playlist information includes a basic stream selection table and an extension stream selection table.

The extension stream selection table shows elementary streams that are permitted to be played back only in a stereoscopic playback mode. The stream entry in the extension stream selection table indicates a packet identifier that is to be used by the playback device to perform demultiplexing when the playback device is in the stereoscopic playback mode and the corresponding stream number is set in the stream number register provided in the playback device.
