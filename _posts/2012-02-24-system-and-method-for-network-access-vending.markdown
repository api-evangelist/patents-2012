The invention relates generally to managing network resources and more specifically but not exclusively adapting resource pricing according to dynamic conditions.

Wireless access providers are experiencing explosive growth in data traffic due to smart phones tablets shared networking devices as well as new applications and services. These devices typically receive services from internet based applications and services rather than from providers own domains.

The present provider model is one of selling access or capacity to subscribers with plans that typically impose a monthly usage allowance. For a fixed fee subscribers can receive content independent of the network conditions. In response users of network capacity are sensitive to their total consumption but not sensitive to network loading levels such that bandwidth consuming applications are used independent of the impact on the network.

To satisfy user needs access providers must build out their networks to handle large peaks in subscriber traffic. This situation is particularly problematic for the air interface where the limited volume of traffic does not provide the same degree of statistical multiplexing as in the core network. Air interface traffic peaks typically occur only during limited time periods and on a limited number of cells. This leaves a huge amount of network data carrying capacity idle during non peak periods and therefore not monetized.

Various deficiencies of the prior art are addressed by the present invention of a method system and apparatus to provide a market in which network access itself rather than just bandwidth consumption is offered as a commodity for purchase by third parties at a price defined by contemporaneous network conditions service level or tier co sponsorship or advertising subsidy and the like.

Various embodiments for vending network access contemplate determining access pricing or tariffs for one or more of a plurality of network access regions using one or more of an eNB cell congestion level an eNB congestion level a quality of service level an access technology e.g. 2G vs. 3G vs. 4G a level of activity by a target subscriber and the like. The pricing is offered to potential access purchasers along with optional metadata indicative of illustratively user equipment and network parameters associated with the cell or eNB. The pricing may be offered via an API to allow automatic purchase decisions by access purchasers such as when pricing conditions are appropriate.

To facilitate understanding identical reference numerals have been used where possible to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.

The network management engine NME is generally adapted for providing various network management functions associated with illustratively LTE network . The NME performs various network management functions as known to those skilled in the art. Such functions include illustratively discovery of network elements and their interconnections provisioning paths to the network and monitoring various performance parameters associated with network elements links and or portions thereof.

Thus in addition to various other functions the network management engine retrieves configuration information status operating information and connection information regarding the elements sub elements and links forming the LTE network . Much of this information is dynamic and the retrieval of this information by the network management engine is ongoing. For example the underlying elements sub elements and links within the LTE network may change over time due to local network adaptations rerouting failures degradations scheduled maintenance and the like. In general the network management engine is adapted to provide management and monitoring of the various elements sub elements and links forming the LTE network .

Configuration information comprises information identifying a network element the function and or configuration of the network element the function and or configuration of the sub elements forming a network element and so on.

The market pricing engine MPE performs various functions associated with determining prices to be paid by third parties such as application content providers application service providers machine to machine M2M service providers and the like to access one or more portions of the LTE network . Various factors enter into the pricing determination mechanism including one or more of local network congestion levels intermediate network congestion levels requested service levels gold silver and bronze tiers for example most favored buyer status pre existing business arrangements pre existing service level agreements advertising offset opportunities and so on. Generally speaking the cost of access via the LTE network increases as the network becomes more utilized and decreases as the network becomes less utilized as will be discussed in more detail below.

The market pricing engine stores current and optionally historical market pricing information within the market database MD . The market pricing engine interfaces to the LTE network and ensures that current pricing levels are applied to data sent to from the APs.

The market transaction engine MTE performs various functions associated with access purchases and other transactions with the various access purchasers APs such as access content providers application service providers machine to machine service monitoring providers or any other entity interested in purchasing network access for itself or its customers.

The market transaction engine interacts with access purchasers to advertise offer network access at various regions various prices and so on as determined by the market pricing engine . The various regions may comprise individual mobile sites such as a base station or eNodeB specifically defined geographic regions such as a city or other delineated region.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the functions of the market pricing engine market transaction engine and or market database may be implemented as part of the management system as depicted herein as part of a dedicated computing system server located proximate or remote from the management system or as part of a standalone access market brokering system.

Various embodiments will now be discussed within the context of vending access to wireless network users associated with a particular region namely a single cellular region such as associated with one base station or eNodeB.

At step per cell or per eNB network congestion information is obtained. Referring to box this information may be obtained via network monitoring tools the network management system user equipment or devices and so on. Moreover the network congestion information may comprise current network conditions or historic network conditions.

For example various network monitoring tools may be access core network vendor agnostic monitoring messages and transport on standardized interfaces or the tools may be network vendor proprietary interfacing to network elements or the OA M systems. Per cell or per eNB network congestion information may include data associated with any of the air interface backhaul and core network. Network congestion information may also include indications of network element status such as network node processor occupancy memory availability and so on the may be affected by network loading congestion.

At optional step other information useful in determining network access value is obtained. Referring to box such other information may include connectivity technology used e.g. LTE UMTS WiFi and the like user equipment status e.g. processor occupancy memory availability and the like quality of access level e.g. gold silver runs and the like quality of experience QoE level request or need for guaranteed bandwidth minimum bandwidth best effort bandwidth and other information factors.

At step per cell or per eNB network access pricing is determined using obtained network congestion information and or other information as described herein. Generally speaking while prices may be formulated based upon many factors such as multiple access grades and the like congestion levels at the cell and or eNodeB are highly determinative. Prices will tend to rise and fall in relation to congestion levels though this relationship is not necessarily linear. Generally speaking a network region to be associated with an access price or tariff may comprise a region serviced by one or more of an eNodeB an eNodeB cell a NodeB a Node B cell a base transceiver station BTS a BTS cell and so on.

At step the determined per cell or per eNB access pricing is offered or advertised. Optionally metadata associated with the network and or with user equipment is included with the advertise network access price. For example metadata identifying a user device and a cell within which the device is located will enable an access purchaser to correctly identify the appropriate cell or Gateway servicing the user device such as to enable content streaming and the like.

Referring to box the offered per seller per eNB network access may be advertised via a network access broker and electronic data interchange an application programming interface API for an application service via an API for the content distribution service via an API for an M2M service the via a secure application API via a trusted agent via a secure certificate or by some other mechanism. For example in one embodiment pricing as well as other meta data indicating UE status and access network state are offered via RESTful APIs interfaced to applications. The APIs pass through illustratively a secure interface such as a Web Services Gateway illustratively the Alcatel Lucent Open API Platform OAP .

Generally speaking the method of is adapted to determine pricing associated with per cell per eNB or some other network access segment such as a specific region carrier service class and the like. The determined pricing is offered to access purchasers via one or more mechanisms some of which optionally include metadata useful in enabling access purchasers to identify the appropriate network access to be purchased for specific subscribers or users.

Thus in various embodiments of a method for vending network access access pricing or tariffs for one or more of a plurality of network access regions is determined using one or more of an eNB cell congestion level an eNB congestion level a quality of service level an access technology e.g. 2G vs. 3G vs. 4G a level of activity by a target subscriber and the like.

At step a network access purchase request is received from an access purchaser AP . Referring to box the access purchase request may be received via a marketplace API such as discussed above with respect to step of box or via some other mechanism.

At step the type of application associated with the network access purchase request is identified such that appropriate network provisioning charging and general fulfillment requirements may be satisfied. Referring to box types of applications include sponsored content applications machine to machine M2M applications applications where network access is a supporting attribute and other applications. A sponsored content application may comprise an application in which the application provider sponsors content for subscribers. The sponsored content may be an application provided promotion selected by the subscriber as part of an offering by the application content provider or linked to a service plan. A M2M application may comprise a threshold triggered decision by a machine or other processing element that network access pricing is appropriate for a relevant data transfer. An application where network access is a supporting attribute may comprise a device or appliance dependent application by which purchased content such as books or streaming content is delivered to the device or appliance by one or more networks without a subscriber incurring further access charges for this delivery or having the content count against a monthly usage allowance.

At step interaction with the network management engine is provided to fulfill the network access purchase request. For example referring to box in one 4G LTE embodiment the service purchase request and any service grade information is forwarded to the Policy and Charging Resource Function PCRF entity by the management system via the OAP. Generally speaking the PCRF adapts policy and charging based network functions to ensure that the service level associated with the access purchase request is satisfied and that the application initiating the access purchase request is appropriately charged for this network access at the determined pricing.

For example if a better than best effort level of service has been selected in the axis purchase request in one embodiment the PCRF sets up a QoS bearer corresponding the grade of service selected using 3GPP standardized mechanisms. The PCRF also establishes a charging rule for the requested content and promulgates the information to the policy enforcement point PGW in LTE . The LTE packet Gateway PGW counts packets associated with the application separately from other packets being sent to the user. If the signature e.g. a 5 tuple or other signature of the content is unknown or was not included within the axis purchase request then the PGW may use DPI to detect the flow associated with the application that has purchased access. Generally speaking the PGW operates to ensure that purchased application related packets are not attributed to the subscriber bandwidth allocation rather these packets are chargeable to the network access purchasing application or entity. It is noted that the charging system which may be an online or off line charging system rates the packet counts for 3rd party purchased access separately from packet counts associated with other subscriber activity.

Generally speaking the method of is adapted to receive network access purchase requests from applications and interact with the network management engine and or other network management components as necessary to fulfill the axis purchase request and charge the requesting application or entity for this service.

The various embodiments described herein advantageously allow application service providers content providers and others to purchase access at a price that is correlated with network congestion levels and or other factors. When congestion levels are high the price for access rises in the marketplace discouraging consumption of network resources in the marketplace. When network resources are idle the price for access falls in the marketplace and applications may make purchases for delivery of their content at economical prices.

Various embodiments of the invention utilize RESTful APIs exposed by the operator that 3rd party content providers may access. The APIs provide access price information which may be denoted in dollars or other currency units per megabyte gigabyte or other bandwidth quantity and metadata associated with the access being purchased. Various embodiments include the option to offer multiple tiers of service Gold Silver Bronze Guaranteed Bit Rate and the like which tiers of service may be offered for purchased at different pricing levels. The various embodiments also include a mechanism for the applications to purchase access using REST APIs as described herein.

Various embodiments apply a current applicable charging rate for any content sent by illustratively pre approved participants in the marketplace. No API need be exercised to make a purchase by the AP the AP identifies a price advertised in the API and makes an implicit purchase decision by sending content. For M2M devices all packets sent to the device on a cell are charged at the prevailing advertised rate for that cell. For regular subscriber devices a traffic detection function DPI could detect the sponsored content flow and trigger charging against the AP rather than the subscriber. Various embodiments use a third party access broker operating as intermediary between an access price determination and or offering mechanism and potential access purchasers.

Machine to machine M2M applications comprise illustratively applications such as automatic inventory control of remote vending machines numerous remote monitoring sensor applications automobile maintenance update applications firmware update applications for mobile devices and so on. These applications are typically flexible with respect to scheduling the delivery of content updates or other data to or from a remote device. As such where network access pricing is related to network congestion or utilization levels scheduling such delivery for low price congestion time periods may be achieved. In particular various embodiments of M2M data refresh delivery periodically monitor network access pricing levels and opportunistically schedule data refresh delivery in response to pricing levels dropping below a maximum threshold level. In this manner M2M costs may be controlled and possibly driven to levels sufficiently low to enable entire new classes of M2M systems or applications.

Within the context of various M2M solutions supported by the various embodiments wireless access is a component of a dedicated service. The wireless access is preferentially purchased below threshold trigger levels to opportunistically take advantage of drops in offered access pricing. In this manner M2M applications that have heretofore been impossible due to cost constraints may now be provided by M2M application vendors.

Sponsored content embodiments are where application or content service providers pay some or all of the costs of delivering the application or content to subscribers via a network.

In one embodiment special purpose devices such as electronic readers are used to deliver content to subscribers. For example an electronic book vendor may sell dedicated subscriber devices e readers that allow subscribers to sign up for the book delivery service where the electronic book vendor pays an access provider such as a wireless network owner to deliver content to the subscribers. Basic or minimum content only may be provided while access costs are high while rich content may require delivery when access costs are much lower.

In one embodiment a general purpose devices such as smart phones netbooks laptops or other computing devices are used to deliver content to subscribers. For example a streaming video vendor may provide rich media content to subscribers without requiring the subscribers to consume bandwidth from their wireless network provider. In particular streaming video vendor pays the wireless network owner to deliver the streaming media content to the subscribers. Even if the subscribers have an account with the wireless network owner the bandwidth required to stream the content is not counted against the allocated bandwidth associated with the subscriber account. The video vendor is thus motivated to stream content at a lower rate when the cost for access is high and may provide higher rate higher resolution video when the network is not congested and the access price cost paid by the video vendor is low. Similarly content providers may send static picture advertisements when access costs are high and stream video advertisements when access costs are low.

Various embodiments provide for content delivery or streaming at a guaranteed bit rate a bit rate associated with a particular quality of experience QoE tier a minimum bit rate a best efforts bit rate and so on where each of these delivery paradigms is associated with a determined price that changes in accordance with network conditions and other parameters.

Sponsored content may be further subsidized by including advertising with the delivered content. For example some embodiments contemplate reducing the price for access purchasers in exchange for the access purchasers presenting advertisements to their subscribers. Further price reductions may be provided where sufficient demographic information associated with the subscribers is provided such that the advertising may be well targeted or highly relevant to the subscriber.

As an example consider and add on feature associated with a subscription based sports network or other application content provider ACP . For flat monthly fee subscribers may access the ACP content via their home broadband connection such as cable television satellite television fiber to the curb and the like. For an additional monthly fee paid to the ACP subscribers may also access the ACP content via a wireless network on their smart phones tablet computers laptop peters and the like. Importantly a portion of the additional monthly fee paid to the ACP is used by the ACP to pay for access to the wireless network such that the monthly wireless network bandwidth allocation of the subscriber is not consumed by viewing the ACP content.

The mobile operator or wireless network owner publishes pricing tariffs and the like based on network conditions and or other factors as described herein. The ACP purchases access instantaneously or in a spot market fashion to satisfy subscriber demands for ACP content. In various embodiments ACP may purchase bulk access bandwidth from the mobile operator in anticipation of ACP subscriber demands.

In various embodiments the ACP responds to changes in wireless access tariff pricing by adapting one or more of the video rate or quality of content whether or not advertising is inserted into the content stream how many advertisements are inserted within the content stream whether or not the content stream itself is delayed until the tariff drops below a threshold level and so on. Various business modifications may be made by those skilled in the art and informed by the teachings of the present embodiments.

Specifically depicts a system including network including a plurality of eNodeBs serving wireless user equipment UE or user devices UD . The system may be configured similarly to the system described above with respect to .

At a first step step a network congestion monitoring element obtains network congestion information and provides the network congestion information to an intelligent presence element .

In various embodiments the network congestion monitoring element comprises an ALU 9900 Wireless Network Guardian WNG manufactured by Alcatel Lucent of Murray Hill N.J. The WNG provides cell level congestion information to support Analytics and real time service control functions. The WNG is a network vendor independent source of congestion information that AMP uses to determine pricing for access. In various embodiments network congestion information is derived directly from the various network elements within the cell the region including the cell and so on. Congestion information used to define access prices and tariffs may be from the network congestion monitoring element from various other network elements from the management system or from any combination thereof.

At a second step step the intelligent presence element calculates third party access pricing for each cell and adds metadata associated with the cells e.g. RAT UE state and the like formulates a pricing tariff or market offer and propagates the offer toward a marketing platform illustratively the Alcatel Lucent Open API Platform OAP . In various embodiments the network congestion information is combined metadata provided by an Alcatel Lucent Intelligence Presence InP server. The metadata includes illustratively information that is relevant to applications that may wish to purchase access and my include UE state battery charge processor occupancy etc. and access technology e.g. GPRS UMTS LTE etc. .

At a third step step the OAP exposes the formulated pricing tariff or market offer to application content providers ACPs and other entities via illustratively an application programming interface API . In various embodiments the pricing and metadata is securely exposed to the market place using RESTful APIs via the ALU Open API Platform OAP .

At a fourth step step the ACP purchases wireless access according to the exposed or offered tariff. In various embodiments an ACP entity such as a content server session manager or other functional element utilizes the RESTful APIs published via the Open API Platform OAP to effect an automated wireless access purchase transaction in response to illustratively a subscriber request for content received by the ACP.

For example assuming a particular ACP subscriber requests content from the ACP in a standard manner via the subscriber s UE the ACP identifies the requesting subscriber uses the metadata to identify the specific eNodeB servicing the subscriber and generates an access purchase request according to the tariff or pricing structure associated with the identified subscriber eNodeB. Note that the metadata may be supplied by the UE obtained from the network or dedicated location servers or other sources.

At a fifth step step the access purchase request is received from the ACP via the OAP and propagated toward a PCRF for proper charging and optionally to control or constrain QoS level via illustratively policy modifications and the like.

In various embodiments content delivered at peak expensive access times may be quality constrained with respect to content delivered at off peak inexpensive access times. For example various ACPs react in different ways to changes in pricing such as making access purchase decisions by altering their streaming video rate from high resolution to standard resolution and to low resolution in response to price changes. Different applications may set different price level trigger points for resolution or other QoS changes. Different applications may also set different advertising insertion policies such adapting by using video advertising using static advertising increasing or decreasing advertising insertion rates and so on in response to changes in access pricing.

These decisions may also take into account the relative value of the advertisement to the ACP versus the cost of presenting the advertisement to subscriber. It may be cheaper to provide content without advertising to a subscriber if the access cost of presenting the advertising to a subscriber exceeds the revenue associated with the advertising.

At a sixth step step the requested content is provided by the ACP to the user via the wireless network. In various embodiments an ACP server streams requested content to a packet Gateway PGW associated with the wireless network . Optionally advertisements received from illustratively an advertising server are periodically inserted into the stream content. The PGW receiving the content at the edge of the wireless network identifies the packets as sponsored application packets and identifies these packets as not to be counted against the bandwidth allocation associated with the subscriber.

At a seventh step step information is transmitted from the PGW to a charging OCS entity where the volume counted by the PGW for the various flows are rated for charging purposes so ACP and the subscriber can be charged appropriately.

The six pricing related trigger points and related policies for the first ACP A are shown below in Table 1 as follows 

The six pricing related trigger points and related policies for the second ACP B are shown below in Table 2 as follows 

The various embodiments advantageously provide an opportunity for service providers to increase revenue from application content providers while incentivizing more efficient utilization of the network infrastructure. In particular by shifting access costs to access purchasers having business relationships with network subscribers the cost associated with subscriber behavior such as bandwidth consumption may be more properly allocated among the various subscribers as well as among the various access purchasers.
