This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 529 747 filed Aug. 31 2011 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.

This disclosure relates to analyzing predicting and reducing customer churn. In particular this disclosure relates to analyzing customer experience determining customer churn and correlating customer experience with customer churn to predict and reduce future customer churn.

Customers may interact with service providers across a variety of channels including for example call centers retail stores web sites email social media and self service technology such as interactive voice response . A customer s experience through any one or any combination of these channels often affects the customer s overall satisfaction with the service provider. Customer satisfaction in turn determines whether the customer will look for alternative service providers or continue to stay with the current service provider. Because the cost of retaining customers is much lower than the cost of acquiring new customers service providers have a strong incentive to develop programs and incentives aimed at retaining customers. Service providers are constantly looking for effective tools to understand their customers improve customer retention rates reduce customer acquisition costs and boost market share. Not all customers have the same propensity to churn. By identifying customers who are most likely to churn service providers may reduce customer retention costs and develop customer retention programs and incentives that have the highest impact at the lowest cost.

Service providers need to be able to identify and address root causes of customer attrition and apply targeted treatment strategies to improve the customer experience. The root causes of customer churn can be hard to trace. The causes may lie virtually anywhere for example buried in negative experiences associated with any one of multiple interactions. In order to improve and sustain customer retention rates over time companies must improve the customer experience of all these interactions. But in enterprises where customers have millions of monthly interactions across a variety of channels it is difficult to identify all the interactions. It may be even more difficult to determine which interactions drive churn especially when customer interaction data records are usually contained in different systems that do not communicate with one another and are collected in varying data formats.

In today s highly competitive market customers do not hesitate to switch providers to find the most competitive pricing the best value for their money and high quality service. The development of social media as the ultimate word of mouth communication has greatly increased the speed and magnitude of influence of individual switching decisions. In other words one customer s decision to switch providers may influence more customers and more quickly through today s many channels of social media. Moreover in many industries customers perceive very few barriers to switching in their constant quest for differentiated offerings.

A churn analysis system collects cross channel customer experience data correlates cross channel customer experience data with customer churn and determines a customer s propensity to churn based on the correlations. The system collects customer interaction data for each customer interaction between an individual customer and a service provider. The system tracks churn data such as date and time of churn for the individual customer and creates customer experience blocks from the customer interaction data. The system further stores the customer experience blocks in unified service analytic records and determines correlations between customer churn and customer interaction data. Based on the correlations the system determines customer propensity to churn based on the customer s interaction data. The system may measure propensity to churn as for example a Customer Churn Index CCI . In this way the system predicts the customer s propensity to churn before the churn occurs and identifies opportunities for retaining customers. Using the propensity to churn measure a service provider may monitor an average or total customer churn rate to determine effectiveness of churn reduction initiatives.

Other systems methods features and advantages will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems methods features and advantages be included within this description be within the scope of the invention and be protected by the following claims.

A USAR may be a cross channel customer experience data model that provides an end to end view of customers experiences with a service provider. Customer experiences may include customer contacts interactions transactions or other involvements with a service provider. The USAR may logically integrate data from disparate sources with clear relationships and intuitive ability to navigate. The USAR may integrate data from multiple systems into one environment. The USAR may enable determination of causal data from business results without multiple iterations of reporting requests dramatically reducing the time required to research the true why of business results. The USAR may include cost data analysis which may enable initiative prioritization based on true understanding of overall impact and costs e.g. cost to serve churn etc. . The USAR may integrate cross channel data to provide a centralized customer experience intelligence platform. The USAR may be a scaling and efficient solution to implement a customer churn index across an entire customer base which will provide capability to automate a customer score basis.

The USAR may be a collection of one or more customer experience blocks. A customer experience block may include a group of customer interaction data ordered chronologically. Each customer experience block may include a plurality of attributes describing the customer experience block and a plurality of attributes describing each of the customer interactions within the customer experience block.

Voluntary churn C may be a function of Product Quality Q Price Sensitivity P and Customer Experience E C f Q P E . The churn analysis system may employ a data driven discovery approach to gain intelligence on customer pain points or dissatisfaction in their interactions with the service provider and prioritize hypotheses for pilots. Pilots may be for example proposed programs or initiatives designed to increase customer retention or decrease churn. Pilots may be based for example on hypotheses regarding the effects of customer contacts and interactions on overall customer experience and customer propensity to churn. The system may also provide ongoing churn intelligence support to measure the effectiveness of pilots and their specific effects on voluntary churn and customer experience.

For example an internet service provider may look at historical data regarding customer calls to a customer service call center to resolve internet connectivity issues. Based on the historical data the internet service provider may determine on average that if a customer does not call back within 7 days regarding the same issue the issue has been resolved. Thus the internet service provider may determine that an issue may be considered resolved if a customer does not call back within a resolution threshold such as 7 days of a previous call. Then the internet service provider may set the maximum contact intensity X to the resolution threshold of 7 days or 168 hours.

Where the resolution threshold is determined as the maximum contact intensity a Corollary of Maximum Intensity may be derived such that every consecutive interaction within a customer experience block is within X hours from each other chronologically or reverse chronologically.

Continuing with the example in customer experience block has three interactions with a customer identified as CCCCCCC an interaction on 9 Jan. 2011 which was a first contact and unresolved contact an interaction on 12 Jan. 2011 which was a repeat contact and unresolved contact and an interaction on 17 Jan. 2011 which was a repeat contact and resolved contact.

Customer experience blocks may be further described as follows. A customer experience block is considered open if at a current point in time the block does not end with a resolved contact. A customer experience block is considered closed if at a current point in time the block ends with a resolved contact. A repeat customer experience block is a customer experience block with more than one contact. A first contact resolved customer experience block is a closed customer experience block with only one contact. For example in customer experience block is a first contact resolved customer experience block.

The churn analysis system may include a churn prediction model that has predictive and analytic capabilities. The system may use statistical tools to develop predictive models that examine and uncover relationships between historical customer data channels of interaction and customer experience block level attributes imbedded in churned and current customer segments.

The churn analysis system may create the churn prediction model based on USAR attributes and USAR derived metrics including interaction metrics and block metrics. For example a USAR may include a plurality of unique customer experience blocks and each customer experience block may include a plurality of unique customer interactions. USAR attributes may include properties of interactions properties of blocks data elements that are captured from customer interactions and or metrics that are calculated or derived from the properties and or data elements.

Attributes may be numeric or alphanumeric whereas metrics are generally measureable values. The churn analysis system may calculate an interaction metric for each unique interaction e.g. session time independent of the other interactions in the customer experience block. A block metric may relate to all interactions in the customer experience block e.g. number of interactions in block .

Interaction attributes and metrics may include for example Row Index a unique key for every interaction in the USAR Channel a flag value indicating the native channel of the interaction for example R retail T Technical Support Session Time calculated as a period of time equal to the end time of the interaction generally a transaction or case session end time minus the start time of the interaction generally a transaction or case session start time Adjusted Session Time calculated using the same logic as Session Time but the end time portion is adjusted to account for any transactions or sessions where the end time is inaccurately captured e.g. an agent doesn t promptly close a session after a call and when a subsequent transaction or session is handled by the same agent and the start time of the subsequent transaction or session is before the end time of the current session the end time of the current session is adjusted to equal the start time of the subsequent transaction or session Date Key calculated as a numeric value based on the start time of the interaction e.g. Jan. 5 2011 would be represented as 01052011 Month Key calculated as a numeric value based on the start time of the interaction e.g. Jan. 5 2011 would be represented as 012011 Churn 30 Day Flag a 1 0 flag indicating if the customer churned from the company within 30 days of the start time of the interaction and Churn 60 Day Flag a 1 0 flag indicating if the customer churned from the company within 60 days of the start time of the interaction .

Block attributes and metrics may include for example Block Index a unique key for every customer interaction block in the USAR First Interaction Flag a 1 0 flag indicating if the interaction is the first interaction in the block first interaction being defined as any interaction where there is no previous interaction from the same customer within X days Resolved Flag a 1 0 flag indicating if the interaction is the last interaction in the block last interaction being defined as any interaction where there is no subsequent interaction from the same customer within X days Interaction Sequence Number number indicating the location of the current interaction within the block e.g. for a four interaction block the first interaction would be indicated by 1 the second would be indicated by 2 and so on Time to Next Interaction the amount of time until the next interaction in the block Time Since Previous Interaction the amount of time since the previous interaction in the block Next Interaction Reason the interaction reason for the next interaction in the block Previous Interaction Reason the interaction reason for the previous interaction in the block Agents In Block the total number of distinct agents or employees involved in the block of interactions Agent Ownership Flag a 1 0 flag indicating if all the interactions in the block were handled by the same agent or the same employee for cross channel blocks this will generally be 0 which indicates No Transferred Flag a 1 0 flag indicating if the interaction resulted in a transfer calculated as a subsequent interaction in the same channel with a start time within five minutes of the end time of the current interaction Interactions Per Block the count of the total number of interactions in the block Minutes Per Block calculated as the sum number of minutes from sessions time or adjusted session time for all interactions in the block Days Per Block the number of days between the start date of the first interaction in the block and end date of the last interaction in the block Block Path depicts the path the customer went through in the block of interactions e.g. if the block consists of four interactions first Retail then Technical Support then back to Retail twice the Block Path would be RTRR Channels In Block counts the number of unique channels the customer touched in the block and Average Intensity calculated as the average time between each interaction in the block .

Attributes and metrics may vary depending on the channel of interaction industry of the service provider or business objectives. For example if a customer calls a customer service call center the service provider may track the start and end time of the call the reason for the call and the identity of the customer service representative who handles the call. If a customer purchases or exchanges a mobile phone at a retail store the retail store may track the date and time of the transaction a description of any purchased or exchanged devices and the store number and sales representative who serviced the customer.

The following tables show examples of USAR attributes that the system may process. The system may process additional fewer or different attributes in other implementations.

As shown in the system may create a second dataset that includes the row index value for all first contact interaction records from the first dataset. The system may label the row index values as row index start in the second dataset and sort the values from smallest to largest. Then the system may assign a block index value for each row index start beginning with 1 for the smallest row index start and ending with M where M equals the total number of records or first contact interaction records in the second dataset. The system may also assign a row index end value to each record in the second dataset where the row index end value is defined as the minimum row index for all resolved contacts from the first dataset that is greater or equal to the row index start value of the record in the second dataset. Then the system may assign a block index value from the second dataset to each record in the first dataset where the row index value is between the row index start value and row index end value in the second dataset . For example in a block index value of 1 from the second dataset is assigned to all records in the first dataset that have a row index value of 1 or 2.

In step data analysis may comprise collecting data regarding cross channel interactions and attributes from a USAR segmenting churn pockets classifying customers by binary assignments such as 1 for churned customers and 0 for current customers and determining cross channel USAR metrics related to customers subscribers blocks channels or interactions. The metrics may include for example Agents Per Call Agents Per Resolution Contacts Per Resolution and or Time Per Resolution. The data collected from the USAR may vary depending on business objectives and channels of interaction. Segmenting churn pockets may comprise identifying a combination of one or more block attributes or interaction attributes which when analyzed together correlate with a particularly high or low churn rate. The churn analysis system may segment churn pockets according to other metrics or attributes disclosed or any other metrics or attributes that may be relevant to churn analysis. The churn analysis system may derive or calculate metrics such as cross channel USAR metrics from interactions that occur through more than one channel of interaction.

The data analysis of step may provide understanding of business problems and enable conversion of problems into statistical analysis. For example step may provide an understanding of subscriber level churn drivers interaction level churn drivers and block level churn drivers. Subscriber level churn drivers may include for example subscriber attributes such as the subscriber s age income level geographic location or marriage status. Interaction level and block level churn drivers may include for example interaction attributes as shown in the tables above and below.

In step exploratory analysis may comprise correlation analysis and factor analysis. This step may comprise analyzing based on historical data channel specific attribute correlations cross channel attribute correlations channel specific attribute principle components and cross channel attribute components. Channel specific attribute correlation analysis may comprise determining whether independent channel specific attributes affect churn rate. Examples of channel specific attributes may include number of visits to a store per block for retail store interactions number of calls per block for a technical support call center or number of views per page for website interactions . The system may determine for example that the number of calls per block has a positive correlation with churn rate. The system may utilize a statistical analysis software program such as SPSS to determine correlations for each attribute. Cross channel attribute correlation analysis may similarly comprise determining whether independent cross channel attributes such as number of interactions per block or number of agents per block affect churn rate.

Channel specific attribute principle component analysis may comprise determining the relative weight of each channel specific attribute with respect to its effect on churn rate. In other words this analysis may include comparing the effect of one channel specific attribute to the effect of another channel specific attribute and determining which attribute has a greater effect on churn rate. The system may use a statistical analysis software program to determine the relative effect or the appropriate weight of each channel specific attribute.

Cross channel attribute component analysis may comprise determining the relative weight of each cross channel attribute with respect to its effect on churn rate. In other words this analysis may include comparing the effect of one cross channel attribute to the effect of another cross channel attribute and determining which attribute has a greater effect on churn rate. The system may use a statistical analysis software program to determine the relative effect or the appropriate weight of each cross channel attribute.

In step confirmatory analysis may comprise using logistic regression or Cox regression to confirm the correlations determined in step . Logistic regression may comprise classifying customers as churned or current customers extracting data for a statistically representative sample of customers to be used as a test population e.g. 20 of population of churned and current subscribers extracting data for a statistically representative sample of customers to be used as a control population e.g. 20 of population of churned and current subscribers using USAR metrics as independent variables to predict subscriber churning status 1 or 0 as a dependent variable performing analyses to create a best fit equation with coefficients or independent variables explaining customer churn or dependent variables verifying that the coefficients meet significance criteria which may be 0.5 or another value determined from the type of regression used verifying that the overall model diagnostics and statistics are within acceptance criteria which may be subjective to the sample and nature of data. As an example a dependent variable when predicted will give an outcome of 0 or 1 representative of subscriber classification. As another example a best fit equation when created will classify a subscriber as 1 or 0 based on the interaction and relationship with the independent variables or metrics. The churn analysis system may use logistic regression to predict future classification of subscribers based on the cross channel experience attributes.

In step model testing may comprise testing a model for accuracy and calibrating the model which helps to ensure that the model effectively predicts customer propensity to churn or other statistics of interest to a service provider. Key criteria are evaluated to create a measure of competency and accuracy. For example the system may use a Likelihood Ratio Test to test for overall model fit at a levered significance of 0.05. Additionally or alternatively the system may use a Wald Test to test for the relationship between experience attributes e.g. time to resolution and the churn outcome at a levered significance of 0.05 or a Score Test to test for acceptance of a variable into the churn model. The system may also perform residual testing and variance analysis to test a model for accuracy and to calibrate the model. Block level metrics may be used in the correlation regression and churn propensity score development.

In step refitting or model scoring involves iterations of implementing changes and influences from the model testing step to ensure model accuracy. Overall this step predicts classification of customers as future churners or not. Churners are classified as 1 and current customers as 0. The churn analysis system may apply a best fit equation to experience attributes in the form of for example Log P 1 P Constant B x1 B2 x2 . . . Bz xz where P is a value between 0 and 1 representing the log odds ratio of churning and B B2 . . . Bz are coefficients of the metrics. The churn analysis system may apply metrics including block metrics and interaction metrics from the control population to the equation to determine whether the equation accurately classifies subscriber status. Then the system may run analysis to create a best fit equation with coefficients explanatory of customer status based on experience attributes. As an example the dependent variable when predicted may give an outcome of 0 or 1 representative of customer classification. As another example the dependent variable when predicted will give a log odds ratio between 0 and 1 as subscriber classification. Finally normalizing all CCI scores from the customer base may create quartile estimates of customers at risk of churning. Model scoring may further comprise block analysis random sample generation testing subset designs e.g. creating churn and active groups for testing and trending correlation analysis identify verify and refine experience drivers hypotheses development identify initial drivers for testing regression analysis validating drivers thru initial robust response analysis and model evaluation residual analysis and model testing .

The churn prediction model may provide a method for evaluating a customer s propensity to churn by deriving a customer churn index CCI through a statistical equation. The model may comprise an optimized equation that assigns a CCI score to each individual customer where the CCI score reflects causative interactions between churn and historical data and may also reflect churn propensity. The churn prediction model may comprise for example a linear equation created by analyzing a combination of variables representing customer channel and experience attributes. The churn analysis system may use the linear equation to assign a CCI score between 0 and 1 a churn propensity scale where 0 and 1 are least and highest churn risks respectively to each customer. The CCI score for an individual customer shows how the factors that affect the customer s decision to churn combine to create a greater or lesser churn propensity.

The CCI scores for individual customers may also be accumulated averaged and otherwise manipulated to reveal trends in the behavior of individual customers and groups of customers. This may enable a service provider for example to predict which customer or group of customers has a high propensity to churn. The churn analysis system may examine causative relationships underlying the predictive model to determine which attributes drive the highest CCI scores. This may provide a more targeted ownership process to addressing issues of churn.

The churn analysis system may provide customer service representatives with an individual customer s CCI score while speaking with the customer. This may alert the representative of customers with high CCI scores and allow the customer service representative to respond more appropriately to prevent the customer from churning.

The composite of CCIs for an entire population of customers may provide a method for determining the propensity to churn for the entire customer base. Therefore an enterprise wide CCI can provide a good measure of the overall health and effectiveness of churn prevention activities.

In an example of an implementation of the system and methods disclosed a user may use the system to perform an iterative process of identifying prioritizing and testing hypotheses. A user may use the system to perform multiple analyses to identify churn reduction opportunities at a telecommunications service provider Telco including identification of major device issues as shown in discussed in more detail below channel ping pong analysis as shown in discussed in more detail below agent ownership analysis as shown in discussed in more detail below and early device education experience as shown in discussed in more detail below .

Graphs and indicate that customers who are offered who accept and or who actually receive device education are less likely to churn. Based on these results a service provider may develop a pilot to offer and provide customers with device education.

A device education pilot may include for example branding the customer experience and defining separate experiences for a unique set of customers. Device education may include for example instructions or assistance with device set up and device operations. Basic device set up education may include data and voice provisioning and validation contacts transfer and email set up. Advanced device setup education may include basic device set up education and SW updates and or social network apps set up. Device operation education may include instructions or assistance with device operation. Basic device operation education may include ensuring that a customer knows how to make calls and check voice mail and email. Consultative device operation education may include basic device operation education and an overview of device options. Heavy device operation education may include basic device operation education and a walk through of how to maximize device performance triage device difference how to Get more out of your device and self help options.

The channels through which device education may be provided may vary or may be customized based on a customer s level of knowledge and experience with respect to device set up and device operation. The pilot may also offer remote access set up alternatively or in addition to device education. Device education may be provided for example through flyers or other printed materials emails web application instant messages or websites. Implementation of the pilot may include for example training and branding agents as device education experts implementation of performance management initiatives and completing customer surveys to monitor branding device education offer rate and device education acceptance. Customer surveys may be provided through SMS websites social media or other channels of interaction.

The system may use a USAR to create a prioritization model based principle factors to measure cost of a failure point where resolution was not achieved. Three factors may include for example Customer Satisfaction Customer Sensitivity and Impact Cost of Resolution. The prioritization model may continuously gauge the health of a customer retention program based on identifying which customers are satisfied which customers are motivated to respond to a survey and where a business fails to resolve a customer s issue. The system may use these measures to gauge customer pain or dissatisfaction and prioritize opportunities for transformation. The opportunities may include areas where customers are dissatisfied highly motivated to respond to an experience or interaction and the impact and or cost is high.

In another example of an implementation of a churn analysis system the system may use a USAR to evaluate the efficacy of a major desktop tool utilized by front end technical support call center agents for troubleshooting issues. The evaluation may involve determining information such as major inefficiencies in Average Handling Time and overall Minutes Per Resolution when the tool was used versus when the tool was not used for similar issues on calls. The system may analyze this information to establish a direct correlation of the tool usage rate to additional dispatches escalations. Next the system may complete an evaluation of the benefits for each call driver issue type within the call center and make precise recommendations as to which drivers the agents should continue usage of the tool and which drivers the agents should discontinue usage. The recommendation may be based on a balanced evaluation of costs both within and outside the call center as well as customer satisfaction.

In another example Event Based Tracking Analysis in the USAR may enable a user to plan for several events occurring in the business and their effects on the Client s Customer Care Operation such as Availability and Cost to Serve. The system may utilize the USAR to help determine precise impact at the issue level of areas affected by a major process shift imposed by the service provider. The system may create predictive models to pinpoint the effect of the process change on the entire network. Further analysis may prove large scale impacts of this process change to several contractual metrics despite popular held beliefs to the contrary. Operation adjusted demand models may ensure availability of customer service representatives despite increased demand on their time given network changes.

In another example of an implementation the system may perform frequent caller analysis. The system may use a USAR to develop a business case for a solution to handle Frequent Callers improving customer experience and resolution rate for dissatisfied customers. In analysis the system may use the USAR to identify customers who called in frequently to a contact center within a service provider specific criteria of frequency and time. The USAR may enumerate the impacts to Customer Satisfaction Minutes into the center and Customer Retention levels based on case analysis on the calls generated by frequent callers. The findings from the analysis may result in a business case for an initiative allowing the service provider to benefit from a substantial savings per annum. An example of such initiative may be to create a specialized queue to enhance the customer experience for the most painful customers. Continued benefits in the Run Phase or continued utilization of the USAR may include for example Resolution Analysis by issue type allowed for detailed targeting and training of the queue on drivers where frontline agents typically struggle and continued tracking of progress on an initiative and setting targets in order to reward agent performance.

In another exemplary implementation the system may perform Repeat Calls and Dispatch Analysis. shows an exemplary graph which the system may generate or provide for determining a correlation between interaction problem codes and customer satisfaction level and repeat call rates. Horizontal axis represents a customer satisfaction level increasing from left to right. Line indicates a service provider s Network repeat call rate. Vertical axis represents a repeat call rate increasing from bottom upwards. Line indicates the service provider s target customer satisfaction level. The points in the graph represent different problem codes and and the location of the points indicate the repeat call rate and customer satisfaction level associated with each problem codes. For example the graph indicates that problem code is associated with a repeat call rate that is slightly below the network repeat call rate but also associated with a customer satisfaction level that is significantly below the target customer satisfaction level. Problem code is associated with the highest repeat call rate out of all five problem codes and also the lowest customer satisfaction level.

Displaying data from a USAR in a graph may help identify large scale inefficiencies with dispatch processes and associated repeat calls revealing large negative impacts on the customer experience. A main analysis may show a disproportionate number of repeat calls associated with a particular approach to resolving customers problems. An analysis of customer satisfaction surveys may show significant disconnect between contact centers and field organizations and overall poor performance in a number of key indicators such as repeat rate. A time series analysis performed with external data may reveal a majority of repeat calls on the day of a scheduled dispatch mostly resulting in missed appointments and inflexibility of scheduling from a customer perspective. These analyses may identify significant savings in decreasing repeat minutes minutes spent on repeat interactions which may result in a dedicated Transformation work stream with various process and technology changes to realize internal and external savings to the call center and customer care enterprise at large from repeat minutes and non productive dispatches.

The churn analysis system may also be implemented for example in a Process Pilot Study as shown in of an Agent Process Call Flow Study. The system may track report and evaluate all processes related to call handling and troubleshooting. The USAR may track agent data and evaluate agent performance between test and control groups. Through analysis targeted and specific agent segments may be identified for which pilot processes are more effective in terms of Average Handling Time First Call Resolution Average Minutes Per Resolution Customer Satisfaction. The system may complete an analysis of variance for each process based on core KPIs. The system may analyze KPIs by problem code to determine call drivers that contribute most to the overall metrics impact. The system may provide recommendations on identifying drivers where a pilot process should be adhered to strictly and those drivers where strict adherence should not be required. The system may present to the user a full analytical review including a number of submitted process changes and the user may determine based on the analysis presented which changes to implement.

The systems and methods disclosed may also be implemented for example in an analysis and transformation effort on email issues into tech support to quantify customer pain in the email issue and handling experience for an ISP. The USAR may track and enumerate repeat call rates and service induced churn. The system may determine whether email problem codes generate a high number of repeat minutes when the first call did not solve the issue which result in high costs to the service provider. The system may compare the propensity to churn for chronic email callers with the propensity to churn for non chronic email callers. Based on that comparison the system may make recommend a solution such as a remote email task force within tech support to deliver specialized skills on email issues to customers.

The following table shows metrics that the system may use to monitor customer experience and effectiveness of pilots. The system may process fewer additional or alternative metrics in other implementations.

In a networked deployment the computer system may operate in the capacity of a server or as a client user computer in a server client user network environment or as a peer computer system in a peer to peer or distributed network environment. The computer system may also be implemented as or incorporated into various devices such as a personal computer PC a tablet PC a set top box STB a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile device a palmtop computer a laptop computer a desktop computer a communications device or any other machine capable of executing churn analysis logic that specifies actions to be taken by that machine.
