This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT JP2012 077372 filed Oct. 23 2012 claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 249949 filed Nov. 15 2011 the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to a compound for copper patterning useful in the fields of electronics and the like as well as copper patterns formed with the same and a method of producing the same.

Techniques have recently been attracting attention for printing such as ink jet or screen printing with a metallic ink on a flexible plastic substrate followed by sintering to form desired conductive patterns. The metallic ink used here is desired to sinter at lower temperatures below the heat resistance temperature of the plastic substrate. As such metallic inks for conductive patterning silver or copper containing inks that are sintering at lower temperatures have widely been developed. Among them copper has advantages over silver for its more excellent electrical characteristics and lower price.

As the inks for copper patterning there are known inks in which copper carboxylate is used as the copper material Non patent Publications 1 and 2 and in which copper fine particles are dispersed Patent Publications 1 and 2 . Since copper is prone to oxidation sintering of such inks is often performed in a reducing atmosphere such as of hydrogen or formic acid which causes safety problems in industrialization. In addition the sintering temperature is as high as 250 C. or higher and thus can be applied to only some types of plastic substrates.

In order to solve these problems there are proposed inks achieving low temperature sintering such as the one disclosed in Non patent Publication 3 which is composed of copper formate amine and a solvent. This ink is made into a copper pattern by sintering at 120 to 160 C. in nitrogen atmosphere. However sintering of such conventional copper ink which contains an organic copper compound or copper fine particles as a copper material may result in shrinkage of the printed film and the sintered pattern may be different from the desired as printed pattern.

On the other hand it has been reported that materials containing organic components which decompose and vaporize at lower temperatures are useful in inks such as those on plastic substrates which need to be sintered at lower temperatures. As such compounds silver ketocarboxylate compounds are known which are reported to be capable of silver patterning at lower temperatures Patent Publication 3 .

As a corresponding copper compound exhibiting similar decomposition mechanism a copper ketocarboxylate compound may be envisaged. Copper ketocarboxylate compounds have been studied over a long time and used as a polymerization catalyst or a silver reducing agent Patent Publication 4 Non patent Publications 4 and 5 .

However these compounds have never been used as a material for copper patterning partly because copper is more prone to oxidation than silver and conductive copper patterns cannot be obtained by techniques similar to those for the silver ketocarboxylate compounds.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition for copper patterning which is excellently safe in copper patterning sintering at lower temperatures and capable of forming a highly conductive copper pattern of a desired shape even on a plastic substrate.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of copper patterning that produces with excellent safety a copper pattern of a desired shape with high conductivity by low temperature sintering at a good yield even on a plastic substrate.

It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a copper pattern having a desired shape and a high conductivity.

Into a NaOH aqueous solution 2.30 g 24.0 mL for hydrolysis 6.24 g 48.0 mmol of ethyl acetoacetate was added and stirred under heating at 30 C. for 3 hours. After the three hours the reaction mixture was cooled down to 0 C. and a 5 N HNOaqueous solution was added thereto to make the reaction liquid acidic. To the reaction mixture 2.90 g 4.80 mmol of a copper II nitrate aqueous solution was added dropwise and subjected to magnetic stirring for 4 hours. The precipitated solid was taken out by filtration and washed with ion exchanged water and acetone to obtain 2.05 g 6.70 mmol of copper II acetoacetate dihydrate in the form of light blue solid.

Into a NaOH aqueous solution 3.46 g 24.0 mL for hydrolysis 11.4 g 72.0 mmol of ethyl butyrylacetate was added and stirred under heating at 30 C. for 3 hours. After the three hours the reaction mixture was cooled down to 0 C. and a 5 N HNOaqueous solution as added thereto to make the reaction liquid acidic. To the reaction mixture 4.34 g 7.20 mmol of a copper II nitrate aqueous solution was added dropwise and subjected to magnetic stirring for 3 hours. The precipitated solid was taken out by filtration and washed with ion exchanged water and acetone to obtain 4.37 g 12.2 mmol of copper II butyrylacetate dihydrate in the form of blue solid.

Into a NaOH aqueous solution 3.46 g 24.0 mL for hydrolysis 10.4 g 72.0 mmol of ethyl 2 methylacetoacetate was added and stirred under heating at 30 C. for 3 hours. After the three hours the reaction mixture was cooled down to 0 C. and a 5 N HNOaqueous solution was added thereto to make the reaction liquid acidic. To the reaction mixture 4.34 g 7.20 mmol of copper II nitrate aqueous solution was added dropwise and subjected to magnetic stirring for 3 hours. The precipitated solid was taken out by filtration and washed with ion exchanged water and acetone to obtain 2.81 g 8.52 mmol of copper II 2 methylacetoacetate dihydrate in the form of blue solid.

Compositions for copper patterning were prepared at the compositional ratios shown in Table 1. As the copper fine particles indicated in the table copper fine particles manufactured by NISSHIN ENGINEERING INC. D 81.0 nm surface oxide film about 2 nm were used. In the table SFCP 200A SFCP 10AX and SFCP 500A refer to copper fine particles under the trade names SFCP 200A D 126 nm without dispersant SFCP 10AX D 48.2 nm with dispersant and SFCP 500A D 545 nm without dispersant respectively all manufactured by FUKUDA METAL FOIL POWDER CO. LTD. In Example 1 30 two kinds of copper fine particles were mixed in use. Dindicates the particle size calculated by the BET method.

Under the conditions shown in Table 3 each of the compositions prepared in Examples 1 1 to 1 30 was applied with a bar coater to a substrate of various kinds slide glass referred to as glass hereinbelow polyimide abbreviated as PI hereinbelow polyethylene naphthalate abbreviated as PEN hereinbelow or polyethylene terephthalate abbreviated as PET hereinbelow to prepare a film of 30 mm 50 mm. Next the films were sintered at the sintering temperatures in the atmospheres shown in Table 3 in a heating furnace SMT SCOPE manufactured by SANYO SEIKO KABUSHIKI KAISHA for 20 minutes to obtain copper patterns solid films having a film thickness of 1 m. The nitrogen atmosphere was established by flowing nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 1 L min in the heating furnace.

Each of the copper patterns was evaluated for volume resistivity and shrinkage. The results are shown in Table 3. The volume resistivity was measured with a four point probe method trade name LORESTA GP manufactured by MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL CORPORATION . The shrinkage was evaluated with respect to the area of the film of the composition for copper patterning and the films of which shrinkage in area after sintering was not higher than 5 were indicated as GOOD and those of higher than 5 as BAD with the measured values in parenthesis.

From Table 3 it is seen that the copper patterns obtained by the methods of Examples 2 1 to 2 24 had volume resistivities of 4.7 to 59.1 cm and may be used as conductive bodies. Further these copper patterns exhibited little shrinkage after sintering and thus may be formed into desired shapes by various printing processes.

It is also seen that the copper patterns obtained in Examples 2 25 to 2 35 from the compositions for copper patterning containing copper fine particles had volume resistivities of 7.3 to 802.4 cm and may thus be used as conductive bodies and exhibited little shrinkage after sintering and thus may be formed into desired shapes by various printing processes.

Copper patterns solid films were produced using the compositions prepared in Examples 1 5 and Comparative Examples 1 1 to 1 6 under the conditions shown in Table 4 in the same way as in Example 2.

The evaluations of the volume resistivity and shrinkage were carried out in the same way as in Example 2. The results are shown in Table 4. The copper patterns which had high volume resistivities of 1 10 cm or higher and could not be used as conductive bodies were not evaluated for shrinkage.

From Table 4 it is seen that the copper patterns obtained in Comparative Examples 2 1 and 2 2 exhibited shrinkage of not less than 5 upon sintering so that when desired films were formed by printing or the like process the desired patterns could not be obtained due to shrinkage after sintering. It is also seen that the copper patterns obtained in Comparative Examples 2 3 to 2 8 had high volume resistivities of 1 10 cm or higher and thus could not be used as conducive bodies.

Ink jet printing was carried out using the composition for copper patterning prepared in Example 1 13. As an ink jet printer DMP 2831 Dimatix Fujifilm Ink USA was used and as an ink jet cartridge DMC 11610 Dimatix Fujifilm Ink USA was used. A film in a line pattern of 2 mm 20 mm was produced on PI under the ejection conditions of a frequency of 5 kHz voltage of 18 V and a cartridge temperature of 60 C. with the distance of 1 mm between the cartridge head and the substrate and the dot spacing of 20 m. Then the film was sintered at 200 C. for 20 minutes in an nitrogen atmosphere in a heating furnace SMT SCOPE manufactured by SANYO SEIKO KABUSHIKI KAISHA to produce a copper pattern line pattern . The nitrogen atmosphere was established by flowing nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 1 L min in the heating furnace.

The volume resistivity of the obtained copper pattern was measured in the same way as in Example 2 1 and found to be 6.5 cm. No breaking by shrinkage was observed.

Ink jet printing was carried out in the same way as in Example 3 except that the composition for copper patterning prepared in Example 1 13 was replaced with the composition for copper patterning prepared in Comparative Example 1 1 and the resulting coated film was sintered to obtain a copper pattern line pattern .

The obtained copper pattern was observed to have breaking due to shrinkage which made it impossible to measure the volume resistivity.

Dispenser printing was carried out using each of the compositions for copper patterning prepared in Examples 1 5 1 24 1 25 and 1 28. As a dispenser printer SHOT mini ML 606GX manufactured by MUSASHI ENGINEERING CO. LTD. was used with the needle diameter of 0.1 mm and the distance of 0.1 mm between the dispenser head and the substrate to produce a film in a line pattern of 30 mm long on a PI substrate. The film thickness was controlled by regulating the discharge pressure so that the sintered film thickness was 1 m. The sintering was carried out at 200 C. for 20 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere in a heating furnace SMT SCOPE manufactured by SANYO SEIKO KABUSHIKI KAISHA to obtain a copper pattern line pattern . The nitrogen atmosphere was established by flowing nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 1 L min in the heating furnace.

From Table 5 it is seen that in Examples 4 2 to 4 4 wherein the copper concentration and the viscosity of the compositions for copper patterning were high due to the addition of copper fine particles the wetting of the line patterns were inhibited and the lines could be made thinner even in the production of patterns of the same film thickness. Incidentally all the copper patterns had volume resistivities on the order of 10 cm or lower and the conductivity was maintained.
