title: Structured document customizable comparison systems and methods
abstract: Multiple structured documents can be compared with one another utilizing user-specified custom configurations. For example, a traversal of at least two of the documents may identify one or more potential matches in the documents. A user-defined rule may be obtained that specifies differences that are expected within the documents. Additionally, a determination may be made regarding when differences between potential matches are significant based in part on user-defined rule. In some examples, significant differences may be determined to be significant as a result of being differences, other than expected differences, that vary from the expected differences. Any significant differences can be logged, reported on or added to statistics for the new service being tested.
