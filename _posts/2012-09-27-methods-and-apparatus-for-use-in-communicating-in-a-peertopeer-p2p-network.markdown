title: Methods and apparatus for use in communicating in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network
abstract: Techniques for use in a wireless device which is configured to operate as a group owner (GO) in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network are described. The group owner sends a first multicast message to one or more first P2P devices in the P2P network. The first multicast message includes first notice of absence (NoA) data. The group owner also sends a second multicast message to one or more second P2P devices in the P2P network. The second multicast message includes second NoA data. Partitioning in the P2P network in this fashion may be set based on the different types of communications established with the P2P devices (e.g. different traffic classes or Quality of Service (QoS) types).

The present disclosure relates generally to communication devices configured for wireless communications such as IEEE 802.11 based communications including techniques for use in communicating in a peer to peer P2P network.

A wireless communication device such as a portable wireless telephony device or smartphone may be configured to communicate in wireless communication networks. For example such a device may communicate via access points APs of wireless local area networks WLANs in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards or the like. Such devices may also communicate using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device.

Techniques for use in a wireless device which is configured to operate as a group owner GO in a peer to peer P2P network are described herein. The group owner sends a first multicast message to one or more first P2P devices in the P2P network. The first multicast message includes first notice of absence NoA data. The group owner also sends a second multicast message to one or more second P2P devices in the P2P network. The second multicast message includes second NoA data. Partitioning in the P2P network in this fashion is set based on the different types of communications established with the P2P devices e.g. different traffic classes or Quality of Service QoS types .

To illustrate one environment within which the techniques of the present disclosure may be practiced illustrates a wireless communication device which may communicate in a communication system . In the communication system wireless device may communicate with one or more wireless communication networks. For example wireless device may communicate with a wireless communication network which is a wireless local area network WLAN . Here wireless network and wireless device may operate in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards.

In this example wireless network has a plurality of wireless access points APs and for wireless communications with wireless device . WLANs may be identified by a wireless device with use of a wireless network identifier which is communicated from the WLAN. The wireless network identifier may be for example a Set Service Identifier SSID or Extended SSID ESSID . In this example wireless network includes one or more servers a redirect server and a gateway . Server may provide data applications and or functionality for communication services for wireless device .

Wireless network may be a public Wi Fi hotspot for public use and include what may be referred to as a captive portal or walled garden. For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway is configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality as well as to permit or deny external access outside of wireless network to Internet . To do this gateway has a set of IP address filters which define a set of addresses that are permissible impermissible if any at all for access by devices. Access by a device depends on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization.

Typically when a request by a device in wireless network is made prior to proper authorization gateway is configured to redirect the request to redirect server . In response redirect server is configured to respond to wireless device to provide data for producing information e.g. Web page information which is rendered in a visual display of wireless device via a Web browser application. The information may solicit a user response. For example the information may solicit a user registration or login with user fields for entering a user name and or password information. Gateway identifies whether the received user response is sufficient e.g. whether the user name and password match prestored user name and password information whether the user payment is accepted whether the user acceptance is confirmed etc. . If the user response is deemed sufficient gateway permits access to the data applications and or functionality in or outside of wireless network .

Wireless device may also operate for communications in other different wireless networks such as a wireless network which is also a WLAN. In this example wireless network is a private communication network of an enterprise e.g. an organization a company a corporation etc. of wireless device . Similar to wireless network wireless network has a plurality of wireless APs and one or more servers and a gateway . For devices connected in wireless network via one of wireless APs and gateway may be configured to permit or deny access to the data applications and or functionality offered via wireless network depending on whether or not a device has been authorized and what access rights are given upon authorization. For devices attempting to access wireless network via Internet gateway is configured to permit or deny internal access to the data applications and or functionality in wireless network .

Such wireless networks e.g. infrastructure WLANs may provide or allow access to various data and communication services to its terminals. For example the wireless networks may provide for communication access to Internet via the Web browser application or voice telephony communication service with use of Voice over IP VoIP communication or other communication services. For push type data or message synchronization services for example wireless device may be enabled to maintain data synchronization with a server e.g. server or for user data of an application associated with a user account. The application of wireless device and the server may be or include for example an electronic mail e mail application program for the communication of e mail messages.

Wireless device may be additionally configured to access communication services via a Public Land Wireless Network PLMN e.g. a cellular telecommunications network . PLMN includes a core network a plurality of base station controllers such as a base station controller BSC coupled to core network and a plurality of base stations such as a base station BS and a base station coupled to associated BSCs . Core network BSC and BS operate in a conventional fashion as well documented. Other PLMNs in the environment have a similar or the same architecture as PLMN . For communication with PLMNs wireless device may be configured in accordance with one or more cellular telecommunication standards such as Global Systems for Mobile GSM and or General Packet Radio Service GPRS technologies. However such wireless device may additionally or alternatively operate in accordance with other such cellular standards such as Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE or Enhanced GPRS EGPRS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Long Term Evolution LTE or EVolution Data Only EV DO for CDMA technologies as a few examples.

Further in additional to being operative for communications with infrastructure WLANs e.g. IEEE 802.11 infrastructure WLANs wireless device may additionally or alternatively communicate using peer to peer communication techniques for example in accordance with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification and or be certified as a Wi Fi Direct device. The Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Accordingly illustrating further in wireless device and one or more other wireless devices and in may be operative to establish Wi Fi P2P network connections with each other in a Wi Fi P2P network. Here one of the communicate devices may be configured to enter into an AP mode of operation so that other communication devices may associate with them for direct RF communications therebetween. In some environments a wireless device may operate in an AP mode of operation as what is referred to as a group owner GO . Such operation provides a benefit due to the high data rates available over WLAN links. Here again data may be communicated directly between the wireless devices without the data traversing any wireless network infrastructure where one of the devices is set to operate or serve as an AP switching operation from as an end terminal and the other device operates as an end terminal to associate and connect with the AP i.e. wireless device operating as an AP for communications. Wireless device may operate such that when operating as an AP with other communication devices and it also operates as a client station with another AP see e.g. discussion later in relation to .

More On Use Cases Additional Alternative Profile Details. It is noted that many peer to peer use cases for Wi Fi P2P networking lend themselves to different modes of operation. For example if a wireless device supports a network gateway feature e.g. a mobile hotspot or MHO feature then the wireless device may be configured to establish a persistent Wi Fi P2P network when the service is enabled. As another example the same wireless device may require a printer service to allow an application to print a document. In this case the Wi Fi P2P network may be established on demand based on an application trigger. In another example a social networking application may periodically search for other communication devices running the same social networking application which may result in the wireless device operating in a periodic discovery mode for other devices which advertise the same service.

To accommodate for such various use cases profiles associated with the various application services utilizing Wi Fi P2P networks are created and stored on the wireless device. These profiles are enabled when needed such as enabled in response to an activation of an application associated therewith. Further the profiles may be enabled concurrently.

In one embodiment the profiles may have data structures defined for compatibility with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification. Each profile may include information specific to Wi Fi P2P network operation including device discovery behavior service discovery options co existence with infrastructure connectivity as well as operational characteristics of the network e.g. whether it is persistent or triggered on application launch . These profiles may be provisioned as defaults in the wireless device and or may be configured by applications when installed.

The profiles are used to manage the behavior of the WLAN or Wi H driver of the wireless device to accommodate for the various application services. The driver may be configured to support each particular use case. More particularly the driver may use the profile information to manage peer to peer communications on the wireless device as well as to arbitrate between Wi Fi P2P network and other modes of connectivity e.g. infrastructure STA mode . The driver may be further configured to support other application requirements such as sleep modes discovery modes and or co existence with an infrastructure network connection over WLAN etc. An example set of properties and or parameters relating to the behavioral characteristics were provided earlier above.

Referring now ahead to what is shown a flowchart for describing a method for use in communicating in a P2P network. The method of may be performed by wireless device described in relation to above. In such technique the wireless device may operate substantially in accordance or compatible with the Wi Fi P2P network protocols in the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification.

The techniques described in relation to the flowchart of may be performed by one or more controllers or processors of the wireless device along with its wireless or RF transceiver s . A computer program product which may embody the technique may include a computer readable medium e.g. memory of the communication device computer disk CD ROM etc. having computer instructions stored therein which are executable by the one or more processors of the wireless device for performing the technique.

Beginning at a start block of a wireless device operates to establish a P2P network with other P2P devices step of . Here the wireless device operates in an access point AP mode of operation so that P2P devices may associate with it for direct RF communications. Data may be communicated directly between the P2P devices without the data traversing any fixed wireless network infrastructure. For this purpose the wireless device may operate as a group owner GO in the P2P network. For example the wireless device may operate as a GO substantially in accordance with or compatible with the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification.

In addition the wireless device may perform concurrent operations as a client station with another AP see e.g. the discussion in relation to . In order to communicate with this other AP as a client station the wireless device must temporarily cease communications with the P2P devices. Further in order to ensure that the P2P devices will not attempt to communicate with the wireless device while it communicates with the other AP the wireless device communicates the times during which it will be absent or unavailable for communications with the P2P devices. This operation will be described in more detail below.

Next the wireless device identifies the type of communications which are established or to be established with each one of the P2P devices step of . There may be a plurality of different types of communications established between the P2P devices and the group owner. For example the type of communications may be defined by at least in part a minimum bandwidth requirement for the communications.

In some embodiments the type of communications may be identified by a traffic class or Quality of Service QoS criteria associated with the communications.

Note that a traffic class may be a conversational or voice traffic class a streaming traffic class an interactive traffic class or a background traffic class. A conversational or voice traffic class is associated with traditional voice communications which are usually two way and sensitive to delay delay variation and data loss. A streaming traffic class is typically associated with one way communications which are less sensitive to delay and data loss but are sensitive to delay variations and typically require a high bandwidth. An example of streaming traffic class is a video player application. On the other hand an interactive traffic class is typically associated with two way bursty types of communications. These communications can tolerate moderate delay and data loss and have variable bandwidth requirements. On line video game and web surfing browser applications are examples of the interactive traffic class. Finally a background traffic class is typically associated with communications which are highly tolerant of delay and data loss and may have variable bandwidth requirements. Examples of these applications include e mail and file transfer applications.

The wireless device assigns or groups the P2P devices into different multicast groups step of . In some embodiments the wireless device assigns or groups the P2P device into different multicast groups based on the identifying in step . More particularly the wireless device assigns or groups one or more P2P devices having the same or substantially the same type of communications into the same multicast group. Thus each multicast group is associated with the same or substantially the same type of communications but with a different type of communications from all other multicast groups.

In some embodiments each multicast group may simply include one or more P2P devices determined to have a bandwidth requirement within a predetermined range. In some other embodiments each multicast group may include one or more P2P devices having communications with the same traffic class or QoS criteria. For example the wireless device may group one or more first P2P devices having communications associated with a voice traffic class into a first multicast group and one or more second P2P devices having communications associated with a streaming traffic class into a second multicast group.

In the technique a multicast address is assigned to each one of the multicast groups. The assignment and communication of the multicast address may be done in any suitable manner. In some embodiments a multicast address may be determined and communicated by the group owner when each P2P device joins the group e.g. the assignment may be communicated in an association frame . In some other embodiments the multicast address may be negotiated between P2P devices using a new Public Action frame e.g. a newly defined frame named NoAGroupRequest Response frame . In yet other embodiments a multicast address may be determined and communicated as part of an application or service where the application or service includes information indicating the traffic class or QoS criteria. Here there may be a multicast group assigned to each application type e.g. printing video streaming VoIP etc. .

The wireless device then calculates or otherwise determines or selects different Notice of Absence NoA data for each multicast group step of . Each NoA data includes at least a time period of absence for communicating with the P2P devices of the multicast group. If communications are necessary the wireless device will communicate with the P2P devices outside of the time period of absence from the first. NoA data.

In some embodiments the NoA data may be or include a NoA attribute. The NoA attribute may be defined in the Wi Fi Peer To Peer P2P Technical specification for example. Here the NoA attribute includes a start time an interval a duration and a count. In some embodiments the durations of absence for each multicast group are set to be different but the start times the intervals and the counts are set to be the same for each multicast group. In some other embodiments the counts may be set to be different for each multicast group.

The duration of absence for each multicast group may be determined based on the minimum bandwidth requirement for the multicast group. More particularly the duration of absence for a multicast group may be calculated to be inversely related to the bandwidth requirement for the multicast group. For example the multicast group with the largest bandwidth requirement may be calculated to have the smallest duration of absence. The counts may similarly be varied.

The wireless device then produces and sends a multicast message with the NoA data associated with a multicast group step of . In order to communicate with all of the P2P devices in the multicast group the multicast message includes the multicast address associated with the group see e.g. . If there are one or more additional multicast groups to be processed as identified at step of the wireless device will produce and send a multicast message with the NoA data associated with this additional multicast group repeating step .

Multicast addressing is now discussed with reference back to which is an illustration of a format of a message including an address field which may be populated with an address for multicast messaging. The address may be referred to as a MAC address or a layer 2 address. MAC is used for access to the physical layer from the data link layer according to the ISO OSI model. Address field may include an indication which indicates whether the address is a unicast address or a multicast address. The indication may be a bit indication in address field e.g. the least significant bit of the most significant octet of the address . If the least significant bit of the most significant octet of the address is set to zero 0 the frame is intended to reach only a single receiving device. This type of communication or addressing may be referred to as unicast communication or addressing. Here a unicast frame is transmitted to all nodes within the collision domain which typically ends at the nearest network switch or router. Only the node with the matching hardware MAC address will accept the frame and network frames with non matching MAC addresses are ignored. On the other hand if the least significant bit of the most significant octet of the address is set to one 1 the frame will still be sent only once however devices may accept the frame based on different criteria than a matching MAC address. For example devices may accept the frame based on a configurable list of accepted multicast MAC addresses. This type of communication or addressing may be referred to as multicast communication or addressing.

In some embodiments wireless device may send such messages in a beacon frame in step of . In IEEE 802.11 a typical beacon frame is approximately fifty bytes long with about half of that being a common frame header and cyclic redundancy checking CRC field for error detection capability. The beacon frame body resides between the header and the CRC field and constitutes the other half of the beacon frame. As with other frames the header includes source and destination MAC addresses as well as other information regarding the communications process. For traditional broadcasts the destination address is set to all ones which is the broadcast MAC address. This causes all stations on the channel to receive and process each beacon frame. Using multicast groups per the present disclosure the destination address is set to a multicast address associated with the specific multicast group.

In some embodiments a plurality of multicast groups may be communicated in a single beacon. This may be done for example by communicating with use of an existing or newly defined IEEE 802.11 element. The newly defined IEEE 802.11 element may have the following format for example 

Continuing with if there is a new message to be processed step of then the wireless device repeats steps and for again producing and sending the messages. If a new P2P device has entered in the P2P network step of the wireless device repeats the technique at step i.e. to identify the type of communications for any new P2P device step i.e. to group the P2P devices into different multicast groups step i.e. to calculate or adjust the NoA data for each multicast group etc. Otherwise the technique repeats step . Note that step may additionally or alternatively include identifying whether an existing P2P device has left the P2P network whether the type of communications for an existing P2P device has changed to a different type of communications or some or all of the above.

In the present embodiment P2P device is in a first multicast group and P2P device is in a second multicast group. In the timing diagram both P2P devices and are operating in the active mode. P2P device of the first multicast group places itself in a doze state during a doze period corresponding to each absence period and exits the doze state and communicates if necessary in each data period which follows the doze period . On the other hand P2P device of the second multicast group places itself in a doze state during a doze period and exits the doze state and communicates if necessary in each data period which follows the doze period .

As mentioned the wireless device operating as the group owner sends different NoA data to the first and the second multicast groups. In particular the first multicast group which includes P2P device receives a first absence period from the wireless device and the second multicast group which includes P2P device receives a second absence period from the wireless device that is greater than the first absence period received by the first multicast group.

In this example the first multicast group may be of the voice or conversational traffic class and or or have a relatively low minimum bandwidth requirement whereas the second multicast group may be of the streaming traffic class and or have a relatively high minimum bandwidth requirement.

Thus as described herein a wireless device is configured to operate as a group owner GO in a peer to peer P2P network. The wireless device sends a first multicast message to one or more first P2P devices in the P2P network. The first multicast message includes first notice of absence NoA data. The wireless device also sends a second multicast message to one or more second P2P devices in the P2P network. The second multicast message includes second notice of absence NoA data. Partitioning in the P2P network in this fashion may be set based on the different types of communications established for the P2P devices e.g. the different traffic classes or Quality of Service QoS types .

In addition other techniques for a wireless peer to peer P2P device which is configured to communicate in a P2P network having a group owner GO are described. In one illustrative example a technique involves the actions of receiving from the group owner a multicast message which includes notice of absence NoA data. The NoA data includes a time period of absence from the P2P network. The wireless P2P device may communicate with the group owner outside of the time period of absence indicated in the NoA data of the multicast message. On the other hand the wireless P2P device refrains from communicating with the group owner during the time period of absence in the NoA data of the multicast message. The time period of absence with the group owner may be based on the type of communications established with the wireless P2P device i.e. the traffic class or Quality of Service QoS type .

The above described embodiments of the present disclosure are intended to be examples only. Those of skill in the art may affect alterations modifications and variations to the particular embodiments without departing from the scope of the application. Although the description relates to specific examples for illustration where the WLAN is an IEEE 802.11 based network for example different environments may be applicable as well. As a few other examples the wireless networking may be based on a WiMAX network i.e. IEEE 802.16 or an Ultra WideBand UWB network i.e. IEEE 802.15 . The invention described herein in the recited claims intends to cover and embrace all suitable changes in technology.
