The present application is a continuation in part application of and claims priority from related co pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 456 269 filed on Jun. 5 2009 now abandoned entitled Method and Apparatus for Simultaneous Synthetic Aperture Radar and Moving Target Indication by Paul Antonik and Michael C. Wicks. Accordingly U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 456 269 is herein incorporated by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

This invention relates generally to the field of radar. More specifically the present invention relates to synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication modes of such radars.

Radar has been developed to provide detection tracking and imaging of objects in all weather conditions using electromagnetic signals. Moving target indication is a particular mode of radar in which stationary objects are separated from objects in motion. Typically this is accomplished by passing successive radar returns through a subtraction circuit. The returns of objects which are not moving remain the same from pulse to pulse resulting in their removal through the differencing process. On the other hand the returns of moving objects vary in phase and amplitude on successive pulses so that the returns of targets in motion are not cancelled.

The angular resolution of a radar beam is inversely related to the physical dimensions of the radar antenna. Moving target indication is typically employed for detection and tracking functions which require only modest radar beamwidths. At the same time large antennas are often required to provide sufficient gain. Multiple channel phased array antennas were developed in part to provide a wide field of view concurrent with fine angular resolution.

The imaging function requires a higher degree of angular resolution than detection or tracking and therefore requires a much larger antenna. The synthetic aperture radar technique was invented to produce long virtual apertures by translating a small physical aperture in space using the motion of the host platform. As the physical aperture is moved the signals transmitted and received by the aperture are phase shifted and added to produce a resultant sum that is similar to that of a larger physical aperture with many elements or subarrays. The virtual aperture is M times larger than the physical aperture where M is the number of signals integrated and results in a corresponding improvement in spatial resolution on the ground. In strip map mode the antenna beam of the radar system remains in a fixed angular pointing direction and an image of the surface is formed as the beam moves over the area to be imaged due to motion of the radar platform. In spotlight synthetic aperture radar the direction of the beam pointing changes as the platform moves to keep the beam pointing at a fixed location on the ground. Multi channel synthetic aperture radars have been developed using a phased array antenna and multiple receiver channels.

Besides different antenna provisions synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication have conflicting waveform requirements. Synthetic aperture radar requires a wide beamwidth waveform whereas moving target indication employs a relatively narrowband signal. The two functions also specify differing pulse repetition frequency requirements. These different demands require that synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication be performed either sequentially or using separate systems although in some cases moving target indication information is derived from synthetic aperture radar images.

The multi channel radio camera was invented to provide for array distortion correction in synthetic aperture and inverse synthetic aperture radar.

The frequency diverse array see U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 319 427 and 7 511 665 B2 was invented to provide range dependent beamforming as well as control of adaptive transmit signals for the simultaneous use of radiated energy for multiple conflicting requirements.

A limitation of the prior art is that synthetic aperture radar requires a small aperture to provide a wide beam width to allow long integration times whereas moving target indication requires large apertures for high gain narrow beam widths and low antenna sidelobes which aid in clutter suppression.

Another limitation of the prior art is that moving target indication implemented using synthetic aperture radar has been constrained to along track interferometry and to image change detection which requires that images be formed prior to the detection of moving targets.

Still another limitation of the prior art is that spot light and strip map modes of synthetic aperture radar cannot be operated simultaneously.

Yet another limitation of the prior art is that synthetic aperture radar and real beam moving target indication cannot be performed simultaneously.

Still yet another limitation of the prior art is that a congested radio frequency spectrum constricts contiguous bandwidth available for high resolution imaging.

The present invention provides a method and apparatus to produce synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication at the same time in a manner which overcomes all of the aforementioned limitations of the prior art. The invention utilizes independent waveform generation timing and control across multiple apertures in a phased array radar to provide simultaneous synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication as well as aids to navigation and embedded communications. Waveform generation produces narrowband waveform building blocks called sub waveforms or basis functions. Different basis functions are radiated from different antennas or elements. This permits the simultaneous transmission of multiple waveforms at different frequencies as opposed to sequential transmission of waveforms for varied functions.

On reception signals are sorted by pulse aperture and frequency and are arranged for the simultaneous processing for moving target indication and synthetic aperture radar imaging.

Moving target indication processing is applied at the building block level. An M pulse Doppler processor is applied after M 1 two pulse cancellers for each aperture. Doppler compensation is applied across apertures to scale for different frequencies for each spatial channel. Integration is then performed across apertures.

Wideband synthetic aperture radar waveforms are synthesized from the narrow band components across space and time utilizing interpolation and extrapolation. One monostatic and N 1 bistatic synthetic aperture radar images are formed for each of N channels. Integration is then performed across apertures and pulses.

The present invention therefore results in simultaneous moving target indication and synthetic aperture radar. The present invention also results in strip map and spotlight synthetic aperture at the same time. Alternative embodiments of the present invention provide for the simultaneous emission and processing of communications and navigation signals.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that overcomes the prior art s limitation of sequential moving target indication and synthetic aperture radar.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein spotlight and strip map synthetic aperture radar can be performed simultaneously through common equipment.

It is yet still a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus wherein signals of multiple classes can be radiated and utilized at the same time such as synthetic aperture radar signals simultaneously with ground moving target indication signals or communications signals simultaneously with radar signals.

An additional object of the present invention is to overcome a fundamental limitation of conventional synthetic aperture radar wherein a small aperture is required for long dwell and fine cross range resolution.

Briefly stated the present invention method and apparatus for simultaneous synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication achieves these and other objects through independent control of signals applied to radiating elements and through processing methods. A plurality of independent radio frequency signals are generated and applied to separate radiating receiving antenna elements. Signals are generated as basis functions such that moving target detection and synthetic aperture radar signals are constructed from individual waveform components in space time frequency and coding. Waveform components are sorted and combined at reception. Received data is simultaneously processed to extract synthetic aperture radar images and moving target indication detections.

In the fundamental embodiment of the present invention different waveform basis functions at different frequencies are applied to separate radiating elements permitting the transmission of multiple signals at the same time. M pulses are transmitted from each channel and the reflected signals from each transmission are received on all channels. Signals are reconstructed in a signal processor to perform multiple functions at the same time. For moving target indication M 1 two pulse cancellers are formed from M pulses at each aperture. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the signals at each aperture are at different frequencies so that signals across apertures are scaled prior to Doppler filtering by f f where fis the reference frequency and fis the center frequency of the naperture. Phase compensation is also applied across apertures to account for waveform to waveform phase variation due to target complexity. Target phase information is quantized into n steps and a knowledge based controller is used to select the appropriate phase. A sequential detector is formed across frequency bins. Integration across apertures is then performed to provide gain and beam width commensurate with the full array.

In an alternative embodiment one monostatic and N 1 bistatic moving target indication processes are formed for each of N spatial channels. All Nmoving target indication outputs are then combined to form a single output.

For synthetic aperture radar a wideband signal is constructed from narrowband basis functions across multiple apertures. Interpolation and extrapolation algorithms are applied to a wide bandwidth signal over space and slow time thus forming a real time sequential imager. Each spatial channel also provides a conventional synthetic aperture radar so that the full array provides a multiple channel synthetic aperture radar capability. In an alternative embodiment each spatial channel provides one monostatic and N 1 bistatic synthetic aperture radars and the Nsynthetic aperture radar outputs are then combined into a single integrated output.

According to an embodiment of the present invention method and apparatus for simultaneous synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication comprises a radio frequency signal source a series of multiplexers a bank of amplifiers a bank of phase shifters an array of radiating elements and a waveform control subsystem.

In contrast to prior art devices the present invention produces synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication at the same time as well as spotlight and strip map modes of synthetic aperture radar at the same time. Nothing in the prior art teaches or suggests this feature of the present invention.

Therefore it is accurate to say that the present invention 1. can produce synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication at the same time 2. can produce strip map and spotlight modes of synthetic aperture radar at the same time and 3. provides a means to manage radar imaging bandwidth requirements in a congested radio frequency spectrum. As such the present invention represents a significant improvement over prior art methods and apparatus.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals designate the same elements.

Referring to the key components of a method and apparatus for simultaneous synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication include a plurality of waveform generators a transmitter receiver module a waveform control subsystem and a radiating element array .

A first second through nwaveform generator synthesize signals to be transmitted. The signals output from each of the waveform generators are applied to a transmitter receiver module . The waveform generators the first and second through ninputs and outputs of the transmitter receiver module and the first and second through nantenna radiating receiving elements are interconnected such that any first second and nwaveform generator output can be applied to any and all first second through nspatial channels. The outputs of the transmit receive module are provided to a like plurality of antenna radiating receiving elements through . A waveform control subsystem provides frequency control signals and first phase control signals to the waveform generators through respectively. The frequency and first phase control signals provide pulse to pulse and element to element frequency and phase diversity to the waveform generators as a function of time. It is readily appreciated by one skilled in the art that software control can provide for frequency and phase control signals applied to each waveform generator that may be independently varied or scaled both linearly and non linearly with respect to time and additionally within the time between successive pulses. The waveform control subsystem further provides a plurality of amplitude control signals and second phase control signals to each respective amplitude means and and second phase control means and of each channel respectively of the transmit receive module . The amplitude control signals permit power control as well as a mechanism to apply amplitude weighting for antenna beam sidelobe control. The second phase control signals introduce a radiating receive element to radiating receive element phase shift for electronic beam steering and phase compensation and correction. The frequency control signals and the first phase control signals permit the radiation of multiple signal modes at the same time.

Still referring to . a plurality of spatial channels is depicted. The actual number of transmitter receiver module signal outputs W . . . WN and in the preferred embodiment depends upon the number of antenna elements and . It follows that the number of amplifiers and and phase shifters and will be identical to the number of antenna radiating receiving elements and .

Referring now to a method of multi channel space time illumination for simultaneous synthetic aperture radar and moving target indication is depicted. Signals from multiple radar pulses and are radiated over time from each first second through nantenna radiating receiving elements and as the aperture translates due to platform motion depicted as vector V . The transmission of the mpulse from the nantenna denoted as Rt is reflected from a target on the ground which may be moving. The reflected signals received at all spatial channels thus forming one monostatic response and N 1 bistatic responses for each channel where N refers to the number of antenna radiating receiving elements. shows the reflected signal denoted as Rr for the mpulse received at the n 1 element. In general all waveforms are not identical for each spatial channel. Waveforms may be orthogonal or nearly orthogonal to simplify signal separation on receive. Still referring to the case where subarrays spatial channels are not overlapped and signals do not overlap in time is depicted. In general subarrays and temporal signals may overlap.

Referring now to methods of illumination are compared for separate moving target indication and synthetic aperture radar modes in frequency versus time. Moving target indication signals and are radiated from antenna radiating receiving elements and see see also respectively and are relatively narrow band and short duration. Alternatively synthetic aperture radar signals and are radiated from antenna radiating receiving elements and and are relatively wide band and long duration. The moving target indication signals can be considered to be subsets of the synthetic aperture radar signals.

Referring now to a space time illumination to achieve synthetic aperture radar and ground moving target indication at the same time is depicted in frequency versus time. Signals and are radiated from elements and respectively see see also . In general the signals radiated from multiple elements overlap in time creating a phased array effect. In the prior art synthetic aperture radar and ground moving target indication are inherently disparate processes. Synthetic aperture radar is an integration process which requires on the order of hundreds of megahertz of bandwidth to achieve sufficient range resolution for imaging. Ground moving target indication is a differencing process that requires only several megahertz of bandwidth for detection. The present invention permits modes to be constructed to support synthetic aperture radar and ground moving target indication at the same time by providing chirp diversity and phase modulation across the transmit receive elements through see see also and processing all elements in combination and individually.

Referring now to methods of illumination are depicted for conventional and sequential imaging modes utilizing the present invention in a frequency versus number of radiating receiving elements representation. In conventional synthetic aperture radar a single radiating channel is used to radiate a wideband pulse. In the sequential imaging mode portions of the full imaging signal or basis functions are radiated from each spatial channel and the full signal is reconstructed in the signal processor. It is not necessary for the signals from adjacent elements to be contiguous. Multi element signal is constructed from a plurality of basis functions each containing a non contiguous portion of the full bandwidth signal. Extrapolation and interpolation is utilized to determine full signal content. Any combination of signals provides the full transmitted signal. Signal represents a highly non contiguous set of sub waveforms or basis functions which sum to the same amalgamated signal .

Referring now to various methods of illumination are depicted for arranging combined moving target indication and synthetic aperture radar signals in a frequency space and time representation. Signals and are different sub waveforms radiated from a single radiating receiving element see see also. . Alternatively signals and are radiated separately from elements and see see also respectively. Alternatively signals and are radiated from elements and respectively at the same time.

The present invention see permits the generation and emission of separate sub waveforms including linear frequency modulation chirps or continuous wave tones from each radiating element and . These sub waveforms can be stored sorted and emitted in any sequence including but not limited to being radiated in the order of low frequency to high frequency high frequency to low frequency or in a prescribed or pseudo random fashion according to algorithms described in the literature for example 1 3 . These radiated sub waveforms reflect off of targets and return to the transmit receive elements and . The received sub waveforms collectively form an amalgamated waveform at each element and are recorded and stored sequentially in time according to a first out first basis.

Referring now to a generalized data cube is depicted which is formed by enumerating the sub waveforms or basis functions received and stored at all elements for all radar pulses. The received amalgamated waveform can be sorted by dividing it into pulses which correspond to the individual sub waveform length or the period of the overall amalgamated waveform. The received sub waveforms can be further sorted by frequency using prior knowledge of waveform generation timing and control of the transmitted signal or by measurement using a frequency counter or spectrum analyzer. The received data cube which is stored in a digital corner turn memory is then processed simultaneously to extract moving target indication detection declarations and synthetic aperture radar images. The sub waveforms stored in the data cube see can be rank ordered or sorted in terms of frequency to achieve a traditional swept frequency modulated signal. Traditional pulse compression methods including stretch processing 4 for wideband waveforms are then immediately available. Rank ordering provides simplicity in achieving Doppler tolerance against slightly varying slope chirp such as through the method of VanEtten 5 . However there is no requirement to rank order the sub waveforms as a more general filter matched to the transmitted signal is also available a priori. The matched filter is well known as the convolution of the received signal with a time reversed replica of the transmitted signal. Doppler tolerance can still be achieved by applying a frequency offset to each sub waveform to match the Doppler frequency of the target or background environment in effect creating Doppler steering vectors. These Doppler steering vectors can be applied by weighting in time through frequency control signals first phase control signals and second phase control signals .

To achieve stripmap SAR imaging distinct narrowband sub waveforms are first radiated by each spatial channel they are then reflected back from a target and form a broadband amalgamated waveform which is received at every spatial channel. This arrangement enables the decoupling of antenna size from cross range resolution classically limited to d 2 in conventional SAR systems where d is the aperture length along track parallel to the aircraft velocity vector. The narrowband sub waveforms are rank ordered out of the data cube into a swept linear frequency modulated signal for wideband SAR beam sharpening at the element level. Alternatively the returns from multiple elements can be summed to achieve integration gain against thermal noise or differenced to achieve along track interferometric SAR.

Spotlight SAR an alternative to stripmap SAR functions by focusing on a small area on the surface of the earth. Selectivity in addressing radiating and receiving elements spatial channels phase and Doppler compensation in post processing is key to achieving spotlight functionality from a SAR. Since spotlight SAR permits longer dwell times improved cross range resolution is possible with large apertures at the expense of area coverage. Beam steering to keep the desired area on the surface of the earth illuminated is attained by applying a linearly varying phase shift across the selected aperture by means of phase control signals . A steering vector is similarly achieved on receive by applying an identical linearly varying phase shift in the form of weights applied to a discrete Fourier transform across selected spatial channels. The weights can provide adaptive beam forming by the application of a sampled matrix inversion process rather than a discrete Fourier transform 6 . By beamforming at the sub waveform level and re ordering a constant broadband chirp waveform is attained for conventional pulse compression at each spot on the ground.

The present invention also permits simultaneous adjacent spotlight SAR images to be formed thus enabling spotlight SAR resolution over a large area which is also a limitation of and not achievable by conventional prior art approaches. The subject invention radiates unique sub waveforms at the selected element level resulting in the illumination of a large coverage area. By selectively addressing radiating elements multiple beamforming outputs can be formed simultaneously thus resulting in multiple spotlight SAR beams. On receive because each element receives all energy radiated across the amalgamated waveform selective post processing is critical to extracting data from just the spotlighted target area.

With regard to the present invention s ability to perform moving target indication MTI because MTI is an inherently narrowband process 7 the present invention sub bands the amalgamated waveform into multiple narrowband signals. Since MTI is achieved on an individual sub waveform basis rank ordering is not required prior to clutter suppression and target enhancement.

The present invention achieves MTI functionality by selectively employing individual apertures and does not combine them as does conventional SAR. Beamforming is achieved through a linearly varying phase shift applied to selected apertures as opposed to all apertures as in SAR on transmit and application of a steering vector applied to selected apertures as opposed to all apertures as in SAR on receive as described earlier. Moving target indication on received signals using a SAR is obtained by the application of a multiple pulse canceller which is in effect a form of MTI filter to achieve high subclutter visibility. As a result the selectivity applied to apertures on both transmit and receive result in the selectivity of MTI filtering as well. The broadband response can then be reconstituted from the post MTI outputs. This can be performed post detection for integration gain or pre detection for high range resolution. Since the data is stored in digital memory both methods can be applied simultaneously.

Referring now to a method and apparatus is depicted for the simultaneous processing of received basis functions at all elements for synthetic aperture radar imaging and moving target indication. Generalized data cube is input to pulse compression unit . Pulse compressed data is then passed simultaneously to the synthetic aperture radar processor and moving target indication processor . The synthetic aperture radar processor first utilizes a corner turn memory to arrange the input data by pulses. An accumulator then sums i.e. integrates signals received from selected apertures and selected moving target filters. A vector matched filter receiver is applied over all spatial channels followed by a registration unit to combine returns from all combinations of monostatic and bistatic pairs. However the vector matched filter selectively filters data i.e. compressed pulses of interest from the corner turn memory. This selectively filtered data may also be selectively summed in an accumulator in a manner corresponding to the selected spatial channels i.e. selected apertures and moving target filters of interest. Image is output from the synthetic aperture radar processor .

Still referring to moving target indication processor first utilizes corner turn memory to arrange data in data cube form by pulses. The corner turn memory output is applied to a differencing unit which contains M 1 two pulse canceller circuits at each frequency where M is the number of radar pulses. Corner turn memory is utilized to arrange data by aperture or element. Multiplier applies frequency and phase compensation signals. Frequency compensation signal applies a frequency scale of Doppler components for each aperture. Doppler components are scaled by f f where fis the reference frequency and fis the carrier frequency of the nelement. Phase compensation signal corrects phase variation across waveforms due to target complexity and is generated by sequential phase detector . Doppler and phase compensated signals are then input to accumulator which coherently integrates signals across apertures and moving target indication filters. Registration unit combines returns from all combinations of monostatic bistatic pairs. Detector performs magnitude detection threshold setting and detection declaration. Detections are output from the moving target indication processor .

Referring now to operation of sequential phase detector see is depicted. Target complexity and varying carrier frequency introduce a phase variation from waveform to waveform which can be represented as a series of vectors . To achieve phase compensation prior to coherent integration across waveforms an incremental vector V is added to received vector V to achieve quantized phase V. Phase is quantized into N steps. Referring still to eight steps are shown although finer partitioning is possible. Phase quantization can be performed with the aid of a knowledge based controller to account for known variation of frequency across waveforms.

Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
