This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 552 525 entitled Clinical Predictive and Monitoring System and Method and filed on Oct. 28 2011 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 700 557 entitled Dashboard User Interface System and Method filed on Sep. 13 2012.

The practice of medicine is increasingly characterized by overwhelming amounts of information new knowledge in diagnostics and therapeutics and highly fragmented care environments with potentially hundreds of different individuals delivering care to a single patient across healthcare settings. Coordinating clinical decisions to advance the care and treatment of patients within this environment poses significant challenges. Hospital readmission is an important example of the type of problems health systems face in allocating critical resources in the midst of this fragmented environment.

Many patients are unnecessarily readmitted to the hospital. A 2009 study published in the Jencks S. F. et al. Rehospitalizations among Patients in the Medicare Fee for Service Program 360 2009 1418 28 demonstrated that almost one fifth of Medicare patients were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge and 34 were readmitted within 90 days. This research estimated that only 10 of these readmissions were planned and that the annual cost to Medicare alone of unplanned hospital readmissions exceeds 17 billion.

For example patients with heart failure the leading diagnosis for acute care hospitalization and readmissions for patients over the age of 65 face particular challenges in transitioning from the hospital to home and hospital readmissions are common for these patients. Preparation for discharge is often fragmented and many patients and families feel ill prepared for discharge. Upon discharge responsibility for management of patients reverts back to their primary care provider who may have no record of the care or medications given during the hospital stay. This lack of coordinated care results in frequent readmissions with a large percentage of patients discharged with heart failure being readmitted to the hospital within several months.

While not all readmissions are preventable it is estimated that a significant percentage of heart failure readmissions is avoidable with better patient education better communication with the patient and the patient s primary care provider ensuring that the patient has appropriate follow up scheduled at the time of discharge and other targeted intervention and treatment. However most hospitals fail to consistently implement most or all of these elements. Many interventions can be expensive and complicated to perform in the real world. One of the reasons why efforts can fail is that hospitals have difficulty identifying patients that are truly at risk for readmission and for which interventions should be a high priority.

If high risk patients could be more easily and accurately identified early in their hospital stay e.g. in the Emergency Room or upon admission the right interventions could be performed on the population for which it is most needed thereby lowering overall heart failure readmission rates. Today most hospitals attempting to identify patients at risk are doing so manually without leveraging the information available in their electronic health records. Hospital readmission is one of potentially thousands of adverse clinical events that could be prevented by electronic identification targeting coordinating and monitoring throughout the inpatient and outpatient environment. This disclosure describes software developed to identify and risk stratify patients at highest risk for hospital readmissions and other adverse clinical events.

The data received by the clinical predictive and monitoring system may include electronic medical records EMR that include both clinical and non clinical data. The EMR clinical data may be received from entities such as hospitals clinics pharmacies laboratories and health information exchanges including vital signs and other physiological data data associated with comprehensive or focused history and physical exams by a physician nurse or allied health professional medical history prior allergy and adverse medical reactions family medical history prior surgical history emergency room records medication administration records culture results dictated clinical notes and records gynecological and obstetric history mental status examination vaccination records radiological imaging exams invasive visualization procedures psychiatric treatment history prior histological specimens laboratory data genetic information physician s notes networked devices and monitors such as blood pressure devices and glucose meters pharmaceutical and supplement intake information and focused genotype testing.

The EMR non clinical data may include for example social behavioral lifestyle and economic data type and nature of employment job history medical insurance information hospital utilization patterns exercise information addictive substance use occupational chemical exposure frequency of physician or health system contact location and frequency of habitation changes predictive screening health questionnaires such as the patient health questionnaire PHQ personality tests census and demographic data neighborhood environments diet gender marital status education proximity and number of family or care giving assistants address housing status social media data and educational level. The non clinical patient data may further include data entered by the patients such as data entered or uploaded to a social media website.

Additional sources or devices of EMR data may provide for example lab results medication assignments and changes EKG results radiology notes daily weight readings and daily blood sugar testing results. These data sources may be from different areas of the hospital clinics patient care facilities patient home monitoring devices among other available clinical or healthcare sources.

As shown in patient data sources may include non healthcare entities . These are entities or organizations that are not thought of as traditional healthcare providers. These entities may provide non clinical data that include for example gender marital status education community and religious organizational involvement proximity and number of family or care giving assistants address census tract location and census reported socioeconomic data for the tract housing status number of housing address changes frequency of housing address changes requirements for governmental living assistance ability to make and keep medical appointments independence on activities of daily living hours of seeking medical assistance location of seeking medical services sensory impairments cognitive impairments mobility impairments educational level employment and economic status in absolute and relative terms to the local and national distributions of income climate data and health registries. Such data sources may provide further insightful information about patient lifestyle such as the number of family members relationship status individuals who might help care for a patient and health and lifestyle preferences that could influence health outcomes.

The clinical predictive and monitoring system may further receive data from health information exchanges HIE . HIEs are organizations that mobilize healthcare information electronically across organizations within a region community or hospital system. HIEs are increasingly developed to share clinical and non clinical patient data between healthcare entities within cities states regions or within umbrella health systems. Data may arise from numerous sources such as hospitals clinics consumers payers physicians labs outpatient pharmacies ambulatory centers nursing homes and state or public health agencies.

A subset of HIEs connect healthcare entities to community organizations that do not specifically provide health services such as non governmental charitable organizations social service agencies and city agencies. The clinical predictive and monitoring system may receive data from these social services organizations and social to health information exchanges which may include for example information on daily living skills availability of transportation to doctor appointments employment assistance training substance abuse rehabilitation counseling or detoxification rent and utilities assistance homeless status and receipt of services medical follow up mental health services meals and nutrition food pantry services housing assistance temporary shelter home health visits domestic violence appointment adherence discharge instructions prescriptions medication instructions neighborhood status and ability to track referrals and appointments.

Another source of data include social media or social network services such as FACEBOOK and GOOGLE websites. Such sources can provide information such as the number of family members relationship status identify individuals who may help care for a patient and health and lifestyle preferences that may influence health outcomes. These social media data may be received from the websites with the individual s permission and some data may come directly from a user s computing device as the user enters status updates for example.

These non clinical patient data provides a much more realistic and accurate depiction of the patient s overall holistic healthcare environment. Augmented with such non clinical patient data the analysis and predictive modeling performed by the present system to identify patients at high risk of readmission or disease recurrence become much more robust and accurate.

The system is further adapted to receive user preference and system configuration data from clinicians computing devices mobile devices tablet computers laptop computers desktop computers servers etc. in a wired or wireless manner. These computing devices are equipped to display a system dashboard and or another graphical user interface to present system data and reports. For example a clinician healthcare personnel may immediately generate a list of patients that have the highest congestive heart failure risk scores e.g. top n numbers or top x . The graphical user interface are further adapted to receive the user s healthcare personnel input of preferences and configurations etc. The data may be transmitted presented and displayed to the clinician user in the form of web pages web based message text files video messages multimedia messages text messages e mail messages and in a variety of suitable ways and formats.

As shown in the clinical predictive and monitoring system may receive data streamed real time or from historic or batched data from various data sources. Further the system may store the received data in a data store or process the data without storing it first. The real time and stored data may be in a wide variety of formats according to a variety of protocols including CCD XDS HL7 SSO HTTPS EDI CSV etc. The data may be encrypted or otherwise secured in a suitable manner. The data may be pulled polled by the system from the various data sources or the data may be pushed to the system by the data sources. Alternatively or in addition the data may be received in batch processing according to a predetermined schedule or on demand. The data store may include one or more local servers memory drives and other suitable storage devices. Alternatively or in addition the data may be stored in a data center in the cloud.

The computer system may comprise a number of computing devices including servers that may be located locally or in a cloud computing farm. The data paths between the computer system and the data store may be encrypted or otherwise protected with security measures or transport protocols now known or later developed.

Within 24 hours of a patient s admission to the hospital stored historical and real time data related to the patients are analyzed by the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method to identify specific diseases and conditions related to the patient such as congestive heart failure. Further the system calculates a risk score for congestive heart failure for this particular patient within 24 hours of admission. If this particular patient s risk score for congestive heart failure is above a certain risk threshold then the patient is identified on a list of high risk patients that is presented to an intervention coordination team. The processes for disease identification and risk score calculation are described in more detail below.

The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method are operable to display transmit and otherwise present the list of high risk patients to the intervention coordination team which may include physicians physician assistants case managers patient navigators nurses social workers family members and other personnel or individuals involved with the patient s care. The means of presentment may include e mail text messages multimedia messages voice messages web pages facsimile audible or visual alerts etc. delivered by a number of suitable electronic or portable computing devices. The intervention coordination team may then prioritize intervention for the highest risk patients and provide targeted inpatient care and treatment. The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may further automatically present a plan to include recommended intervention and treatment options. Some intervention plans may include detailed inpatient clinical assessment as well as patient nutrition pharmacy case manager and heart failure education consults starting early in the patient s hospital stay. The intervention coordination team may immediately conduct the ordered inpatient clinical and social interventions. Additionally the plan may include clinical and social outpatient interventions and developing a post discharge plan of care and support.

High risk patients are also assigned a set of high intensity outpatient interventions. Once a targeted patient is discharged outpatient intervention and care begin. Such interventions may include a follow up phone call within 48 hours from the patient s case manager such as a nurse doctors appointment reminders and medication updates outpatient case management for 30 days a follow up appointment in a clinic within 7 days of discharge a subsequent cardiology appointment if needed and a follow up primary care visit. Interventions that have been found to be successful are based on well known readmission reduction programs and strategies designed to significantly reduce 30 day readmissions associated with congestive heart failure.

The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method continue to receive clinical and non clinical data regarding the patient identified as high risk during the hospital stay and after the patient s discharge from the hospital to further improve the diagnosis and modify or augment the treatment and intervention plan if necessary.

After the patient is discharged from the hospital the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method continue to monitor patient intervention status according to the electronic medical records case management systems social services entities and other data sources as described above. The clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may also interact directly with caregivers case managers and patients to obtain additional information and to prompt action. For example the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may notify a physician that one of his or her patients has returned to the hospital the physician can then send a pre formatted message to the system directing it to notify a specific case management team. In another example the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method may recognize that a patient missed a doctor s appointment and hasn t rescheduled. The system may send the patient a text message reminding the patient to reschedule the appointment.

The data extraction process extracts clinical and non clinical data from data sources in real time or in batches either directly or through the Internet using various technologies and protocols. Preferably in real time the data cleansing process cleans or pre processes the data putting structured data in a standardized format and preparing unstructured text for natural language processing NLP to be performed in the disease risk logic module described below. The system may also receive clean data and convert them into desired formats e.g. text date field converted to numeric for calculation purposes .

The data manipulation process may analyze the representation of a particular data feed against a meta data dictionary and determine if a particular data feed should be re configured or replaced by alternative data feeds. For example a given hospital EMR may store the concept of maximum creatinine in different ways. The data manipulation process may make inferences in order to determine which particular data feed from the EMR would best represent the concept of creatinine as defined in the meta data dictionary and whether a feed would need particular re configuration to arrive at the maximum value e.g. select highest value .

The data integration logic module then passes the pre processed data to a disease risk logic module . The disease risk logic module is operable to calculate a risk score associated with an identified disease or condition for each patient and identifying those patients who should receive targeted intervention and care. The disease risk logic module includes a de identification re identification process that is adapted to remove all protected health information according to HIPAA standards before the data is transmitted over the Internet. It is also adapted to re identify the data. Protected health information that may be removed and added back may include for example name phone number facsimile number email address social security number medical record number health plan beneficiary number account number certificate or license number vehicle number device number URL all geographical subdivisions smaller than a State including street address city county precinct zip code and their equivalent geocodes except for the initial three digits of a zip code if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census Internet Protocol number biometric data and any other unique identifying number characteristic or code.

The disease risk logic module further includes a disease identification process . The disease identification process is adapted to identify one or more diseases or conditions of interest for each patient. The disease identification process considers data such as lab orders lab values clinical text and narrative notes and other clinical and historical information to determine the probability that a patient has a particular disease. Additionally during disease identification natural language processing is conducted on unstructured clinical and non clinical data to determine the disease or diseases that the physician believes are prevalent. This process may be performed iteratively over the course of many days to establish a higher confidence in the disease identification as the physician becomes more confident in the diagnosis. The natural language processing combines a rule based model and a statistically based learning model.

The disease identification process utilizes a hybrid model of natural language processing which combines a rule based model and a statistically based learning model. During natural language processing raw unstructured data for example physicians notes and reports first go through a process called tokenization. The tokenization process divides the text into basic units of information in the form of single words or short phrases by using defined separators such as punctuation marks spaces or capitalizations. Using the rule based model these basic units of information are identified in a meta data dictionary and assessed according to predefined rules that determine meaning. Using the statistical based learning model the disease identification process quantifies the relationship and frequency of word and phrase patterns and then processes them using statistical algorithms. Using machine learning the statistical based learning model develops inferences based on repeated patterns and relationships. The disease identification process performs a number of complex natural language processing functions including text pre processing lexical analysis syntactic parsing semantic analysis handling multi word expression word sense disambiguation and other functions.

For example if a physician s notes include the following 55 yo m c h o dm cri. now with adib rvr chfexac and rle cellulitis going to 10 W tele. The data integration logic is operable to translate these notes as Fifty five year old male with history of diabetes mellitus chronic renal insufficiency now with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response congestive heart failure exacerbation and right lower extremity cellulitis going to 10 West and on continuous cardiac monitoring. 

Continuing with the prior example the disease identification process is adapted to further ascertain the following 1 the patient is being admitted specifically for atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure 2 the atrial fibrillation is severe because rapid ventricular rate is present 3 the cellulitis is on the right lower extremity 4 the patient is on continuous cardiac monitoring or telemetry and 5 the patient appears to have diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency.

The disease risk logic module further comprises a predictive model process that is adapted to predict the risk of particular diseases or condition of interest according to one or more predictive models. For example if the hospital desires to determine the level of risk for future heart failure readmission for all patients currently admitted with heart failure the heart failure predictive model may be selected for processing patient data. However if the hospital desires to determine the risk levels for all internal medicine patients for any cause an all cause readmissions predictive model may be used to process the patient data. As another example if the hospital desires to identify those patients at risk for short term and long term diabetic complications the diabetes predictive model may be used to target those patients. Other predictive models may include HIV readmission diabetes identification risk for cardio pulmonary arrest kidney disease progression acute coronary syndrome pneumonia cirrhosis all cause disease independent readmission colon cancer pathway adherence and others.

Continuing to use the prior example the predictive model for congestive heart failure may take into account a set of risk factors or variables including the worst values for laboratory and vital sign variables such as albumin total bilirubin creatine kinase creatinine sodium blood urea nitrogen partial pressure of carbon dioxide white blood cell count troponin I glucose internationalized normalized ratio brain natriuretic peptide pH temperature pulse diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure. Further non clinical factors are also considered for example the number of home address changes in the prior year risky health behaviors e.g. use of illicit drugs or substance number of emergency room visits in the prior year history of depression or anxiety and other factors. The predictive model specifies how to categorize and weight each variable or risk factor and the method of calculating the predicted probably of readmission or risk score. In this manner the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method is able to stratify in real time the risk of each patient that arrives at a hospital or another healthcare facility. Therefore those patients at the highest risks are automatically identified so that targeted intervention and care may be instituted. One output from the disease risk logic module includes the risk scores of all the patients for particular disease or condition. In addition the module may rank the patients according to the risk scores and provide the identities of those patients at the top of the list. For example the hospital may desire to identify the top 20 patients most at risk for congestive heart failure readmission and the top 5 of patients most at risk for cardio pulmonary arrest in the next 24 hours. Other diseases and conditions that may be identified using predictive modeling include for example HIV readmission diabetes identification kidney disease progression colorectal cancer continuum screening meningitis management acid base management anticoagulation management etc.

The disease risk logic module may further include a natural language generation module . The natural language generation module is adapted to receive the output from the predictive model such as the risk score and risk variables for a patient and translate the data to present the evidence that the patient is at high risk for that disease or condition. This module thus provides the intervention coordination team additional information that supports why the patient has been identified as high risk for the particular disease or condition. In this manner the intervention coordination team may better formulate the targeted inpatient and outpatient intervention and treatment plan to address the patient s specific situation.

The disease risk logic module further includes an artificial intelligence AI model tuning process . The artificial intelligence model tuning process utilizes adaptive self learning capabilities using machine learning technologies. The capacity for self reconfiguration enables the system and method to be sufficiently flexible and adaptable to detect and incorporate trends or differences in the underlying patient data or population that may affect the predictive accuracy of a given algorithm. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may periodically retrain a selected predictive model for improved accurate outcome to allow for selection of the most accurate statistical methodology variable count variable selection interaction terms weights and intercept for a local health system or clinic. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may automatically modify or improve a predictive model in three exemplary ways. First it may adjust the predictive weights of clinical and non clinical variables without human supervision. Second it may adjust the threshold values of specific variables without human supervision. Third the artificial intelligence model tuning process may without human supervision evaluate new variables present in the data feed but not used in the predictive model which may result in improved accuracy. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may compare the actual observed outcome of the event to the predicted outcome then separately analyze the variables within the model that contributed to the incorrect outcome. It may then re weigh the variables that contributed to this incorrect outcome so that in the next reiteration those variables are less likely to contribute to a false prediction. In this manner the artificial intelligence model tuning process is adapted to reconfigure or adjust the predictive model based on the specific clinical setting or population in which it is applied. Further no manual reconfiguration or modification of the predictive model is necessary. The artificial intelligence model tuning process may also be useful to scale the predictive model to different health systems populations and geographical areas in a rapid timeframe.

As an example of how the artificial intelligence model tuning process functions the sodium variable coefficients may be periodically reassessed to determine or recognize that the relative weight of an abnormal sodium laboratory result on a new population should be changed from 0.1 to 0.12. Over time the artificial intelligence model tuning process examines whether thresholds for sodium should be updated. It may determine that in order for the threshold level for an abnormal sodium laboratory result to be predictive for readmission it should be changed from for example 140 to 136 mg dL. Finally the artificial intelligence model tuning process is adapted to examine whether the predictor set the list of variables and variable interactions should be updated to reflect a change in patient population and clinical practice. For example the sodium variable may be replaced by the NT por BNP protein variable which was not previously considered by the predictive model.

The results from the disease risk logic module are provided to the hospital personnel such as the intervention coordination team and other caretakers by a data presentation and system configuration logic module . The data presentation logic module includes a dashboard interface that is adapted to provide information on the performance of the clinical predictive and monitoring system and method . A user e.g. hospital personnel administrator and intervention coordination team is able to find specific data they seek through simple and clear visual navigation cues icons windows and devices. The interface may further be responsive to audible commands for example. Because the number of patients a hospital admits each day can be overwhelming a simple graphical interface that maximizes efficiency and reduce user navigation time is desirable. The visual cues are preferably presented in the context of the problem being evaluated e.g. readmissions out of ICU cardiac arrest diabetic complications among others .

The dashboard user interface allows interactive requesting of a variety of views reports and presentations of extracted data and risk score calculations from an operation database within the system. Including for example summary views of a list of patient in a specific care location detailed explanation of the components of the various sub scores graphical representations of the data for a patient or population over time comparison of incidence rates of predicted events to the rates of prediction in a specified time frame summary text clippings lab trends and risk scores on a particular patient for assistance in dictation or preparation of history and physical reports daily notes sign off continuity of care notes operative notes discharge summaries continuity of care documents to outpatient medical practitioners order generation to automate the generation of orders authorized by a local care providers healthcare environment and state and national guidelines to be returned to the practitioner s office outside healthcare provider networks or for return to a hospital or practices electronic medical record aggregation of the data into frequently used medical formulas to assist in care provision including but not limited to acid base calculation MELD score Child Pugh Turcot score TIMI risk score CHADS score estimated creatinine clearance Body Surface area Body Mass Index adjuvant neoadjuvant and metastatic cancer survival nomograms MEWS score APACHE score SWIFT score NIH stroke scale PORT score AJCC staging and publishing of elements of the data on scanned or electronic versions of forms to create automated data forms.

The data presentation and system configuration logic module further includes a messaging interface that is adapted to generate output messaging code in forms such as HL7 messaging text messaging e mail messaging multimedia messaging web pages web portals REST XML computer generated speech constructed document forms containing graphical numeric and text summary of the risk assessment reminders and recommended actions. The interventions generated or recommended by the system and method may include risk score report to the primary physician to highlight risk of readmission for their patients score report via new data field input into the EMR for use by population surveillance of entire population in hospital covered entity accountable care population or other level of organization within a healthcare providing network comparison of aggregate risk of readmissions for a single hospital or among hospitals to allow risk standardized comparisons of hospital readmission rates automated incorporation of score into discharge summary template continuity of care document within providers in the inpatient setting or to outside physician consultants and primary care physicians HL7 message to facility communication of readmission risk transition to nonhospital physicians and communicate subcomponents of the aggregate social environmental score clinical score and global risk score. These scores would highlight potential strategies to reduce readmissions including generating optimized medication lists allowing pharmacies to identify those medication on formulary to reduce out of pocket cost and improve outpatient compliance with the pharmacy treatment plan flagging nutritional education needs identifying transportation needs assessing housing instability to identify need for nursing home placement transitional housing Section 8 HHS housing assistance identifying poor self regulatory behavior for additional follow up phone calls identifying poor social network scores leading to recommendation for additional in home RN assessment flagging high substance abuse score for consultation of rehabilitation counseling for patients with substance abuse issues.

The system and method may automatically generate transmit and present information such as high risk patient lists with risk scores natural language generated text reports recommended actions alerts Continuity of Care Documents flags appointment reminders and questionnaires.

The data presentation and system configuration logic module further includes a system configuration interface . Local clinical preferences knowledge and approaches may be directly provided as input to the predictive models through the system configuration interface . This system configuration interface allows the institution or health system to set or reset variable thresholds predictive weights and other parameters in the predictive model directly. The system configuration interface preferably includes a graphical user interface designed to minimize user navigation time.
