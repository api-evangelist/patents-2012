In one embodiment the indication may be sent from an application program on a client device to a status sharing manager or the like. The user may optionally subscribe the recipient to receive the status. In one embodiment when the recipient is subscribed the recipient may also indicate the media format of the status that the recipient wishes to receive the mode of delivery or the like. In one embodiment a table entry database entry or the like indicating that the recipient is to receive a status of the user is maintained updated or the like based on the subscription. Processing next continues to block .

At block a status of the user is received over a channel. In one embodiment a user inputs the status using an application program interface or the like on a client device. The user sends the status of the user over the channel to a server such as SSS of . In one embodiment the channel may include an application program protocol. The channel may be associated with a particular network protocol a particular application type for sending the status an application type for receiving the status a particular operating system or other platform information associated with the recipient of a status over the channel or the like. Processing next continues to block .

At block a recipient is selected from a plurality of recipients based on a membership of the recipient in the social network. In one embodiment the plurality of recipients may be determined as those members of the social network who have subscribed to receive a status from the user. In one embodiment the recipient may be selected based on a degree of separation between the recipient and the user in the social network. For example the recipient may be one degree of separation from the user e.g. the recipient is in the user s address book buddies list social network of friends . In another embodiment the recipient may be selected based on the media format of the status being sent the content of the status being sent the priority of the status being sent or the like. For example a message of an emergency type may be sent to all recipients or recipients associated with an emergency care group in a social network. Processing next continues to block .

At block another channel associated with the recipient is determined. In one embodiment the other channel is different from the channel used to send the status from the user. For example the user may send the status to a status sharing server over one application protocol e.g. IM . The status sharing server may send the status over the other channel using a different application protocol e.g. SMTP .

In one embodiment a recipient may be associated with a plurality of channels. For example a user may have the recipient identified in a plurality of address books buddy lists or other list of users. Each list may be associated with a different channel for communicating with the members in the list. In one embodiment the different channels associated with a recipient may be aggregated in the social network. For example user A may have the recipient in an IM buddy list but user B may have the recipient in an phone book on a user B s mobile phone. Both the IM channel and the phone channel e.g. phone SMS may be associated with the recipient in the social network. In one embodiment at least one of the aggregated channels is selected to be used to send the status of the user to the recipient.

In one embodiment the selection of the other channel is based on an availability of the other channel. For example the recipient may be actively using an application program e.g. email IM logged into a social networking website . In an alternate embodiment the other channel may also be based on the media format of the status content of the status and or priority of status. For example a message of an emergency type and or high priority may be determined to be sent over an emergency channel such as over a VOIP and or Private Branch Exchange PBX phone channel to a telephone number. For example a text status may be converted to a voice status using a text to voice conversion and may be sent use a PBX system. Other relevant information such as location time or the like associated with the device may also be sent with the status. Processing next continues to block .

At block the status is modified based on the other channel. In one embodiment the status may be received as a first media format. The first media format may be appropriate for communication over the channel used by the user to send the status. The status may be converted into a second media format appropriate for communication over the other channel. For example the status may be received as HTML over an HTTP channel. The status may be converted into plain text e.g. removing tags . The plain text message may be sent over an SMS channel.

In general the determination of the second media format may be based on a variety of mechanisms and or factors. In one embodiment a media format may be based on a mapping e.g. pre defined mapping generated mapping etc between a type of channel and a media format. For example a mapping may associate a plain text format with an SMS channel an HTML format with an email channel a voice format with a VOIP channel a picture or image format with a channel enabled to send messages to a video enabled mobile device or the like. In one embodiment the status may be converted using a text to voice if the first media format is text and the second media format is voice. In one embodiment the status may be converted using a voice to text if the first media format is voice and the second media format is text. Processing next continues to block .

At block the status is modified based on a preference of the recipient. In one embodiment the received status may be modified from a received media format to another media format based on the preference. In one embodiment the recipient may indicate that the recipient wishes to receive media of a particular format status associated with a particular area of interest e.g. statuses with the keywords film or category of film or the like. In one embodiment the recipient may indicate that media of a particular format should be communicated over a particular type of channel. For example the recipient may indicate that the recipient wishes to receive voice statuses that were originally sent over a VOIP channel over an SMS channel. In another example the recipient may wish to receive all statuses over an IM channel and thus statuses are converted into a format suitable for IM e.g. plain text XML . In another example the status may be specified to be transcoded into a voice version. In another embodiment the user and or the recipient may specify that the status should also identify the channel over which the status was received. In general any number of rules criteria or conditions may be used to specify the preference of the recipients. In one embodiment the media format is include at least one of a text message format a voice message format an image format a video format a multimedia format or the like. Processing next continues to block .

At block the status is modified based on a relationship between the recipient and the user in the social network. In one embodiment the status is partitioned filtered based on a relationship between the user and the recipient in the social network. The status may be filtered based on a membership of the recipient and or the user in a group community in the social network

For example the status may be a composite status of at school bored math class see my blog post about math wherein the character represents a separator between statuses but in other embodiments other characters or separators may also be used. Each of the status may be associated with one format level of access or the like. The composite status may be partitioned into at school for those recipients in a general community of the social network at school bored for those recipients in a friends list of the user at school bored math class for those friends who are also in the same community associated with a same class as the user or the like. Moreover a recipient in a community about a special interest e.g. how to excel at math may receive only a particular type of status e.g. see my blog post about math .

In one embodiment the status may be a hierarchical status such as an ordered list tree or the like. Partitioning may comprise providing statuses from a level of the hierarchy of statuses based on a social network relationship between the user and the recipient. In one embodiment the level of the hierarchy may be determined based on an inverse relationship of the degree of separation.

For example a hierarchical status may be at school bored math class see my blog post about math. For one degree of separation recipients the level of the hierarchy may be determined to be 4 at school bored math class see my blog post about math. For two degrees the level may be determined to be 3 at school bored math class. For three degrees the level may be determined to be 2 at school bored. In any case processing next continues to block .

At block the status is modified based on information about a device to receive the status. In one embodiment the information may be converted into a media format appropriate for receipt by the device. For example an HTML status may be converted into WML before being sent to a mobile device. In another embodiment the status may be converted to take into account the location of the device. In one embodiment the location may be based on a GPS coordinate sent from the device an IP address of the device or the like. The status may be converted into a language specific to the location based on a machine translation technique for example. Moreover the status may include a time and or date converted into a local time for the device. The status may also include a distance from the user who sent the status and the device s location based on a distance measure e.g. Euclidian Manhattan distance . Processing then continues to block .

At block the status is sent to the recipient over the other channel. The status may be sent to the selected recipient using the specific protocol mechanism particular to the channel. For example an IM channel may use an IM client forwarder to send the status over an IM protocol. In one embodiment the status may be determined to be sent with a plurality of other statuses over a plurality of channels of the same type. In this embodiment the status may be sent using a multiplexed broadcasting mechanism wherein the status is sent in parallel in series or the like. Combining the sending of a plurality of statuses using a multiplexed broadcasting mechanism may reduce the overhead in initiating the protocol reduce other resource usages or the like. In some embodiments where the other channel supports multicasting the status may also be sent using various multicasting mechanisms including an IP multicasting broadcasting peercasting or the like. In one embodiment sending the status over the other channel may be delayed until the other channel is determined to be available. For example the other channel may be a mobile device. The channel may determined to be available if the mobile device is activated is within a certain range or the like.

In yet another embodiment sending the status may include sending a history of statuses e.g. the last N status . In one embodiment conflicting statuses may be filtered out based for example on a time of creation of the status. For example a more recent mood status of Happy may override an earlier mood of Sad. The history of statuses may be sent to the recipient over the other channel as described above. In any case processing then returns to a calling process for further processing.

In an alternate embodiment the status identity of the recipient type of channels determined in process or the like may be saved logged analyzed or the like. The saved information may be used to determine suggestions of for example possible recipients for a status or the like. Processing then continues to block .

Process begins after a start block at block where an input of a status of a user in a social network is received. The input may be entered using an application program on a client device such as one of client devices of for example. The user may enter text multimedia or the like to indicate the user s status. For example if the user is sad the user may select a sad face icon may take a picture of the user s face may record an audio version of I am sad or the like. The user may select a phrase image or the like from a selection list pull down list or the like. The list may be pre populated with previous entries the user and or members of the user s community have entered. In one embodiment the information is associated with the user e.g. the user s ID the client device . In any case after entry of the input the input is received by the client device. Process next continues to block .

At block a selection of a community in the social network is enabled. A list of the user s community may be provided on the client device. For example a phone list may be provided to the user on a mobile device. In another embodiment a graphical view of the social network showing for example hierarchical groups in the social network may be presented using for example a tree view or the like. The user is enabled to select the appropriate community using a variety of mechanisms including voice input key entry input touch screen input or the like. Processing then continues to block .

At block a recipient to receive the status is selected from the community. In one embodiment the user is enabled to select at least one of the recipient from the selected community. For example a contact list may be provided and the user may be enabled to select the recipient from the list using for example a scroll and select method a touch screen input a key entry input or the like. In one embodiment an identifier of the recipient is received by the client device. Processing next continues to block .

As shown blocks and or are optional and may not be performed. In this embodiment processing continues from block to block . In one embodiment the recipient is determined automatically as described in block of . In another embodiment a recipient from default list of recipients e.g. pre configured by the user may be used as the recipient.

At block the status is forwarded to the recipient over a plurality of channels wherein at least one of the plurality of channels is associated with the recipient. In one embodiment the status may be forwarded over a network to a status sharing server over a first channel. The server may select at least one other channel and may send the status to the recipient over the other channel. For example the client device may send the status over an IM protocol and the server e.g. SSS may send the status over an SMTP protocol to the recipient. The process for forwarding the status is described in more detail in process of above. In another embodiment the client device may send the status directly to the recipient over a plurality of channels. For example in one embodiment the client device may also act as a status sharing server and may select for example an IM channel and an SMS channel to send the status. The client device may send the status over the selected channels. Processing then returns to a calling process for further processing.

It should be noted that while process is described as operating on one recipient process may operate on a plurality of recipients without departing from the scope of the invention. For example at block a plurality of communities may be selected. At block a plurality of recipients may be selected. At block a status may be forwarded to a plurality of recipients over at least one channel. For example the status may be sent to a server over an IM channel. The status may then be sent to a first and second recipient over an SMS channel. Processing then continues as described above.
