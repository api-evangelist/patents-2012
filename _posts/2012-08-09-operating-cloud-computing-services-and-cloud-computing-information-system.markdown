The invention relates to a method for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network as well as a cloud computing information system.

Recently cloud computing has become a new computing paradigm. A generally accepted definition of cloud computing and cloud computing services can be described as follows Cloud computing services may be defined as consumer and business products services and solutions delivered and consumed in real time over the Internet. Typically cloud services are offered as shared services under a virtualised management and accessible over the Internet by people and or other services via Internet standards. Additionally cloud services delivered as consumer and or business products meet the following key attributes the services are shared meaning that there is a one to many relationship. The services are built for a market of consumers and not just a single customer irrespective of his nature as a private or business customer. Secondly the solutions are packaged meaning that they are turn key offerings integrating required resources. Thirdly they are accessible via the Internet meaning that they can be accessed by a ubiquitous but authorized network access. Fourthly the cloud services comprise the concept of self service provisioning meaning that in many if not in most cases an intuitive not hard to handle user interface is available in order to consume the cloud computing services. Fifthly cloud computing services are dynamic and fine grained or elastic meaning that the service provisioning scales with the number of users accessing the cloud services. Sixthly the concept of cloud computing relies on a user based and or user oriented pricing model meaning that a utilization and cost tracking is provided based on individual usage. Seventhly cloud computing services are using a standard based user interface meaning that typically a Web browser or a successor may be used for accessing the cloud services. Lastly cloud services provide published program and or services interfaces meaning that they are mainly based on Web services application programming interfaces API .

Cloud computing systems provide computing data and application services of different kind public cloud computing systems and private cloud computing systems.

A public cloud computing system is operated by a provider which offers cloud computing services to consumer or business users. A trivial cloud computing service can be a plain computing system or data processing system with an operating system. The consumer either an individual private user or a business user may use this computing system to install his own application and use it. Another cloud computing service may be a Web service where the cloud computing service provider provides a computer with an operating system and Web server software installed which the consumer may use. Yet another example for a cloud computing service is a storage service wherein the cloud computing service provider provides a storage system accessible via the Internet or a dedicated network line by the consumer with one or multiple interface protocols such as NFS CIFS FTP HTTP and WebDAV which the consumer may use to store data. Even complex services like a customer relationship management system composed of multiple applications providing one or more interfaces may be seen as a service provided out of a cloud computing environment.

In contrast to a public cloud computing system a private cloud computing system is designed for and access restricted to a single enterprise or a so called extended enterprise which includes also partner enterprises. In a private cloud computing system there are internally shared resources in form of cloud computing services and not a commercial offering to the public market.

Thus the concept of cloud computing systems relies on the Internet or connectivity via the same Internet protocols being used via dedicated lines. Typical cloud computing systems comprise cloud computing nodes providing cloud computing services cloud computing networks consumer interfaces one or more external networks via which the consumer workstation may be connected to cloud computing nodes in the form of data processing systems or simply to the cloud and monitoring and management components.

Cloud computing nodes are essentially computing systems or data processing systems which are configured with software programs such as an operating system and applications providing cloud computing services. Cloud computing services are typically represented by software. Cloud computing nodes may also comprise data storage systems which may be included in the cloud node or which may be externally attached to one or more cloud computing nodes e.g. via a storage area network SAN .

Cloud computing networks may be used to connect cloud computing nodes among each other for internal cloud processing. Cloud computing networks are closed networks within the cloud system and not visible to the consumer. Cloud computing networks may for example be based on Ethernet or fibre channel. A plurality of cloud computing networks may exist in a cloud computing system. Consumer interfaces may be interfaces over which the consumer can access the cloud services. An interface may be a protocol which runs on a certain hardware. There are different types of interfaces which are determined by the cloud service provided by the cloud computing node. For example a cloud computing node which provides a Web server service for a Web services interface may be based on Ethernet and TCP IP.

Another cloud computing node may provide a plain operating system with an interface based on SSH via Ethernet or TCP IP. External networks are used by computing systems of the consumer either private or within an enterprise to access the cloud computing services via the consumer interface. External networks do not have access to internal networks. The consumer of cloud computing services may access the cloud computing services and or applications via a Web browser or another application via an API. An example of a Web browser delivered cloud computing service would be a geographic routing service. Access via a non visual software component is also possible.

By using virtualization technologies a cloud computing node represented as hardware may contain a large number of virtualized data processing systems. Larger cloud computing networks may consist of hundreds of thousands of virtualized nodes running on tens of thousands of physical cloud computing nodes in the form of data processing systems. In principle the size of a cloud or a cloud computing network is not limited.

Monitoring and management components are available to obtain the software levels of operating systems and applications in addition to the hardware and firmware levels and details for each cloud computing node and store these in a database typically called configuration management database CMDB . Furthermore monitoring systems comprise methods to collect status and error information for each cloud node building the hardware and software stack. Management components allow monitoring operating and changing of a configuration of individual cloud computing nodes in cloud computing network or networks.

Hardware and software components building up a hardware and software stack can change for various reasons like introducing maintaining increasing decreasing and removing services and resources. Such a stack may consist of multiple components leading to a very high number of possible configurations kept in the CMDB.

If in a business to business B2B environment cloud computing services are used they are either used by individual end users of the enterprise or by the IT department of the enterprise. In contrast to individual consumers enterprises are defining security policies on confidentiality of their business data their IT business processes their statistical data like utilization of their IT applications and services their hardware and software being used and all information of the enterprise itself. Even in this case there will be a mixture of classical IT operations that deploy hardware and software systems inside an enterprise by its own IT centre and externally provided cloud computing services by a cloud computing provider. By moving applications or parts thereof into a public or private cloud enterprises may take advantage by changing their related security policies on such information and data.

Based on the above there may be a need for improving knowledge about cloud computing services configurations hardware and software stack configurations experiences made with cloud computing systems and other framing parameters related to cloud computing systems.

This need may be addressed by a method for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network a cloud computing information system for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network and a related data processing program and a related computer program product.

According to a first aspect there is provided a method for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network comprising collecting node status information indicative of a configuration of a cloud computing node from the cloud computing node wherein the cloud computing node is connected to the cloud computing network collecting cloud computing service status information indicative of an attribute of a cloud computing service being executed in the cloud computing node collecting environmental data sets from a plurality of computing systems each environmental data set corresponding to attribute values of one of the plurality of computing systems wherein the computing systems are connected to a network which is connected to the cloud computing network building a group of computing systems wherein the group consists of computing systems of the plurality of computing systems with at least one identical attribute value storing the node status information the cloud service status information the environmental data sets and the identical attribute value of each computing system of the group in a database and responsive to a request for characteristic data requested from one computing system of the same group selecting the respective characteristic data out of the node status information the cloud service status information and the environmental data sets in the database and sending the respective characteristic data over the cloud computing network and the network to the one computing system of the plurality of computing systems having requested the characteristic data.

Cloud computing nodes may essentially be computing systems which are configured with software programs such as operating systems middleware and application programs providing cloud computing services. Cloud computing nodes may also comprise data storage systems which may be included in the cloud computing node or which may be attached externally to the cloud computing node via e.g. a storage area network SAN .

Cloud computing services may denote services being provided by a cloud computing node. Cloud computing services are typically represented by software. Cloud computing services may relate to one or more of the as a Service concept like Software as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS Storage as a Service StaaS or Infrastructure as a Service IaaS .

A cloud computing network may denote two or more cloud computing nodes being connected by a network. Such a network may typically be based on the Ethernet protocol. Other network topologies or protocols are also possible. A cloud computing network may also be provided by a single cloud computing node.

A consumer of a cloud computing service may denote an end user as employee or otherwise related to an enterprise or an individual user like a private user or a user from a small business. Consumers access cloud computing services via consumer interfaces. Consumer interfaces may denote interfaces over which the consumer may access a cloud computing service. An interface may be a protocol which runs on a certain hardware. There are different types of interfaces which are determined by the cloud computing service provider for the cloud node. For example a cloud computing node which may provide a Web server service has a Web services interface based on Ethernet protocols and TCP IP.

Node status information may denote any information about a configuration of a cloud computing node. This may include information about capacity I O sub system the complete software stack including the operating system middleware and applications the usage of the cloud computing node an error log information about the location of the cloud computing node and the associated data information about the owner of the data of the cloud computing node and or access statistics about the cloud computing node.

Cloud service status information may denote one or more attributes of a cloud computing service that is executed in one cloud computing node. Such cloud service status information may comprise all available information and data about a cloud service e.g. the capability of a cloud computing service a version number an identifier of the cloud computing service usage data about the cloud service and potential error log data information about the service provider of the cloud computing service a cloud computing service price and or an enterprise identifier denoting an enterprise which computing system accesses a specific cloud service.

An environmental data set may denote one or more attribute values of computing systems or a larger group of computing systems within a computing centre of an enterprise which is connected via a network e.g. the Internet to the cloud computing network. A hardware interface between the network to which the computing system is linked and the cloud computing network may be provided. The attribute values may comprise information about the individual computing system accessing the cloud computing node in the cloud computing network and consuming cloud computing services but also a series of information about the cloud computing technical environment itself. This may also include information about the company operating the computing system or the industry or sub industry of the enterprise operating the computing system specifically used technical processes for operating a computing environment or an IT centre within the enterprise or other relevant data that may be of interest to other enterprises. This information may also comprise total revenue of an enterprise number of employees of the enterprise number of employees in the IT centre of the enterprise or other key parameters of the enterprise operating the computing system.

A request for characteristic data may denote a computer command sent from one computing system of the plurality of computing systems via the network and via the cloud computing network to one of the cloud computing nodes requesting specified data about a cloud computing node in the form of node status information a service in form of cloud service status information or a subset of cloud service status information of one service or a collection of cloud service status information from several cloud computing services. The request may also aim for having data returned from a cloud computing information system having stored environmental data sets as described above. Once the data have been identified as requested the data are sent via the cloud computing network and the network to the requesting computing system of the plurality of computing systems. The request may be based on an individual end user input or on a program running either on one of the computing systems in the computing centre of an enterprise operating the one computing system of the plurality of computing systems.

An advantage of the method for operating cloud computing services and a cloud computing network may be in sharing information among a group of computing systems and its users about services consumed from the cloud computing network and also in sharing information about the computing system and its environment itself. This way interest groups may be formed among enterprises belonging to the same vertical industry e.g. the chemical industry the automotive industry the retail industry the healthcare industry or public services organizations.

In the following further exemplary embodiments of the method for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network will be described. However these embodiments also apply for the inventive cloud computing information system for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network.

In one embodiment the node status information may comprise one of the group consisting of node software stack data node hardware configuration data node usage data node error log node location data and node access statistics data. In particular any combination of individual node status information data may be possible. The node status information may comprise in particular all data that is collected and managed about the operation of a computing system in form of a cloud computing node by a systems management tool. The node hardware configuration data may comprise the manufacturer name of the computer an internal memory capacity an external or bulk memory capacity peripheral devices being attached to the computer and or the age of the computing system. The node software stack data may denote cloud computing node information about the software being installed on the cloud computing node hardware. This may comprise a description and or a name of an operating system version and release numbers as well as patch information information about middleware like databases or application servers network software programming environments and other utility programs commonly known as middleware. Additionally the node software stack data may comprise information about application software and interfaces for any of the installed components of the software stack. The node status information may also comprise information about any virtualization layers on the cloud computing node. Node usage data may comprise information about the usage of an individual cloud computing node in the form of actual capacity over time compared to the total capacity of the computing system of the cloud computing node.

Node error log information may denote any information about past errors that happened to the hardware configuration or to the node software stack. A node location information or node location data may denote physical location of a cloud computing node. This may include country information and or other geographic information like a physical address in a city.

Node owner data or node owner information may comprise information about the provider of the cloud computing node. Node access statistic data may comprise information about an access to the cloud computing node over time.

In particular a combination of more than one or even all of the parameters relating to node status information may actually be used in an embodiment.

In another embodiment the cloud computing service status information may comprise one of the group consisting of a cloud service identifier a cloud service version a cloud service capability cloud service usage data cloud service error log data cloud service provider identification and context information cloud service price and an enterprise identifier wherein the enterprise identifier corresponds to a computing system of the plurality of computing systems. In particular the cloud service status information may also be a combination of any attributes listed above.

This may deliver the cloud computing service provider as well as consumers or users of cloud computing services detailed information about a cloud service being provided. In particular a computing system representing an access by an end user of an enterprise via a network and via the cloud computing network to an individual cloud computing service may be provided with a wide variety of information about a specific cloud computing service. An end user accessing this information by the computing system of the plurality of computing systems may decide whether a specific cloud computing service may be of any help to his enterprise.

In yet another embodiment one individual environmental data set or more generally the environmental data sets may comprise at least one attribute out of the group consisting of an enterprise identifier a country identifier a virtual industry identifier a business unit identifier the number of employees of the enterprise running the computing system revenue of the enterprise number of business transactions organizational structure storage I O throughput number of transaction on databases number of end users CPU utilization storage consumption error log information attributes of processes used hardware configurations firmware levels software configurations and process templates. In particular the environmental data sets may not just comprise one attribute but any combination out of the attributes listed above.

Such set of information could be used to describe large parts of the computing environment of a particular enterprise as well as other characteristic data of an enterprise like revenue and number of employees. Access to any of these attribute values may be restricted in such a way that access to these attribute values might be given to users of other computing systems belonging to the same group. This way interest groups for example of enterprises belonging to the same vertical industry may be formed. It may also be possible to form interest groups using a specific application program. If in particular also marketing data sales information like revenue data information about research and development information about an enterprise s service and support organization are accessible by members of a group joint interests may be followed providing a potential competitive advantage over other enterprises not allowing access of a cloud computing information system to their data.

According to another embodiment the method may further comprise responsive to a generate new service request from one computing system belonging to the group delivering of decision support data indicative of a best match between attributes of existing cloud computing services being executed in a cloud computing node of a cloud computing network and attributes of a new service being specified by the generate new service request wherein the existing cloud computing service is used by a computing system of the group.

In other words a user of a computing system of the plurality of computing systems of the group may inform himself about existing cloud services being available in the cloud computing network. He may specify a new service that may be consumed by the computing system of the enterprise of the user. Based on these specification data wherein specific attributes of a new cloud computing service are given individual values a cloud information system of the cloud computing network may send information about cloud services that already are executed or available on one of the cloud computing nodes matching the attribute values. In particular cloud computing services used by the group may be given a priority.

If no direct or complete match may have been found within the group the cloud computing information system may in particular determine a match with an existing cloud computing service from another group. If also there no direct or complete match may have been found the cloud computing information system may determine a best match between the specified attributes of a new cloud computing service and all available cloud computing services.

A best match may be determined by a highest number of identical attribute values between the specified attribute values and those of available cloud computing services. The cloud information system may inform the consumer about differences and list several potential available cloud computing services that come closest to the specified attributes. Other matching priorities may be defined.

In an alternative embodiment of the method for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network the method may further comprise responsive to a generate new service request from one computing system automatically generating a new cloud computing service to be performed in the cloud computing node based on the cloud service status information in the database and attributes of the new service being specified by the generate new service request. In particular the new service may be generated based on an existing cloud computing service already used by another computing system of the group.

If no match may be found also cloud computing services from another group may be used as a basis. Such a mechanism may decrease dramatically the time for setting up and configuring new cloud services because an identical equivalent or similar cloud service request may have been generated previously from another computing system of the plurality of computing systems representing another enterprise belonging to the same group.

It should be noted that the group wherein each individual computing system may belong to another enterprise may also define a group of enterprises belonging to the same group. In this sense the computing systems and the enterprises may be used in an exchangeable manner.

In alternative embodiment of the method for operating cloud computing services the method may further comprise determining a number of cloud computing nodes executing a predefined version of a predefined software component specified in the node software stack configuration data as part of a cloud computing service for a computing system of the group. In particular the determined number or a related percentage value may be sent on request to the computing systems of the group. The number may in particular be sent to the computing systems of the group if a trigger level is exceeded. This trigger level may have been set by a computing system of the group. This enables a user of the computing system to monitor whether a certain software version is used by a minority or majority of the user of the group.

In yet another embodiment of the method for operating cloud computing services the method may further comprise if the number exceeds a specified trigger level and if an actual version of the predefined software component is lower than the predefined version installing the predefined version of the predefined software component on a cloud computing node executing a cloud computing service for the computing system of the group for which the specified trigger level is defined. This allows a user of the group to set a trigger level in a way to ensure that the predefined software component is also used for the cloud computing service he is using. A user of a computing system being careful may only use the next version of a software component if a majority of e.g. 70 is already using it. A more progressive user of the computing system may decide to use the software component if only 30 of his peers are using it.

In another exemplary embodiment of the cloud computing information system for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network the cloud computing information system may comprise additionally a user interface at one of the plurality of computing systems adopted for allowing a user action out of the group consisting of joining the group deciding on sharing parts of the one of the individual data sets corresponding to attribute values of the one computing system of the plurality of computing systems introducing a process of a process template library utilizing a process of a process template library modifying the process of a process template library searching through group attributes sorting and displaying of the group and group attributes values based on user defined criteria.

An advantage of such an embodiment of the cloud computing information system may be that a user or consumer being represented by one computing system of the plurality of computing systems may inform himself about the computing context of peers in his group provided that the peers have granted access to the related information attribute values. Such a mechanism may provide even better support for exchanging information for building joined interest groups across enterprise borders.

It should be noted that the invention may take the form of an entirely hardware implementation and entirely software embodiment or embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In a preferred embodiment the invention is implemented in software which includes but is not limited to firmware resident software and microcode.

In one embodiment a data processing program for execution in a data processing system is provided comprising software code portions for performing the method as described above when the program is run on a computer.

Furthermore the invention may take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer usable or computer readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purpose of this document a computer usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that may contain store communicate propagate or transport the program for use by or in a connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device.

In another embodiment a computer program product stored on a computer usable medium is provided comprising computer readable program means for causing a computer to perform the method as described above when the program is run on the computer.

The medium may be an electronic magnetic optical electromagnetic infrared or a semi conductor system for a propagation medium. Examples of a computer readable medium include a semi conductor or solid state memory magnetic tape a removable computer diskette a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM a rigid magnetic disc and an optical disc. Current examples of optical discs include compact disc read only memory CD ROM compact disc read write CD R W DVD and Blue Ray Disc.

It should also be noted that embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to different subject matters. In particular some embodiments have been described with reference to method type claims whereas other embodiments have been described with reference to apparatus type claims. However a person skilled in the art will gather from the above and the following description that unless otherwise notified in addition to any combination of features belonging to one type of subject matter also any combination between features relating to different subject matters in particular between features of the method type claims and features of the apparatus type claims is considered as to be disclosed within this document.

The aspects defined above and further aspects of present invention are apparent from the examples of embodiment to be described hereinafter and are explained with reference to the examples of embodiment. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to examples of embodiment but to which the invention is not limited.

In the following a detailed description of the drawings will be given. All illustrations in the drawings are schematic. Firstly a conventional computing system will be described. Afterwards the inventive method for operating cloud computing services in a cloud computing network with a cloud computing information system will be described.

If the cloud computing network is not operated as a public cloud but instead as a private cloud network may not be the public Internet but a private network inside an enterprise. In this case the computing systems may denote specific computing systems for individual business units of the enterprise or for individual subsidiaries in different geographic locations of the enterprise. In the case of a private cloud an enterprise identifier may be used as an identifier for a division or business unit of the enterprise. In the case of a public cloud the enterprise identifier may denote the enterprise itself.

Part of the cloud information system which also may be implemented in form of software is a database. This database may store information about the cloud computing nodes the cloud computing services as well as information about the plurality of computing systems . Sub groups of the computing systems may form interest groups because they belong for example to enterprises that belong to the same vertical industry.

A user of an enterprise using one of the computers using a standard I O devices like a keyboard and a computer screen may decide to share information about his own company with those of other companies. He may instruct the cloud information system to collect environmental data of a computing system representing an enterprise. Such environmental data sets are stored in the database of the cloud computing information system. If another user of another company also decides to share environmental data of its own computing system also this information is stored in the database of the cloud computing information system. Computing systems belonging to the same group may each have access to the environmental data set of other peer members in the group. It may be possible that one enterprise represented by one computing system may join different groups at the same time. The information about the environmental data of the computer system may vary from group to group.

Furthermore the cloud information system comprises a group building unit which is adapted for building a group of computing systems wherein the group comprises computing systems of the plurality of computing systems with at least one identical attribute value. Such an identical attribute value may for example be the vertical industry to which the enterprise belongs which is operating the computing system . All these data collected by the first collection unit the second collection unit the third collection unit as well as the information related to the group from the group building unit is stored inside the cloud computing information system in a storage unit which comprises a database .

Furthermore the cloud computing information system comprises a selection unit which is adapted for selecting characteristic data out of the node status information the cloud service status information and the environmental data sets in the database and sending the characteristic data over the cloud computing network and the network to the one computing system of the plurality of computing systems having requested the characteristic data in response to a request for characteristic data from one computing system . Again also here the computing systems represent each an individual enterprise or a complete data centre of an enterprise. The selection unit operates on the basis of information provided by the computer system as part of the request and selects appropriate data out of the database of the storage unit of the cloud computing system . These data that correspond to the request being sent from the computer system is sent by the cloud information system using conventional methods and devices via the cloud computing network the interface between the cloud computing network and the network as well via the network e.g. the Internet back to the requesting computing system .

Finally it should be noted that the above mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention and that those skilled in the art would be capable of designing many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In the claims any reference signs placed in parenthesis shall not be construed as limiting the claims. The word comprising and comprises and the like does not exclude the presence of elements or steps rather than those listed in any claims or the specification as a whole. A singular reference of an element does not exclude the plural reference of such elements and vice versa. In a device claim enumerating several means several of these means may be embodied by one and the same item of software or hardware. The mere fact that the certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to an advantage.
