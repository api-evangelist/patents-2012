The present application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 589 067 filed on Jan. 20 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Frequency dividers are widely used as key building blocks in Phase Locked Loops PLLs . Frequency dividers are configured to provide signals of frequencies different from the frequency of a clock signal to thereby reduce speed and simplify digital circuitry. Several characteristics of a frequency divider include speed performance duty cycle rail to rail clock output etc.

It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. The inventive concept may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this description will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the inventive concept to those of ordinary skill in the art. It will be apparent however that one or more embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.

In the drawings the thickness and width of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements. The elements and regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and thus relative sizes or intervals illustrated in the figures are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concept.

In the flip flop circuit the first output Q is coupled to the second input DB and the second output QB is coupled to the first input D. The first and second switches S S are coupled in series between the first input D and the first output Q. The first intermediate node N is positioned between the first and second switches S S. The second intermediate node N is positioned between the second switch S and the first output Q. The third and fourth switches S S are coupled in series between the second input DB and the second output QB. The third intermediate node N is positioned between the third and fourth switches S S. The fourth intermediate node N is positioned between the fourth switch S and the second output QB.

The first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG is coupled between the first and third intermediate nodes N N. The second cross coupled gates arrangement CCG is coupled between the second and fourth intermediate nodes N N. As used herein a cross coupled gates arrangement includes a pair of semiconductor devices each of which has an input coupled to an output of the other semiconductor device and vice versa. Examples of semiconductor devices include but are not limited to logic gates. Examples of logic gates include but are not limited to AND gate OR gate NOT gate inverter NAND gate NOR gate XNOR gate etc. In some embodiments each logic gate includes a combination of other logic gates. In some embodiments each semiconductor device in a cross coupled gates arrangement includes a combination of logic gates. In some embodiments each cross coupled gates arrangement includes a latch.

The first and third switches S S are configured to be closed in response to a first level e.g. a HIGH or H level of a clock signal CK and opened in response to a second level e.g. a LOW or L level of the clock signal CK. The second and fourth switches S S are configured to be opened in response to the first level of the clock signal CK and closed in response to the second level of the clock signal CK.

The signal levels at the first intermediate node N and third intermediate node N are maintained or latched from the first time period t to a subsequent second time period t by the first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG coupled between the first and third intermediate nodes N N.

During the second time period t i.e. at the second level e.g. L of the clock signal CK the first switch S and the third switch S are opened while the second switch S and the fourth switch S are closed. The first intermediate node N is connected via the second intermediate node N to the first output Q and the third intermediate node N is connected via the fourth intermediate node N to the second output QB. The corresponding signal levels H and L of the first intermediate node N and third intermediate node N which were latched by the first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG are thus transferred to the first output Q and second output QB and switch the signal level at the first output Q from L to H and the signal level at the second output QB from H to L.

The signal levels at the second intermediate node N and fourth intermediate node N are maintained or latched from the second time period t to a subsequent third time period t by the second cross coupled gates arrangement CCG coupled between the second and fourth intermediate nodes N N. Thus the signal levels at the first output Q and second output QB are also maintained by the second cross coupled gates arrangement CCG from the second time period t to the third time period t.

During the third time period t i.e. at the first level e.g. H of the clock signal CK the first switch S and the third switch S are closed while the second switch S and the fourth switch S are opened. The second output QB is connected via the first input D to the first intermediate node N and the first output Q is connected via the second input DB to the third intermediate node N. The corresponding signal levels H and L of the first output Q and second output QB which were latched by the second cross coupled gates arrangement CCG are thus transferred to the first intermediate node N and third intermediate node N and switch the signal level at the first intermediate node N from H to L and the signal level at the third intermediate node N from L to H.

The signal levels at the first intermediate node N and third intermediate node N are maintained or latched from the third time period t to a subsequent fourth time period t by the first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG coupled between the first and third intermediate nodes N N.

During the fourth time period t i.e. at the second level e.g. L of the clock signal CK the first switch S and the third switch S are opened while the second switch S and the fourth switch S are closed. The first intermediate node N is connected via the second intermediate node N to the first output Q and the third intermediate node N is connected via the fourth intermediate node N to the second output QB. The corresponding signal levels L and H of the first intermediate node N and third intermediate node N which were latched by the first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG are thus transferred to the first output Q and second output QB and switch the signal level at the first output Q from H to L and the signal level at the second output QB from L to H.

As can be seen intrinsic frequency B the output signals of the flip flop circuit at the first output Q and second output QB follow the input clock signal CK at a frequency being half of the frequency of the clock signal CK. The flip flop circuit operates as a divide by two DIV2 frequency divider. In some embodiments more than one flip flop circuits are coupled in series cascades to obtain a frequency divisor of four eight etc. In some embodiments a frequency divisor other than two four or eight etc. is also obtainable by various techniques known or to be developed in the art.

In some embodiments the clock signal CK and or an inverted clock signal CKB is are applied to each of the first through fourth switches S S to control the switches to open or close as described above. The inverted clock signal CKB is an inverted signal of the clock signal and is also interchangeably referred to herein as C .

In some embodiments where only the clock signal CK or only the inverted clock signal CKB is applied to each of the first through fourth switches S S the flip flop circuit is referred to as a flip flop circuit with single end input clock. Each of the first through fourth switches S S is implemented by any electronic switching device controllable by the clock signal CK or inverted clock signal CKB. In some embodiments the first through fourth switches S S include one or more PMOS and or NMOS transistors the gates of which are coupled to receive the clock signal CK or inverted clock signal CKB. For example the first switch S and third switch S are NMOS transistors which are turned ON or closed in response to the H level of the clock signal CK applied thereto whereas the second switch S and fourth switch S are PMOS transistors are turned ON or closed in response to the L level of the clock signal CK applied thereto. The turning ON or OFF of a PMOS or NMOS transistor depends on the threshold voltage thereof i.e. an NMOS transistor is turned ON when the signal level of the clock signal CK is at or higher than the threshold voltage of the NMOS transistor whereas a PMOS transistor is turned ON when the signal level of the clock signal CK is at or lower than the threshold voltage of the PMOS transistor. As a result the flip flop circuit with single end input clock under certain circumstances e.g. at a low supply voltage exhibits a slower than expected speed due to the threshold voltages of the PMOS or NMOS transistors defining the first through fourth switches S S.

In some embodiments speed improvement is obtainable by applying both the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB to at least one of the first through fourth switches S S. In this case the flip flop circuit is referred to as a flip flop circuit with differential input clock. In some embodiments both the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB are applied to each of the first through fourth switches S S. Each of the first through fourth switches S S which is configured to receive both the clock signal CK and inverted clock signal CKB is implemented by any electronic switching device having multiple control terminals.

In some embodiments the third switch S when configured to receive both the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB is implemented by a transmission gate TG similar to that of the first switch S. The second switch S and or fourth switch S when configured to receive both the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB is implemented by a transmission gate TG which is different from the transmission gate TG of the first switch S in that the positive control terminal is connected to receive the inverted clock signal CKB and the negative control terminal is connected to receive the clock signal CK.

In some embodiments the flip flop circuit with differential input clock is configured to receive both the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB from external circuitry. In some embodiments the flip flop circuit with differential input clock is configured to receive one of the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB and to internally generate the other clock signal e.g. by way of an inverter such as the inverter INV .

The flip flop circuit further includes first through fourth inverters INV INV. The first inverter INV is coupled between the first intermediate node N and the second switch S. The second inverter INV is coupled between the second intermediate node N and the first output Q. The third inverter INV is coupled between the third intermediate node N and the fourth switch S. The fourth inverter INV is coupled between the fourth intermediate node N and the second output QB. A fifth intermediate node N is positioned between the first inverter INV and the second switch S. A sixth intermediate node N is positioned between the third inverter INV and the fourth switch S.

In the flip flop circuit the first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG includes first and second logic gates G G and the second cross coupled gates arrangement CCG includes third and fourth logic gates G G. The first logic gate G includes a first input coupled to an output of the second logic gate G and also to the third intermediate node N. The second logic gate G includes a first input coupled to an output of the first logic gate G and also to the first intermediate node N. The third logic gate G includes a first input coupled to an output of the fourth logic gate G and also to the fourth intermediate node N. The fourth logic gate G includes a first input coupled to an output of the third logic gate G and also to the second intermediate node N.

One of the first and second logic gates e.g. the second logic gate G includes a second input coupled to a node TIEL of a predetermined logic level. For example in the specific embodiment illustrated in where the second logic gate G is a NOR gate the node TIEL is a tied low node which is tied to a low voltage corresponding to a LOW logic level. In one or more embodiments the node TIEL is either grounded or connected to a ground voltage terminal VSS via a tie low circuit. With a LOW signal from the node TIEL at one of the inputs of the NOR gate G the output third intermediate node N is switched by and inverted from the logic level at the other input first intermediate node N .

Similarly one of the third and fourth logic gates e.g. the third logic gate G includes a second input coupled to a node TIEL of a predetermined logic level e.g. the LOW level .

The other of the first and second logic gates e.g. the first logic gate G includes a second input which is coupled to a reset input REST to receive a reset signal for resetting the flip flop circuit . Similarly the other of the third and fourth logic gates e.g. the fourth logic gate G includes a second input which is coupled to the reset input REST to receive the reset signal. In some embodiments the reset signal is a system reset signal and or an error reset signal. The system reset signal is supplied by external circuitry. The error reset signal is supplied by an error detection circuit as described below.

Normally the reset signal is at a LOW level the output first intermediate node N of the first logic gate G is switched by and inverted from the logic level at the first input third intermediate node N and the output fourth intermediate node N of the fourth logic gate G is switched by and inverted from the logic level at the first input second intermediate node N . If the reset signal at a HIGH level is applied to the reset input REST the output first intermediate node N of the first logic gate G is reset to the LOW level logical zero the output fourth intermediate node N of the fourth logic gate G is reset to the LOW level logical zero and the flip flop circuit is reset.

In some embodiments logic gates other than NOR gates e.g. inverters or NAND gates are used as one or more of the first through fourth logic gates G G. Depending on the particular type of logic gate being used the node TIEL of any or both of the first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG and second cross coupled gates arrangement CCG is a tied high node. In some embodiments the reset signal and or the system reset signal and or the error reset signal is a normally HIGH signal.

The flip flop circuits in accordance with some embodiments specifically described herein are D flip flop circuits. Other types of flip flop circuits are usable in further embodiments. In some embodiments the entire flip flop circuit is manufactured by CMOS technology.

The flip flop circuits in accordance with some embodiments achieve a 50 or substantially 50 duty cycle which is advantageous in certain applications where double edge sampling is used.

The flip flop circuits in accordance with some embodiments achieve a full swing clock output at the first output Q and second output QB with the output voltage swings rail to rail i.e. from a power supply voltage VDD to a ground voltage VSS . In cases where a full swing clock output is not provided although the speed performance is improvable the small swing of the clock output makes it harder for the following circuits to use the clock output. To the contrary flip flop circuits in accordance with some embodiments achieve a full swing clock output which is usable without difficulty by the following circuits without sacrificing or significantly limiting the speed performance.

The flip flop circuits in accordance with some embodiments are implementable in a wide range of frequency e.g. from 0 to 20 GHz is suitable for System on Chip SOC and ultra high frequency testing applications.

The flip flop circuits in accordance with some embodiments are implementable as static flip flop circuits with differential input clock with an improved speed performance over flip flop circuits with single end input clock.

The flip flop circuits in accordance with some embodiments include a relatively low number of internal nodes and or induce a relatively small delay. For example in the flip flop circuit of there are three intermediate nodes e.g. N N and N in the current path from one input e.g. the first input D to the corresponding to output e.g. the first output Q . The relatively low number e.g. two of inverters INV INV or INV INV also induces a relatively small delay.

In a flip flop circuit with differential input clock such as the flip flop circuit in a steady error state is a possibility when the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB have the same level due to various factors and or under certain operating conditions. Specifically when the clock signal CK is the same as the inverted clock signal CKB all four switches S S are closed at the same time causing a potential steady error state where the first input D the second input DB the first intermediate node N the third intermediate node N the first output Q and the second output QB are all at the HIGH level logical 1 whereas the second intermediate node N and the fourth intermediate node N are both at the LOW level logical zero . The flip flop circuit stays in the steady error state until being reset.

The error detection circuit is provided to detect a potential steady error state and reset the differential flip flop circuit when such a steady error state is detected. Specifically the error detection circuit includes a first input coupled to the first output Q of the differential flip flop circuit a second input coupled to the second output QB of the differential flip flop circuit and an output coupled to an input of an OR gate . Another input of the OR gate is coupled to receive a System Reset signal. An output of the OR gate is coupled to the reset terminal REST of the differential flip flop circuit . The OR gate combines the System Reset signal with an error reset signal generated by the error detection circuit and applies a reset signal to the reset terminal REST of the differential flip flop circuit when any one or both of the System Reset signal and the error reset signal is are present at the corresponding inputs of the OR gate . In some embodiments the System Reset signal is omitted and the error reset signal is applied directly from the error detection circuit to the reset terminal REST of the differential flip flop circuit without the intermediary of the OR gate . The error detection circuit is configured to generate the error reset signal to reset the differential flip flop circuit upon a determination that the first and second outputs Q QB of the differential flip flop circuit are at the same signal level which indicates that a steady error state potentially exists . In one or more embodiments the error detection circuit compares the first output Q and second output QB and generates the rest signal when the comparison indicates that Q QB.

A specific implementation of the error detection circuit in accordance with some embodiments is described with respect to which is schematic circuit diagram of a frequency divider . Similarly to the frequency divider the frequency divider includes the differential flip flop circuit and the error detection circuit . The error detection circuit in the frequency divider includes a comparator and a timer . The comparator coupled to the first and second inputs of the error detection circuit and configured to generate a comparison signal RST indicating whether or not the first and second outputs Q QB of the differential flip flop circuit are at the same signal level or not. In the specifically disclosed embodiment of the comparator is implemented by an XOR gate. However any other comparator configuration is usable in further embodiments.

The timer has an input coupled to an output of the comparator to receive therefrom the comparison signal RST. An output OUT of the timer defines the output of the error detection circuit . The timer is configured to send an error reset signal rstdiv via the output of the error detection circuit and the OR gate to the reset terminal REST of the differential flip flop circuit upon a determination that the first and second outputs Q QB of the differential flip flop circuit are at the same signal level over a predetermined time period. The predetermined time period is selected to avoid false alarm situations where signal fluctuations cause the clock signal CK and inverted clock signal CKB to be equal over a brief time period insufficient to result in a steady error state. In some embodiments the predetermined time period is determined by experiment or simulation or calculation etc.

The timer further includes a reference input configured to receive a series of reference pulses Tref for counting a time period during which the first and second outputs Q QB of the differential flip flop circuit are at the same signal level. When the counted time period reaches or exceeds the predetermined time period the timer issues the error reset signal rstdiv at the output . Other arrangements for the timer to determine whether the first and second outputs Q QB of the differential flip flop circuit are at the same signal level over the predetermined time period are implementable in further embodiments. In one or more embodiments the timer is omitted and the comparator issues the error reset signal rstdiv upon a determination that the first and second outputs Q QB of the differential flip flop circuit are at the same signal level.

After two periods of the clock signal CK the second output QB switches to the LOW level at 5 while the first output Q is also at the LOW level due to the same signal level of clock signal CK and inverted clock signal CKB. The comparator detects that Q QB and issues at 6 a comparison signal RST at the LOW level. The timer determines the time period during which the comparison signal RST remains at the LOW level which indicates Q QB . If the comparison signal RST returns to the HIGH level i.e. Q QB before the predetermined time period is reached no further reset signal is generated by the timer and the differential flip flop circuit operates normally as described with respect to .

However if the comparison signal RST remains at the LOW level for the counted time period at 7 equal to or greater than the predetermined time period set in the timer the timer issues at 8 an error reset signal rstdiv at the HIGH level which is applied to the reset terminal REST to reset the differential flip flop circuit again. The second output QB is raised to the HIGH level at 9 due to the reset terminal REST. The comparison signal RST returns to the HIGH level at 10 due to the difference between the first output Q LOW level and second output QB HIGH level . If CK CKB at this time the differential flip flop circuit operates normally as indicated at 11 14 . However if CK continues to be equal to CKB the actions described at 7 10 are repeated and the timer keeps resetting the differential flip flop circuit to bring the differential flip flop circuit out of the steady error state.

In some embodiments the error detection circuit is a built in circuit of the frequency divider . In other words the entire frequency divider including the differential flip flop circuit and the error detection circuit is incorporated in a single chip. The chip in some embodiments is entirely made by CMOS technology.

A skew may exist between the initial clock signal CKI and the initial inverted clock signal CKIB as illustrated in the top half of the timing diagram in . Specifically a rising edge of the initial clock signal CKI and a falling edge of the initial inverted clock signal CKIB due to various factors and or operating conditions may not occur at the same or substantially at the same time. In the specific situation illustrated in the rising edge of the initial clock signal CKI and the falling edge of the initial inverted clock signal CKIB are shifted in time relative to each other by about 25 of the clock period. If such a clock input with 25 skew is supplied to the differential flip flop circuit the speed performance and or duty cycle of the frequency divider will be significantly affected.

The deskewing circuit is configured to reduce the skew between the initial clock signal CKI and the initial inverted clock signal CKIB and to output the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB with the reduced skew to the differential flip flop circuit . Specifically as illustrated in the bottom half of the timing diagram in a rising edge of the clock signal CK at the output of the deskewing circuit and a falling edge of the inverted clock signal CKB at the output of the deskewing circuit occur at the same or substantially at the same time. In some embodiments skew between the clock signal CK and inverted clock signal CKB outputted by the deskewing circuit is not greater than 2 of the clock period. The duty cycle and or speed performance is thus improved when a deskewing circuit is placed upstream of the clock inputs of a differential flip flop circuit in accordance with some embodiments.

Each deskewing unit includes a first inverter coupled between a first input and a first output of the deskewing unit a second inverter coupled between a second input and a second output of the deskewing circuit and a pair of third and fourth inverters cross coupled between the outputs of the first and second inverters . The outputs of the first and second outputs also define the first and second outputs of the deskewing unit . The first and second outputs of a preceding deskewing unit are connected to the first and second inputs of the subsequent deskewing unit . The first and second inputs of the first deskewing unit define the first and second inputs of the deskewing circuit for receiving the initial clock signal CKI and the initial inverted clock signal CKIB. The first and second outputs of the last deskewing unit define the first and second outputs of the deskewing circuit from which the clock signal CK and inverted clock signal CKB are outputted to the differential flip flop circuit .

In each deskewing unit the inverters especially the cross coupled inverters are configured to reduce skew in the clock signal inputted into the deskewing unit . In some embodiments a desired skew reducing effect is obtained by appropriately sizing the cross coupled inverters relative to the other inverters . Any other deskewing unit configurations are usable in further embodiments. For example NAND gates are used in one or more embodiments to replace the inverters .

In some embodiments the deskewing circuit is a built in circuit of the frequency divider . In other words the entire frequency divider including the differential flip flop circuit the error detection circuit and the deskewing circuit is incorporated in a single chip. The chip in some embodiments is entirely made by CMOS technology.

In some embodiments the frequency divider or includes a plurality of cascades each comprising one differential flip flop circuit . In some embodiments the frequency divider further includes at least one error detection circuit coupled to the outputs of the differential flip flop circuit in one of the cascade. In some embodiments each cascade includes a separate error detection circuit . In some embodiments the frequency divider includes one deskewing circuit coupled to the clock inputs of the differential flip flop circuit of the first cascade.

At step in response to a first level of a clock signal an inverting output of a flip flop circuit is connected to a first intermediate node and a non inverting output of the flip flop circuit is connected to a second intermediate node. For example in the flip flop circuit of or the flip flop circuit of when the clock signal CK is at the HIGH level and or the inverted clock signal CKB is at the LOW level the inverting output QB of the flip flop circuit is connected via the non inverting input D to the first intermediate node N and the non inverting output Q of the flip flop circuit is connected via the inverting input DB to the third intermediate node N.

At step in response to a second level of the clock signal the first intermediate node is connected to the non inverting output and the second intermediate node is connected to the inverting output. For example in the flip flop circuit of or the flip flop circuit of when the clock signal CK is at the LOW level and or the inverted clock signal CKB is at the HIGH level the first intermediate node N is connected via the second intermediate node N to the non inverting output Q and the third intermediate node N is connected via the fourth intermediate node N to the inverting output QB.

As a result of the steps and by arranging the first cross coupled gates arrangement CCG between the first intermediate node N and third intermediate node N and the second cross coupled gates arrangement CCG between the second intermediate node N and fourth intermediate node N the frequency of the clock signal CK and or the inverted clock signal CKB is divided by 2 at the outputs of the flip flop circuit as described with respect to .

At step the first output Q and second output QB of the flip flop circuit are monitored and the flip flop circuit is reset upon a determination that the outputs Q and QB are at the same signal level over a predetermined time period. For example in the frequency divider of or the frequency divider of where the flip flop circuit is a differential flip flop circuit responsive to both the clock signal CK and the inverted clock signal CKB a steady error state caused by CK CKB may occur. By monitoring the first and second outputs Q QB of the flip flop circuit e.g. by a comparator described with respect to and resetting e.g. by a timer described with respect to the flip flop circuit upon a determination that a steady error state exists the steady error state of the frequency divider is eliminable as described with respect to . In some embodiments step is omitted.

Steps may be added replaced changed order and or eliminated as appropriate in accordance with the spirit and scope of embodiments of the disclosure. Embodiments that combine different features and or different embodiments are within scope of the disclosure and will be apparent to those skilled in the art after reviewing this disclosure.
