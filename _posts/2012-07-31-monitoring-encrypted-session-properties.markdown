Monitors can detect and monitor traffic on a computing network. The monitors can monitor traffic on a computing network to determine properties associated with the traffic. The traffic can include encrypted data and the monitor can decrypt the encrypted data to obtain properties associated with the portion of the traffic that includes encrypted data.

Applications can be utilized throughout various locations around the world by users on various networks e.g. wide area network WAN local area network LAN etc. . A user s computing device can utilize the various networks to perform various functions of applications e.g. communication with a server downloads updates etc. . While utilizing the various networks to perform various functions of the applications the data transferred between a user and an application on the various networks can include various session properties. A portion of the various session properties can be protected by encryption. For example the various session properties can be transferred in a secure sign on SSO token that includes an encrypted user name. An identity and access management IAM system can be used to protect the encrypted session properties of the data transferred between a user and an application on the various networks.

The session properties of the data transferred between a user and an application can be monitored. A monitor can use the session properties of the data transferred between the user and the application to determine metrics associated with the application s use. These metrics can be used to analyze and improve an application s functions.

Previous approaches of monitoring encrypted session properties included developing an application to decrypt the session properties using a software development kit SDK and or an application programming interface API of the IAM system that is protecting the encrypted session properties. Therefore the previous approaches of monitoring encrypted session properties included developing an application to decrypt session properties for each of the different IAM systems protecting encrypted session properties.

The present disclosure includes methods and systems for monitoring encrypted session properties. A number of embodiments include receiving a number of encrypted session properties at a real user monitor RUM on a real user monitoring RUM system and decrypting the number of encrypted session properties using an identity and access management IAM agent on the RUM system.

In a number of embodiments of the present disclosure an IAM agent of the IAM system protecting the encrypted session properties and a mirror application can be used to decrypt encrypted session properties and to provide decrypted session properties to the monitor that is monitoring the session properties transferred between a user and an application.
