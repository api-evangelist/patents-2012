title: Two-dimensional magneto-optical trap for neutral atoms
abstract: A two-dimensional (2D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) for alkali neutral atoms establishes a zero magnetic field along the longitudinal symmetry axis. Two of three pairs of trapping laser beams do not follow the symmetry axes of the quadruple magnetic field and are aligned with a large non-zero degree angles to the longitudinal axis. In a dark-line 2D MOT configuration, there are two orthogonal repumping beams. In each repumping beam, an opaque line is imaged to the longitudinal axis, and the overlap of these two line images creates a dark line volume in the longitudinal axis where there is no repumping light. The zero magnetic field along the longitudinal axis allows the cold atoms maintain a long ground-state coherence time without switching off the MOT magnetic field, which makes it possible to operate the MOT at a high repetition rate and a high duty cycle.

The present disclosure relates to a neutral atom trapping device with high optical depth for quantum optics experiments.

Since laser cooling and trapping was developed in 1980 s E. L. Raab M. Prentiss A. Cable S. Chu and D. E. Pritchard Phys. Rev. Lett. 59 2631 1987 that led to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 the magneto optical trap MOT has been widely applied and implemented to provide cold atom sources for scientific researches in the field of atomic physics and quantum optics. Many cold atom devices have been invented for possible applications in atomic sensors and some of them have been commercialized See ColdQuanta Inc D. Z. Anderson and J. G. J. Reichel US Patent 2005 0199871 D. Z. Anderson et al US Patent 2010 0200739 M. Hyodo U.S. Pat. No. 7 816 643 B2 . The most commonly used cold atom device is the three dimensional 3D MOT with a configuration of six trapping laser beams and a 3D quadrupole magnetic field where the cold atoms are trapped at the position of zero magnetic field spherically. In that configuration there is only one point of zero magnetic field and the atoms experience magnetic gradients along every direction. Therefore for experiments and applications which require long atomic coherence time such as electromagnetically induced transparency EIT atomic quantum memory and single photon generation the magnetic field must be switched off before the experimental time window A. Kuzmich W. P. Bowen A. D. Boozer A. Boca C. W. Chou L. M. Duan and H. J. Kimble Nature 423 731 2003 . . This significantly adds complicity in the controlling system and prevents the experimental data collected from a high repetition rate because it always takes time to switch off the current in a magnetic coil due to the inductance. The quantum optics and photon counting experiments based on the 3D MOT are typically time consuming.

One approach changes a 3D quadrupole magnetic field to a 2D quadrupole magnetic field with a line of zero magnetic fields. This is called a 2D MOT where the cold atoms are trapped in the zero magnetic field line along the longitudinal symmetry axis. There are two configurations in the conventional 2D MOT devices. In the first configuration there are only 4 trapping laser beams transmitted perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis T. G. Tiecke S. D. Gensemer A. Ludewig and J. T. M. Walraven Phys. Rev. A 80 013409 2009 . As a result the cooling and trapping occur only two dimensionally and there is no cooling and trapping along the longitudinal symmetry axis where the atoms are free to move. In the second configuration two more counter propagating trapping laser beams are added along the longitudinal axis to provide the additional cooling in the third dimension K. Dieckmann R. J. C. Spreeuw M. Weidemuller and J. T. M. Walraven Phys. Rev. A 58 3891 1998 . In that setup the optical accesses along the longitudinal symmetry axis are blocked or shared by the two trapping beams along that direction. The conventional 2D M

High optical depth OD is sought for much quantum optics research A. V. Gorshkov A. Andre M. Fleischhauer A. S. Sorensen and M. D. Lukin Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 123601 2007 but in the traditional MOT optical configuration high OD is commonly obtained by increasing the MOT size where more cold atoms can be obtained in the cloud. But the MOT size is usually determined by the MOT laser beam size which is limited by the total laser power. Another way to improve the OD is increasing the atomic density in the cloud using a dark spot configuration W. Ketterle K. B. Davis M. A. Joffe A. Martin and D. E. Pritchard Phys. Rev. Lett. 70 2253 1993 but the magnetic field gradient is often required to switched off for applications. Also in conventional 2D MOTs there is a limitation for optical access due to its geometry and the OD may need to be further improved.

A two dimensional 2D magneto optical trap MOT comprises an atom source a bakeable ultra high vacuum cell a two dimensional quadrupole magnetic field at least 6 trapping laser beams and at least one repumping laser beams. In the dark line 2D MOT configuration we use two orthogonal repumping laser beams with a dark line crossover at center along the longitudinal axis. At least two pairs trapping laser beams do not follow the symmetry axis of the quadrupole magnetic field they are aligned with non zero degree angles relative to the longitudinal axis of the MOT.

A two dimensional magneto optical trap 2D MOT system uses six trapping laser beams. The 2D MOT has no trapping beam in the symmetry axis so that it allows full optical access to further experiments. For conducting quantum optics experiments there is no need to switch off the magnetic field for maintaining long atomic coherence time. In the following description for the purpose of illustration Rb atoms are taken as a demonstrated example. The principles described here can be applied to other neutral atoms.

In one embodiment the 2D MOT apparatus comprises a compact bakeable ultra high vacuum cell a single hollow core wire magnetic coil and an optical alignment with six trapping laser beams. The bakeable ultra high vacuum cell comprises a glass cell with optical quality a six way all metal cross chamber an atomic dispenser source an ion pump and a turbo molecular pump. The glass cellcan take either an octagonal or rectangular shape. The magnetic coil taking a single wire design produces a 2D quadrupole magnetic field with a zero magnetic field line along the longitudinal axis.

For the trapping laser a six beam configuration is used. Two counter propagating trapping laser beams are transmitted perpendicularly to the longitudinal symmetry axis and the other four two counter propagating pairs trapping laser beams are aligned with a 45 angle to the symmetry axis. The cold atoms are trapped along the symmetry axis. Because there is no trapping beam in the symmetry axis the device provides a full optical access along the symmetry axis. As a result of the six beam configuration a three dimensional cooling effect is achieved so the cooling effect of the MOT occurs in all directions though the atoms are trapped two dimensionally in a line.

This 2D MOT is capable of trapping a stable line shaped cold atomic cloud with a high optical depth. The zero magnetic field line along the symmetry axis leads to a long ground state coherence time of the atoms without turning off the MOT magnetic field. Therefore the 2D MOT is suitable for quantum optics research experiments at a high repetition rate such as electromagnetically induced transparency atomic memory and storage single photon and bi photon generation.

The configuration differs from the conventional configuration in that two of three pairs of trapping laser beams in the disclosed 2D MOT setup do not follow the symmetry axis of the quadrupole magnetic field but instead are aligned with a large non zero degree angles. In one non limiting example an alignment of 45 is selected as an optimal alignment with the optimal alignment used as a target alignment.

The six beam alignment is considered to be an optimal configuration for a given total trapping laser power. With the six beam configuration as a base one can add more counter propagating beam pairs to achieve similar trapping results. The selection of the six beam configuration is made to obtain high optical depth and trap as many atoms as possible. It is possible to achieve a working MOT with more than 6 beams but the non six beam configurations are not optimal for a given total laser power.

In one disclosed configuration a dark line 2D MOT system is implemented. This configuration includes a an atom source b a bakeable ultra high vacuum cell c a two dimensional quadrupole magnetic field d at least 6 trapping laser beams and e two orthogonal repumping laser beams with a dark linecrossover at center along the longitudinal axis.

In this embodiment two orthogonal repumping laser beams are used. In each repumping beam an opaque line is imaged to the longitudinal axis of the 2D MOT. The overlap of these two line images creates a dark line volume in the longitudinal axis where there is no repumping light.

In one example of a dark line 2D Rb MOT with a trapping laser power of 40 mW and repumping laser power of 18 mW we can obtain an atomic OD up to 160 in an electromagnetically induced transparency EIT scheme which corresponds to an density length product of NL 2.05 10m. In a closed two state system the OD can get as large as 600 or greater. The example 2D MOT configuration allows for full optical access of the atoms in its longitudinal direction without interfering with the trapping laser beams spatially. Moreover the zero magnetic field along the longitudinal axis allows the cold atoms to maintain a long ground state coherence time without switching off the MOT magnetic field which makes it possible to operate the MOT at a high repetition rate and a high duty cycle. The 2D MOT is ideal for atomic ensemble based quantum optics applications such as EIT entangled photon pair generation optical quantum memory and quantum information processing.

An example configuration uses two orthogonal repumping laser beams. In each repumping beam an opaque line is imaged to the longitudinal axis of the 2D MOT. An opaque line is placed outside the glass cell and in the path of the repumping beams to block some part of light. A lens is used to create an image of the wire to the middle of the atoms in the 2D MOT resulting in two images of the opaque line. Overlap of the two wire images from both repumping beams creates a dark line volume where the repumping light is absent. In one non limiting example the opaque line is established by a copper wire with a diameter of 0.6 mm and the two images are images of the wire.

The six trapping laser beams still cover the entire MOT. Compared to the previous version without the repumping dark line this dark line 2D MOT is capable of producing a line shaped cold atom trap with a much higher optical depth but with lower laser powers.

The 2D MOT device allows production of laser cooled atomic ensemble with a high optical depth and a low ground state dephasing rate or a long coherence time . The apparatus comprises a bakeable ultra high vacuum cell a single hollow core wire magnetic coil and an optical alignment with six trapping laser beams. The features of the apparatus include the 2D quadrupole magnetic field generated from the magnetic coil and the laser beam alignment that allows maximum optical access to the cold atoms along the symmetry axis. The system can be run at a high repetition rate because the long atomic ground state coherence time can be achieved without the need of turning off the magnetic field.

An alternative choice of the glass cell can be a rectangle shape. are schematic drawings of the rectangle glass cell. shows the schematic drawing of a second embodiment of the glass vacuum cell with a rectangle shape and its magnetic and optical alignments. The detailed drawing of the glass cell is displayed in comprising a rectangle shaped glass chamber a glass to metal transition tube and a metal flange . Glass chamber further includes four rectangle shaped windows and a pair of square side windows and .

The apparatus with the rectangle shape cell can also be used to create multiple MOTs along the longitudinal axis. As an example is a schematicdrawing showing two MOTs are created in a single rectangle cell showing a two MOTconfiguration with the rectangle shape cell. With the same 2D quadrupole magnetic field and two sets of trapping lasers two separated MOTs and are formed as shown in the figure. The principle can be extended to more than two MOTs.

The physics mechanism of 45 degree beam alignment is shown in as a comparison with the conventional 3D MOT alignment in and the conventional 2D MOT alignment in . As shown in in the conventional 3D MOT the magnetic field is produced from a pair of anti Helmholtz coils and with opposite electric currents. The arrows along the magnetic lines indicate the directions of the magnetic field. To illustrate clearly how the laser beams are aligned the 3D plots are separated onto y z and x z planes where z is the longitudinal symmetry axis. Using the configuration as shown in the magnetic field on the z axis points toward z direction while on the z axis toward z direction. The magnetic field on the x or y axis points toward x y direction while on the x or y axis points toward x y direction. Six laser beams and and their circular polarizations are aligned related to the magnetic field directions. Here the circular polarizations of right handedness RHC and left handedness LHC are taken as defined from the point of view of the receiver.

In the 3D MOT configuration the circular polarizations of the six beams are show in in the z axis the two laser beams and are both in RHC while all other four beams are in LHC. The system has a rotational symmetry along z axis and there is no preference in choosing x and y axes in the x y plane. In the conventional 2D MOT configuration as shown in the magnetic field can be molded as that produced from four straight wires and which result in a zero magnetic field along z axis. In the four beam 2D MOT configuration there is no laser beam along z axis. The laser beams and polarizations along y and x directions are illustrated in and they are all perpendicular to the z axis. This configuration has no cooling along z axis and it is commonly used to generate moving atomic beams. To add additional cooling along z direction people add a pair of counter propagating beams and to the z axis. There is no polarization preference for these two beams because the magnetic field along z axis is zero.

The 2D MOT six laser beam alignment configured according to the present disclosure is shown in . The disclosed 2D MOT is different from the conventional alignments in that the four laser beams in the y z plane are not aligned along the magnetic field directions that is y and z axes. The four laser beams and are aligned with 45 degree angles with respect to the z axis. In other words they are also aligned with 45 degree angles to the magnetic field lines . The polarizations of these four beams are all LHC. Along the x axis the two laser beams take the same configuration as the conventional design with RHC polarizations. This unique beam configuration not only allows a stable MOT with high optical depth but also opens full optical access along z axis for experiment. The above description is presented for purpose of illustration. As mentioned the laser beam polarizations are closely related to the magnetic field directions. In the above configurations in B and C if all the magnetic field directions change to their opposite which could be done by switching the directions of the electric current one should change the polarizations from RHC to LHC and from LHC to RHC.

The dark line 2D MOT device produces a laser cooled atomic ensemble with a high optical depth and a low ground state dephasing rate or a long coherence time . The apparatus comprises a bakeable ultra high vacuum cell a 2D quadrupole magnetic field at least six trapping laser beams and two orthogonal repumping beams with a dark line crossover. In the following description for the purpose of illustration Rb atoms are taken as a demonstrated example. The principles described here can be applied to other neutral atoms.

The magneto optical configuration comprises a 2D quadrupole magnetic field produced from a magnetic coil with a current represented by arrows . Also shown are six trapping beams and and two repumping beams and with an overlapping dark line depicted in . One pair of counter propagating trapping laser beams and are aligned along the x axis. Different form the conventional 2D and 3D MOT optical alignments the other four trapping beams are not aligned along the symmetry axes of the magnetic field. For example in the conventional 2D MOT configuration these four trapping beams are aligned along y and z axes. In contrast in the present 2D MOT setup these four trapping beams and are aligned at non zero degree the optimal value is 45 angles to the y and z axes as shown in . Because the atoms are trapped along the longitudinal x axis this configuration opens full optical access along the atom line which is the direction for high optical depth. With the illustrated magnetic coil current direction and magnetic field the polarizations and of the six trapping beams are also shown in B and C. To efficiently making use of the trapping laser power the two 45 beams are retro reflected by the mirrors and through quarter wave plates and as shown in . Two repumping laser beams are used. The repumping beam overlaps with the trapping beam along the x axis. The repumping beam is aligned along the y axis. In each repumping beam there is an opaque wire line. The images of these opaque wires through a lens imaging system in each beam overlaps at the center of the 2D MOT and creates a dark line of the repumping beams along the z axis. In the dark line regime the atoms are pumped into the dark state without interacting with the trapping laser and thus avoid the radiation trapping loss and heating. In the demonstrated Rb 2D MOT example the trapping laser is red detuned by 20 MHz from the transition 5S F 3 5P F 4 and the repumping laser is on resonance with the transition 5S F 2 5P F 2. Both trapping and repumping beams have the same beam diameter of 2 cm. The total laser powers are 40 mW and 18 mW for the trapping laser and repumping laser respectively.

Water cooled magnetic coil shown in is made of a single hollow core copper wire with a square cross section which is similar to that shown in . depict the magnetic fields established by magnetic coil . The small inductance 100 H of this coil also allows us to switch on and off the magnetic field in a short time. Controlling the magnetic field is necessary for obtaining the atomic ground state coherence time of more than 10 s. A dephasing rate of 2 0.03 MHz between the two ground levels is obtained which corresponds to a coherence time of 5.3 s without switching off the 2D MOT quadrupole magnetic field during the measurement. If such several s coherence time is long enough for applications the quadrupole magnetic field can be caused to remain on continuously and the magnetic coil can be simplified. In this case the magnetic coil set can be assembled from four independent coils and as shown in . There are multiple turns in each coil so that they can be driven by a low current power supply without additional water cooling. Such a steady MOT magnetic field can also be generated by 4 permanent magnet bars and aligned in the configuration shown in . Using permanent magnet bars dramatically simplify the system and reduce the power consumption because it can be self standing without using any electrical power supply. While water cooling is described it is anticipated that alternate liquid coolants may be used.

Therefore the magnetic field can remain on continuously during an experiment while maintaining a ground state coherence time of up to 5 s. The magnetic field can be turned off for obtaining a ground state coherence time of more than 5 s.

The dark line 2D MOT can perform the functions of 2D MOT apparatus of . The fluoroscopic images obtained from cold atoms of Rb depicted in are also representative of the output of the dark line 2D MOT apparatus. EIT measurements are taken to characterize the 2D MOT properties. EIT as quantum interference between atomic transitions has been widely used to manipulate optical response of an atomic medium and found its wide applications in slow light nonlinear wave mixing optical switching entangled photon pair generation optical quantum memory and quantum information processing. For illustration purpose the following measurements are performed with a Rb 2D MOT.

As depicted in weak probe laser beam propagates along the 2D MOT longitudinal z axis and is focused to the center of the MOT with a 1 ebeam diameter of 245 m at the waist. The probe absorption spectrum is measured with a photomultiplier tube by scanning its frequency across the transition 1 3. To ensure that linear propagation effect is studied the intensity of the probe laser is kept sufficiently low that the atomic population remains primarily in the state 1. A collimated coupling laser beam on resonance at the transition 2 3 and with a 1 ebeam diameter of 1.6 mm passes through the cold atoms with an angle of 3 respect to the probe laser beam. Both the probe and coupling laser beams have the same circular polarizations to optimize the EIT effect. The measurement is taken periodically. At each period of T 5 ms the MOT trapping time is set at t 4.2 ms and the measurement duty including state preparation and EIT measurement time is set at t 0.8 ms. At the end of each MOT trapping time after the repumping laser is switched off the trapping laser remains on for additional t 0.3 ms to optically pump all the atoms into the ground state 1 which is preferable for the EIT scheme. To reduce this time of 0.3 ms in the duty window one can also use an additional on resonance laser to pump the atoms more efficiently in a much shorter time 

Another important number for characterizing the system performance is the duty cycle defined as the ratio of duty window time length to the period

Because the MOT time and EIT application duty window must be separated at different time slots the duty cycle reflects the use efficiency of the cold atoms. During the duty window some atoms are lost from the trap because of the background collision free expansion and falling under the gravity. As a result the optical depth drops the duty cycle is increased. The above measurements at OD 140 are taken with a duty cycle 16 . The duty cycle can be varied by changing either the MOT trapping time tor the duty time t.

The above mentioned OD is in the EIT three level scheme where 1 3 is an open transition with an absorption cross section

The 6 trapping beam configuration 3 pairs of trapping beams shown in is an optimal configuration geometry given by way of non limiting example. The minimum number of trapping beams for obtaining a stable MOT described is 6 trapping beams or 3 pairs . In general there can be more than 3 pairs of trapping laser beams.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated to explain the nature of the subject matter may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. The principles described here can be applied to cool and trap other neutral atoms which require trapping and repumping lasers at different wavelengths.
