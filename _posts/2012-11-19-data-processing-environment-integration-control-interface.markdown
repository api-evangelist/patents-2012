This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 400 505 filed Feb. 20 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 446 885 filed Feb. 25 2011 both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The disclosure relates generally to data processing systems and methods and more specifically to systems and methods for using data processing resources provided as a service known as cloud computing and to systems and methods for processing a workload using such data processing resources and for correlating monitored data from such data processing resources to identify the occurrence of an event of interest.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. For example cloud computing allows a consumer to obtain data processing resources such as networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services as a service on a temporary basis when needed. Several vendors are currently offering various cloud services. For example such services include infrastructure as a service platform as a service storage as a service software as a service and business process as a service cloud services. These services use vendor specific service requests access and consumption models.

A consumer of cloud computing services may have its own data processing system resources. For example the consumer may be a business or other entity. The consumer may have invested in its own data processing system resources. These resources may include a computer network. The consumer s computer network provides a limited amount of processing capability and data storage resources. The consumer s computer network also provides specific data processing applications. The consumer s computer network may be located on premise and may be operated as a private cloud.

At certain times the consumer may require data processing resources beyond those available in its computer network. For example at certain times the demand for data processing resources may outstrip the capability of the consumer s computer network. At these times the response time of the consumer s computer network for some applications may increase to unacceptable levels. At other times the consumer may require data processing applications that are not available on the consumer s own computer network. For example the consumer may require at times the use of data processing applications that are not part of the consumer s core competency.

At those times when the consumer requires data processing resources beyond its own the consumer may purchase such resources as a service on a temporary basis from a provider of cloud computing services. For example the consumer may obtain additional processing or storage resources or specific application functionality as a service on a temporary basis from the cloud computing provider s data processing resources. Different types of service offerings may provide parts of the solution used in processing the consumer s workload. The provider s available data processing resources is known as a public cloud.

The consumer typically continues to operate its own computer network while some data processing resources are being obtained from a public cloud. Thus data processing resources from the public cloud typically are obtained in order to supplement the data processing resources of the consumer s own private cloud at certain times of need. The simultaneous and coordinated operation of data processing resources from multiple clouds may be referred to as hybrid cloud computing. For example operation of the consumer s private cloud along with resources obtained from one or more public clouds is a specific example of hybrid cloud computing.

According to one illustrative embodiment a method for controlling an integration of data processing resources is provided. A first graphical element corresponding to a first endpoint node is displayed by a processor unit wherein the first endpoint node corresponds to first data processing resources in a data processing environment. A second graphical element corresponding to a second endpoint node is displayed by the processor unit wherein the second endpoint node corresponds to second data processing resources in the data processing environment wherein the second data processing resources comprise data processing resources provided as a service by a provider of data processing resources. A third graphical element corresponding to an integration node is displayed by the processor unit. An arrangement of the first graphical element the second graphical element and the third graphical element is displayed by the processor unit wherein the arrangement depicts integration of the first data processing resources and the second data processing resources by the integration node.

According to another illustrative embodiment an apparatus comprising a processor unit is provided. The processor unit is configured to display a first graphical element corresponding to a first endpoint node wherein the first endpoint node corresponds to first data processing resources in a data processing environment display a second graphical element corresponding to a second endpoint node wherein the second endpoint node corresponds to second data processing resources in the data processing environment wherein the second data processing resources comprise data processing resources provided as a service by a provider of data processing resources display a third graphical element corresponding to an integration node and display an arrangement of the first graphical element the second graphical element and the third graphical element wherein the arrangement depicts integration of the first data processing resources and the second data processing resources by the integration node.

According to another illustrative embodiment a computer program product for controlling an integration of data processing resources is provided. The computer program product comprises first program instructions second program instructions third program instructions and fourth program instructions stored on a computer readable storage medium. The first program instructions are to display a first graphical element corresponding to a first endpoint node wherein the first endpoint node corresponds to first data processing resources in a data processing environment. The second program instructions are to display a second graphical element corresponding to a second endpoint node wherein the second endpoint node corresponds to second data processing resources in the data processing environment wherein the second data processing resources comprise data processing resources provided as a service by a provider of data processing resources. The third program instructions are to display a third graphical element corresponding to an integration node. The fourth program instructions are to display an arrangement of the first graphical element the second graphical element and the third graphical element wherein the arrangement depicts integration of the first data processing resources and the second data processing resources by the integration node.

Further objects features and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description and taking into consideration the attached drawing figures.

It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather the illustrative embodiments are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.

For convenience the detailed description includes the following definitions which have been derived from the Draft NIST Working Definition of Cloud Computing by Peter Mell and Tim Grance dated Oct. 7 2009.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or data center .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based e mail . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or consumer acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds and service interoperability.

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

A number as used herein with reference to an item means one or more items. Further processor unit may be implemented using a number of heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example processor unit may be a symmetric multi processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.

Bus represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus an accelerated graphics port and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example and not limitation such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture ISA bus Micro Channel Architecture MCA bus Enhanced ISA EISA bus Video Electronics Standards Association VESA local bus and Peripheral Component Interconnects PCI bus.

Referring now to an illustration of a cloud computing environment is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. In this illustrative example cloud computing environment comprises one or more cloud computing nodes with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers may communicate. For example cloud computing node in is one example of cloud computing nodes . Local computing devices which may communicate with cloud computing nodes may include for example personal digital assistant PDA or cellular telephone A desktop computer B laptop computer C and or automobile computer system N. Cloud computing nodes may communicate with one another. They may be grouped not shown physically or virtually in one or more networks such as private community public or hybrid clouds as described hereinabove or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment to offer infrastructure platforms and or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices A B C and N shown in are intended to be illustrative only and that cloud computing nodes and cloud computing environment can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and or network addressable connection e.g. using a web browser . Program code located on one of cloud computing nodes may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium in one of cloud computing nodes and downloaded to a computing device within computing devices A B C and N over a network for use in these computing devices. For example a server computer in cloud computing nodes may store program code on a computer readable storage medium on the server computer.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account a number of different considerations. For example the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that many enterprises have an existing investment in information technology resources. These enterprises want to use their existing infrastructure software and management resources. At times such enterprises also may want to augment their own data processing resources selectively with cloud based services. Thus for economic and functional reasons there may be a need to use on premise enterprise infrastructure platform applications or data and off premise cloud service infrastructure platform applications or data in an integrated manner.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that in cases of cloud computing server network data and applications used in processing the enterprise workload may reside within an enterprise data center may be with partners of the enterprise or may reside over the Internet in a public cloud. Thus processing a workload using a combination of on premise enterprise resources and public cloud resources involves using some of the on premise infrastructure platform applications or data as well as some off premise cloud based services and data. Cloud computing solutions of this type may create integration interoperability management and security challenges.

For example the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that cloud computing consumers desire to maintain a seamless interface across on premise and off premise cloud boundaries. However the governing policies for cloud operation and security related procedures always need to be in place. These competing requirements create the need for an integrated infrastructure and management solution that can span across the consumer data center and into one or more public cloud environments.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that easy access to public cloud services allows such services to be consumed within an enterprise in a non centralized and unmanaged manner. De centralizing and moving data processing resources to off site vendors increases the complexity and time required to support them. Typically this complexity is only evident when the cloud resources being consumed are reported to the enterprise information technology department. Security and system governance lapses may result from this lack of management. Regulatory and business compliance may require policy based data sharing across a hybrid cloud. However current unmanaged methods for accessing cloud service resources cannot guarantee such compliance. The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account the desirability of controlling cloud vendor selection based on business conditions and established policies.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that policy based workload management across a hybrid cloud and automated support of cloud computing services will reduce information technology costs. Such hybrid cloud management and support will improve security and compliance and thereby will increase enterprise adoption of cloud technologies.

Various providers of cloud services use vendor specific service request access and consumption models. The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account the desirability of a vender neutral and service specific interface to all clouds that provide a desired cloud service.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that integrated monitoring of data processing resources and workload processing across a hybrid cloud is needed to establish automated policy based workload management. However such integrated monitoring cannot be achieved using existing solutions. Existing solutions for monitoring data processing resources and workload processing are not adapted for the dynamic nature of hybrid cloud computing environments. In particular such solutions are not adapted for hybrid cloud environments formed of separate dynamic networks of data processing resources that often must be separated from each other by firewalls to provide appropriate levels of security.

Therefore the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account the need for an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution that can span across a hybrid cloud computing environment. In particular the different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account the need for an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution that can span across a customer data center into one or more public cloud environments. The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that consumers of data processing resources desire to view the state of a workload running on a hybrid cloud using a single integrated view. An integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution in accordance with an illustrative embodiment makes possible such an integrated view.

The different illustrative embodiments also recognize and take into account that such an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution should be implemented and maintained as efficiently as possible. For example any required changes to monitoring agents or to other parts of the monitoring infrastructure should be minimized and confined to as few components as possible. Currently available solutions for monitoring data processing resources and workload processing do not provide such efficiency. Currently available solutions for monitoring data processing resources and workload processing are too cumbersome to set up and use particularly in a hybrid cloud computing environment.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a hybrid cloud integrator provides for integration of on premise infrastructure platform applications and data with public cloud based infrastructure platform services and data. A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to extend on premise data center capabilities by augmenting such capabilities with data processing capabilities provided in a public cloud. For example such cloud based capabilities may include infrastructure as a service or storage as a service capabilities. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the desired solution for processing a workload may be implemented in a hybrid cloud environment that integrates multiple private cloud and public cloud based services.

A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to extend the reach of a consumer s on premise data processing monitoring and management functionality to monitor and manage the data processing resource capabilities extended in a public cloud. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a hybrid cloud computing environment including both private cloud and public cloud based services may be monitored and managed in a more effective manner as a single logical cloud of resources. Hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment allows policy based integration of infrastructure services and data across the hybrid cloud. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment monitoring and management of the integrated infrastructure and services can be performed in a centralized manner. In this way workload specific actions can be taken consistently and in a vendor neutral manner even if the components of the workload are processed using multiple cloud based services.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a hybrid cloud integrator provides an integration platform for integrating workload monitoring and management across a hybrid cloud. The hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may comprise a hybrid cloud integrator framework. Hybrid cloud integration components may be plugged in to the framework as needed in a systematic manner.

For example in accordance with an illustrative embodiment integration components that may be plugged in to the hybrid cloud integrator framework may include a cloud service broker plug in a cloud monitoring plug in and a cloud security services plug in. Together the plug ins may be used to provision and configure an on premise or consumer side monitoring gateway and an off premise or provider cloud side monitoring gateway. These gateways are employed to provide for integrated workload monitoring across a hybrid cloud.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a consumer of data processing resources may use the integration components provided in the hybrid cloud integrator to identify and define hybrid cloud monitoring participants across the hybrid cloud. Such participants may include both an on premise monitoring infrastructure and one or more off premise cloud based services that are to be monitored using the on premise monitoring infrastructure. The consumer of data processing resources may specify parameters needed to enable integration for hybrid cloud monitoring. For example such parameters may include port identifications Internet Protocol or other addresses encryption methods used and the like. Coordination of actions among the integration component plug ins is automated so that implementation of the hybrid cloud monitoring setup may be completed automatically. Thus illustrative embodiments provide for the efficient set up of an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution for hybrid cloud monitoring.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment data processing service instances in a cloud may be monitored using monitoring agents. The monitoring agents may provide monitored data to an on premise monitoring infrastructure via the hybrid cloud integration structure established using the hybrid cloud integrator. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment as additional data processing service instances are established in the cloud or as data processing service instances are terminated monitoring of already established or remaining instances may continue without requiring changes in the monitoring agents for those instances or in the rest of the monitoring infrastructure. Thus illustrative embodiments provide for the efficient maintenance and operation of an integrated infrastructure and monitoring solution for hybrid cloud monitoring.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that current cloud based services accessible over the internet are provided by multiple vendors. Multiple vendors may offer directly competing services. For example both IBM SBDTC and Amazon EC2 offer infrastructure as a service cloud services. Different protocols and application programming interfaces are required for interfacing with these competing services. Currently consumers of these services have to develop and maintain vendor specific code to access the same service from different vendors. Consumers of cloud computing services would prefer to maintain a single vendor neutral and service specific interface to all clouds that provide a desired service. Consumers also desire to control vendor selection based on business considerations.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a cloud service broker a cloud security service and a cloud monitoring service may be provided as plug in components for a hybrid cloud integrator. These three components may operate together automatically to set up and provide monitoring of data processing resources across a hybrid cloud.

The different illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that integrating local consumer data processing resources with remote data processing resources provided as a service to form a hybrid cloud data processing environment may be a demanding task that includes many details and may require a relatively high level of skill. Integration of data processing resources across a hybrid cloud may require configuring and activating many components and may involve various different areas of expertise. For example without limitation the integration of data processing resources across a hybrid cloud may involve areas of expertise including systems storage networks applications other areas of expertise or various combinations of areas of expertise. The many details and level of expertise required may make establishing integrated connectivity across a hybrid cloud an almost impossible task for the average system administrator.

Illustrative embodiments provide a simplified conceptual model for user control of data processing resource integration in a hybrid cloud. A user interface built on this conceptual model may allow a system administrator or other user to more effectively visualize and control data processing resource integration across a hybrid cloud data processing environment.

Referring now to a block diagram of a data processing environment employing hybrid cloud integration is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Data processing environment includes consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . In some embodiments provider data processing resources may be referred to as first data processing resources and consumer data processing resources may be referred to as second data processing resources or vice versa.

Consumer data processing resources may include data processing resources that are owned or controlled exclusively by consumer of data processing resources . For example consumer of data processing resources may be a business entity or other organization or enterprise that uses consumer data processing resources to process consumer processed consumer workload .

Consumer data processing resources may include any combination of data processing systems and devices for processing consumer processed consumer workload . For example consumer data processing resources may include any combination of data processing infrastructure networks processors data storage databases and applications.

Consumer data processing resources may include or may be referred to as private cloud . Consumer data processing resources may include data processing resources that are located on premise or may be referred to as being on premise . On premise may mean that all of consumer data processing resources are co located in a single location that is owned or controlled by consumer of data processing resources that also owns or controls consumer data processing resources . Alternatively on premise may mean that consumer data processing resources are under the control of consumer of data processing resources for exclusive use by consumer of data processing resources even though some or all of consumer data processing resources are physically located in a number of remote locations.

Provider data processing resources are data processing resources that are available to be shared by a number of consumers of data processing resources including consumer of data processing resources . Provider data processing resources may include any combination of data processing systems or devices. For example provider data processing resources may include any combination of data processing infrastructure networks processors data storage or applications.

Provider data processing resources may be provided as services . For example provider data processing resources may be provided as services by public cloud . Public cloud makes provider data processing resources available to consumer of data processing resources as services . For example services may include one or more of infrastructure as a service platform as a service software as a service or other data processing related services.

At certain times consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload . Provider processed consumer workload typically is a portion of all of consumer workload that consumer of data processing resources needs to be processed. In some cases provider processed consumer workload may be all of consumer workload that consumer of data processing resources needs to be processed. For example consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when consumer data processing resources are overloaded with processing consumer processed consumer workload . At other times consumer of data processing resources may employ provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when processing of provider processed consumer workload is not one of the core competencies of consumer of data processing resources . As another example consumer of data processing resources may use provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload when particular applications required to process provider processed consumer workload are not available among consumer data processing resources . In any case processing of provider processed consumer workload using provider data processing resources may require that a number of applications or data or both applications and data be provided to provider data processing resources in order to process provider processed consumer workload .

Thus at times all of consumer workload being processed by or for consumer of data processing resources may be processed in part as consumer processed consumer workload on consumer data processing resources such as private cloud and in part as provider processed consumer workload on provider data processing resources such as public cloud . In this case the integration of private cloud and public cloud to process consumer workload for consumer of data processing resources forms hybrid cloud .

Operation of hybrid cloud requires communication between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . However security concerns may require the prevention of unauthorized access to consumer data processing resources from provider data processing resources or from any other unauthorized sources. Therefore firewall may be provided between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Firewall is designed to block unauthorized access to consumer data processing resources by provider data processing resources or by any other unauthorized sources while permitting authorized communications between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Firewall may be implemented in either hardware or software or using a combination of both hardware and software. For example without limitation firewall may be implemented in consumer data processing resources .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator provides integration across consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources to implement integrated data processing resources forming hybrid cloud . For example without limitation hybrid cloud integrator may be implemented by consumer of data processing resources on consumer data processing resources .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator includes framework integration platform and a number of plug ins . For example framework may be implemented in software as a software framework. Framework may be implemented on integration platform . Integration platform provides the underlying hardware and software required to implement hybrid cloud integrator . For example integration platform may include the hardware operating system and runtime environment in which hybrid cloud integrator is implemented.

Framework provides plug in interface . Plug in interface allows a number of plug ins to be installed in hybrid cloud integrator . Plug ins are software components that are configured to provide functionality for integrated use of consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Plug ins may include for example a number of service deployment and integration components a number of data integration components and a number of management integration components .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment service deployment and integration components may be used by consumer of data processing resources to deploy services in provider data processing resources that are needed to process or monitor provider processed consumer workload . Service deployment and integration components also may be used to integrate services deployed in provider data processing resources with consumer data processing resources to provide integrated data processing resources to process consumer workload . For example service deployment and integration components may include cloud service broker plug in . As will be described in more detail below cloud service broker plug in may be used for provisioning provider data processing resources in public cloud for use by consumer of data processing resources .

Data integration components may be used by consumer of data processing resources to migrate replicate transform and integrate data used in processing consumer workload between consumer data processing resources and provider data processing resources . Service deployment and integration components and data integration components may be used to enforce workload and data specific deployment and integration policies specified by consumer of data processing resources .

Management integration components may include any components that may be used by consumer of data processing resources to monitor and manage the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources . Management integration components may include plug in components that may be used by consumer of data processing resources to monitor the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources in order to manage such processing. For example management integration components may include cloud monitoring plug in and cloud security service plug in . As will be described in more detail below cloud monitoring plug in may be used for managing monitoring of processing of provider processed consumer workload on provider data processing resources . Cloud security service plug in may be used for managing security for the monitoring of the processing of provider processed consumer workload on provider data processing resources . Management integration components may also or alternatively include metering components or other management related components.

Operating characteristics of plug ins are defined by configuration data . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment framework may provide service connectivity management function . Service connectivity management function allows current configuration data from plug ins and other information about plug ins to be made available to a user on user interface .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator provides flexible and reliable automated integration of data processing resources across hybrid cloud to process a workload. For example hybrid cloud integrator may be used by workload manager to access provider data processing resources automatically when needed to supplement consumer data processing resources . Hybrid cloud integrator also may be used by workload manager to monitor the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources .

Workload manager may provide automated workload management . Automated workload management includes automatically managing workload processing on available data processing resources. An example of a system that provides this type of automated workload management is the IBM Tivoli Service Automation Manager TSAM available from International Business Machines Corporation. Illustrative embodiments may be used however in combination with any currently available workload manager providing automated workload management functions or with any workload manager that may become available in the future. Illustrative embodiment also may be used in combination with workload managers in which automated workload management functions are implemented in combination with a human operator.

Workload manager may provide automated workload management based on policies . Policies may define limitations under which workload manager may use available data processing resources. For example policies may define when or under what conditions workload manager may use provider data processing resources to process consumer workload . Policies also may specify which provider data processing resources may be used to process consumer workload . Policies also may specify consumer data that may be replicated and accessed by provider data processing resources and the portion of consumer workload that may be processed by provider data processing resources . Policies may specify security and privacy constraints that must be applied for processing consumer workload by provider data processing resources .

Policies may be developed using business rules management engine . Business rules management engine may take into consideration a variety of business related and other factors to determine policies . For example factors used by business rules management engine to determine policies may include financial security compliance customer relations factors or other suitable factors.

Workload manager may provide automatic policy based provisioning based on policies . For example policy based provisioning may call for the provisioning of provider data processing resources to process provider processed consumer workload . In this case workload manager may use hybrid cloud integrator to deploy provider data processing resources needed to process provider processed consumer workload . For example service deployment and integration components may be used to deploy services in public cloud that are needed to process provider processed consumer workload . Service deployment and integration components may establish communication with provider data processing resources through firewall . For example such communication may be established via application programming interface portal in public cloud . Applications data or both applications and data needed for processing provider processed consumer workload may be provided to provider data processing resources by workload manager via hybrid cloud integrator .

Hybrid cloud integrator also may be used to establish workload processing image in public cloud . Workload processing image pre defines services needed to process provider processed consumer workload . By establishing workload processing image in advance provider data processing resources needed to process provider processed consumer workload may be deployed more rapidly when workload manager determines that provider data processing resources will be used for this purpose.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator allows workload manager to access provider data processing resources as easily as consumer data processing resources . Plug ins in hybrid cloud integrator handle all of the special requirements of provider data processing resources needed to access those resources.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator also provides for monitoring the processing of provider processed consumer workload by provider data processing resources . For example as will be described in more detail below service deployment and integration components and management integration components may be used to establish and manage monitoring of the processing of provider processed consumer workload . Monitored data from provider data processing resources may be provided to monitoring infrastructure via hybrid cloud integrator . Similarly consumer processing monitoring agent may be implemented in consumer data processing resources . Consumer processing monitoring agent collects data for monitoring the processing of consumer processed consumer workload by consumer data processing resources . Monitored data from consumer data processing resources may be provided from consumer processing monitoring agent to monitoring infrastructure .

Monitoring infrastructure may be implemented in consumer data processing resources . Monitoring infrastructure may receive monitoring information for provider data processing resources via hybrid cloud integrator and monitoring information from consumer processing monitoring agent for consumer data processing resources . Monitoring infrastructure may process the received monitoring information to generate an integrated display of workload processing conditions for provider data processing resources and consumer data processing resources . This integrated display may be presented to a user such as a system administrator on monitoring station . Thus in accordance with an illustrative embodiment a display of workload processing conditions across hybrid cloud may be presented to a user in an integrated manner. Such an integrated display allows a user to monitor and manage workload processing across hybrid cloud in an integrated effective and efficient manner.

Monitoring infrastructure also may look for and detect the occurrence of events from the monitoring information provided to monitoring infrastructure . Events may be defined by the occurrence of specified conditions or patterns in the monitored data. For example monitored data exceeding a defined threshold for at least a specified time period may indicate the occurrence of one of events . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment events may be defined by the occurrence of any condition state or pattern of interest in the monitored data provided to monitoring infrastructure .

Events may be provided as input to event correlation and aggregation function . Event correlation and aggregation function may provide and may be referred to as an event correlation service. For example event correlation and aggregation function may be implemented as an event correlation service for correlating and aggregating workload characteristics using low level monitored data and events collected from monitoring of resources and services across hybrid cloud . Event correlation function may be implemented as a plug in oriented modular and programmable event correlation service as described in more detail below.

Event correlation and aggregation function may aggregate and correlate events over periods of time. Event correlation and aggregation function may determine whether the aggregated and correlated events indicate the presence of data processing conditions that should be or may be addressed to maintain or improve system performance. For example event correlation and aggregation function may determine that a series of detected events has occurred indicating that consumer data processing resources or provider data processing resources are overloaded. Similarly event correlation and aggregation function may determine that a series of detected events has occurred indicating that consumer data processing resources or provider data processing resources are being underutilized. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment any data processing condition of interest that may be defined by aggregated or correlated events may be detected by event correlation and aggregation function .

In response to a determination by event correlation and aggregation function that a data processing condition of interest exists service desk ticketing function may send event based service request to workload manager . For example service desk ticketing function may generate event based service request in response to a determination by event correlation and aggregation function that a data processing condition exists that should be or may be addressed to maintain or improve system performance. Event based service request may indicate to workload manager the particular condition that has been determined to exist. In this case workload manager may determine the appropriate action to take in response to the indicated condition. Alternatively service desk ticketing function may determine the action that needs to be taken in response to a particular condition that has been determined to exist. In this case event based service request may indicate to workload manager the action that is being requested.

In any case workload manager may determine whether or not any action may be taken in response to a particular data processing condition based on policies . If workload manager determines that action will be taken in response to a particular data processing condition workload manager may implement such action based on policies . For example workload manager may respond to event based service request by implementing appropriate policy based provisioning of data processing resources as needed to respond to a detected data processing condition.

Workload manager also may respond to event based service request by generating service fulfillment response . For example service fulfillment response may be generated by workload manager and delivered to service desk ticketing function . Service fulfillment response may indicate that event based service request has been received by workload manager . Service fulfillment response also may indicate that appropriate action has been taken or will be taken in response to event based service request . In this case service fulfillment response may or may not specify the particular action taken or to be taken by workload manager in response to event based service request . In some cases workload manager may not be able to take action to change data processing conditions in response to event based service request . For example policies may prevent workload manager from taking action in response to event based service request at a particular time. In this case service fulfillment response may indicate that action will not be taken by workload manager in response to event based service request or that the implementation of such action may be delayed. Policies responsible for such a failure to act or for such a delay may or may not be identified in service fulfillment response .

The information provided by event based service request and service fulfillment response may be formatted appropriately and displayed for a user on monitoring station . By displaying information from event based service request and service fulfillment response in this manner a user is able to monitor the detection of data processing system conditions for which an appropriate action may be taken and the response of workload manager to the detection of such conditions.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to respond to determined data processing conditions of interest in consumer data processing resources in provider data processing resources or both. Furthermore hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to access consumer data processing resources provider data processing resources or both for responding to determined conditions of interest. Thus hybrid cloud integrator makes it possible for workload manager to provide integrated data processing resource management across hybrid cloud by providing for monitoring of data processing conditions across hybrid cloud and by providing access to data processing resources across hybrid cloud when responding to such conditions.

For example hybrid cloud integrator may be used to establish monitoring of the processing of portions of consumer workload by provider data processing resources while processing of other portions of consumer workload by consumer data processing resources also is monitored at the same time. Based on such monitoring an overload condition or underutilization condition on consumer data processing resources on provider data processing resources or both may be determined. In response to such a determination workload manager may activate or deactivate selected consumer data processing resources may deploy or release selected provider data processing resources using hybrid cloud integrator in the manner described or both. Processing of portions of consumer workload then may be allocated by workload manager across the reconfigured resources of hybrid cloud to remedy the determined overload or underutilization condition. The particular action taken by workload manager in response to the determined condition may be determined by policies .

Although two public clouds public clouds and are shown in cloud service broker may be used to provide cloud service provisioning and management for a single cloud of any type or for more than two clouds of any type.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment cloud service broker provides cloud service broker interface . Cloud service broker interface provides a single vendor neutral interface for provisioning and managing cloud services and from multiple public clouds and . For example cloud service broker may be made accessible within consumer data processing resources from a published location. Applications and other users wishing to use cloud services or may access such services via cloud service broker interface provided by cloud service broker . Applications and other users requesting cloud provisioning or management services via cloud service broker interface need not be aware of cloud specific configurations and public cloud interfaces and .

Cloud service broker may provide access to multiple vendor provided cloud services such as cloud services and using a centrally managed and administered component.

Cloud service broker interfaces with individual vendor provided cloud services such as cloud services and using the appropriate vendor specific public cloud interfaces and and associated protocols. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment cloud service broker manages vendor specific requirements transparently to the clients of cloud service broker such as applications . For example addition deletion and modification in vendor provided cloud services and protocols or application programming public cloud interfaces and may be handled by cloud service broker in a manner that is transparent to applications and other users. Thus applications are shielded from library and application programming interface changes at the cloud level. Applications such as workload management applications only need be aware of cloud service broker interface to use cloud services and . Applications need not have details of public cloud interfaces and and other access details.

Cloud service broker may support provisioning and management of cloud services and provided by a number of different cloud types. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment cloud types supported by cloud service broker may be defined by cloud type plug ins to cloud service broker . Individual cloud type plug ins may be provided for each different cloud type that is supported by cloud service broker .

Cloud type plug ins may come provided with product . Cloud type plug ins that come provided with product are provided along with cloud service broker when cloud service broker is first obtained and installed in hybrid cloud integrator . Alternatively or additionally cloud type plug ins may be downloaded and implemented configured and activated in cloud service broker at a later time.

Cloud service broker may be used for provisioning and management of cloud services and on specific instances of a cloud type. For example cloud service broker may be used to provision and manage cloud services and on multiple clouds of a given type or of more than one type. Cloud service broker may maintain cloud definitions for each such cloud instance. Cloud definitions define the details of cloud instances of various cloud types supported by cloud service broker . Each such cloud instance is defined by unique attributes that are specified in cloud definitions . Cloud instances may be identified in cloud definitions by an identifying cloud name or handle and the associated cloud instance attributes. The cloud name is used as an external key that is used by the system to identify automatically which cloud to address. Cloud attributes may include for example and without limitation cloud type end point address and location data. The cloud type may be identified based on supported application programming interfaces. For example IBM Compute Cloud and Amazon EC2 Cloud are examples of cloud types. The cloud end point address may be for example a universal resource locator. The cloud location includes cloud type specific location data. These details may be saved by cloud service broker as cloud definitions . Applications or other users of cloud service broker may use the name associated with one of cloud service broker cloud definitions to direct workload to cloud services and on the corresponding cloud instance.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment cloud service broker may be used to provision cloud services and for any number of defined cloud types and instances of those cloud types. Cloud service broker also may provide an extensible set of service handlers . For example cloud service broker in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may provide a framework for handling custom service call parameters exception handling and result handling. An abstract class may be used to provide a common framework for all cloud type service implementations. A list of common services in the framework may be extended without the prerequisite of having all cloud type plug ins updated first. Cloud service broker may default to an exception for any not yet implemented cloud type plug ins. For example cloud service broker may default to UnsupportedCloudServiceException for any not yet implemented cloud type plug ins.

Examples of service handlers that may be supported by cloud service broker may include without limitation one or more of the following 

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment cloud service broker may provide an administrative control point for enforcement of policies . Policies may be defined by consumer of data processing resources or another entity to define limits or conditions for provisioning services by cloud service broker . For example policies may define or limit the cloud types or cloud instances that may be provisioned by cloud service broker or the conditions under which cloud services may be provisioned by cloud service broker .

The use of plug in components in a hybrid cloud integrator as described above facilitates integration of data processing resources across a data processing environment such as a hybrid cloud. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the plug in components may provide various integration functionalities. However individual plug in components may need to be implemented and configured appropriately depending upon what needs to be integrated for a particular integration. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the same plug in component may be configured in different ways to provide the desired functionality in different integration implementations.

A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may include a user interface that allows a user to quickly and effectively implement and configure plug in components in the hybrid cloud integrator. For example the user interface may include a graphical user interface built on a simplified conceptual model of data processing resource integration in the hybrid cloud using the hybrid cloud integrator.

Turning now to a block diagram of a conceptual model for user control of data processing resource integration is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Conceptual model may be used in combination with data processing resource integration using a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Conceptual model may comprise endpoint nodes and and integration node . Integration node connects endpoint node to endpoint node . Endpoint nodes and may be referred to as a first endpoint node and a second endpoint node respectively.

Endpoint nodes and may correspond to different data processing resources in a data processing environment. Endpoint node may be type of data processing resource. Endpoint node may be type of data processing resource. Type may be the same or different from type .

For example without limitation endpoint node may correspond to a local endpoint that may include technologies services or applications that may be hosted by first data processing resources in a hybrid cloud data processing environment. In this case endpoint node may correspond to a service management system monitoring system event correlation system usage and accounting system or some other information technology management system in on premise data processing resources a private cloud or other consumer data processing resources in the hybrid cloud.

For example without limitation endpoint node may correspond to a cloud endpoint that may include technologies services or applications that may be hosted by second data processing resources in the hybrid cloud data processing environment. In this case endpoint node may correspond to a cloud service provisioning service cloud service monitoring service image management service cloud service usage metering and accounting service workflow management service or some other cloud provided service in off premise data processing resources public cloud data processing resources or other provider data processing resources that may be provided as a service to a consumer of data processing resources.

Endpoint node may include service connector . Service connector may correspond to cloud services that may be provided as a service by endpoint node . Service connector may provide integration interfaces for the corresponding cloud service . These interfaces may be used in the integration of endpoint node with the corresponding cloud service . Endpoint node may include a number of service connectors that may correspond to various different data processing services that may be provided by endpoint node . For example a provider of infrastructure as a service type of cloud services may provide services for deployment of different types of virtual machines services for image management services for monitoring of deployed virtual machine instances or other services and various combinations of services. A corresponding service connector may be provided for each such cloud service provided by an off premise data processing entity or a public cloud provider.

Endpoint nodes and may include information that describes various properties and attributes of endpoint nodes and . In particular endpoint nodes and may include information for connecting to and using the data processing resources provided at endpoint nodes and . Some of this information may be integration specific. In this case this information may be provided by an integration administrator or other user to enable specific endpoint integrations. In other cases the information may be endpoint specific and may be orthogonal to a specific integration. In such cases to simplify the task of the integration administrator or other user the information for connecting to and using the data processing resources at endpoint nodes and may be built in endpoint nodes and making it unnecessary for the integration administrator or other users to keep track of such information and provide it to the integration system.

Integration node may include the information that may be used to establish integration specific connectivity between endpoint nodes and . By incorporating integration specific information integration node may simplify the integration task making it unnecessary for integration administrators or other users to provide detailed information about the integration and for establishing connectivity between endpoint nodes and . This integration specific information thus may reduce the complexity of integration for integration administrators and other users. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment without limitation integration node may include information identifying plug ins for a hybrid cloud integrator and configurations for the plug ins that may be used to establish connectivity for the desired integration between endpoint nodes and .

Endpoint nodes and and integration node may be used to establish and control integration of the data processing resources corresponding to endpoint nodes and . For example endpoint nodes and and integration node may include all of the information that is necessary to establish connectivity between endpoint nodes and and to control the integration of the data processing resources associated with endpoint nodes and to process a workload.

Turning now to an example of a user interface for data processing resource integration control is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. User interface may be generated from conceptual model for user control of data processing resource integration in . In this example user interface may be an example of one implementation of user interface in or user interface in . User interface is a specific example of a user interface for controlling specific integrations of data processing resources in a hybrid cloud data processing environment. Illustrative embodiments are not limited to the specific example depicted in .

User interface is a graphical user interface. User interface may be implemented on any data processing system that includes a display device for presenting graphical elements to a user and a user interface device for the user to interact with the graphical elements. For example without limitation user interface may be implemented using display and input output unit in data processing system in . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a user may interact with the graphical elements in user interface to control the integration of data processing resources in a hybrid cloud data processing environment.

In this example user interface includes graphical elements and corresponding to various endpoint nodes in the hybrid cloud data processing environment graphical elements and corresponding to service connectors associated with endpoint nodes and representing off premise data processing resources public cloud data processing resources or other provider data processing resources that may be provided as a service to a consumer of data processing resources and graphical elements and corresponding to various integration nodes. Graphical elements and may include text or other labels for identifying the name of the data processing resource or service corresponding to a particular endpoint node the type of data processing resource or service corresponding to a particular endpoint node or both. For example text associated with graphical element indicates that graphical element corresponds to a data processing resource with the name Endpoint A and of type Type A . Graphical elements and may include text or other labels for identifying the service provided by an endpoint node that is associated with a particular service connector. For example text associated with graphical element indicates that graphical element corresponds to a service connector for Cloud Service A provided by Endpoint B . Graphical elements and may include text or other labels for identifying the integration between endpoint nodes provided by specific integration nodes. For example text associated with graphical element may indicate that graphical element corresponds to an integration node for providing Integration A between endpoint nodes.

The arrangement of the graphical elements in user interface indicates the connectivity between endpoint nodes for specific integrations. For example the arrangement of graphical elements and and the lines connecting these graphical elements indicates that Integration A provides connectivity between Endpoint A and Endpoint B via the service connector for Cloud Service A provided by Endpoint B .

Graphical or text indicators or both may be used to identify the operational status of various components of the data processing environment represented in user interface . For example without limitation indicator associated with graphical element may indicate that Endpoint A is enabled or active. Indicator associated with graphical element may indicate that Integration B is disabled or inactive. Different indicators from those depicted by example herein may be used to identify various states of operation for components of a data processing environment in a graphical user interface in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

User interface thus allows a user to see at a glance the connectivity and integrations currently enabled between data processing resources in a hybrid cloud data processing environment. User interface also may be configured to provide controls for the life cycle management of the integration of data processing resources. For example without limitation user interface may be configured to provide controls for starting the integration stopping the integration restarting the integration or taking other actions or combinations of actions for controlling integration in a hybrid cloud data processing environment. For example without limitation user interface may provide access to a library of visual representations of graphical elements corresponding to various types of endpoint nodes and integrations that may be available in a particular data processing environment. A user may select from among these various graphical elements and arrange the selected graphical elements as desired to set up a desired integration. The user then may interact with the various graphical elements such as by selecting the graphical elements to enable disable start stop re start or take another appropriate action to control the integration.

The details necessary for establishing and controlling integration between various components in a data processing environment may be encapsulated in the graphical elements corresponding to those components in user interface in a manner that is hidden from the user. For example without limitation a particular integration may require the use of certain plug ins for a hybrid cloud integrator and configurations for the plug ins. These details may be associated with a graphical element in user interface that corresponds to an integration node for performing the particular integration. An integration administrator or other user may use the integration node to establish and control the particular integration between data processing resources without any knowledge of the required plug ins and plug in configurations. For example the user may establish and control the integration by selecting the graphical element corresponding to the integration node in user interface and manipulating the graphical element corresponding to the integration node with respect to graphical elements corresponding to desired endpoint nodes in user interface .

Turning now to an illustration of a flowchart of a process for establishing a hybrid cloud data processing environment using a hybrid cloud integrator is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. For example the workflow of may be implemented using hybrid cloud integrator of . As discussed above a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment provides a framework for deploying hybrid cloud services in a structured manner using defined application programming interfaces and other interfaces.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment a process for establishing hybrid cloud services may begin with performing a workload analysis operation . Operation may include analyzing the consumer s on premise workload for resource performance and data requirements. A gap analysis may be performed to determine current and future business requirements and the gap between current and future workload demands and on premise data processing capabilities. From the gap analysis workloads suitable for implementation using hybrid cloud computing are identified. The hybrid cloud services needed for processing the identified workloads with a hybrid cloud are then identified.

Each hybrid cloud service identified in operation is defined operation . For example operation may include defining business information technology and financial objectives for the service. Operation also may include defining the composition of the service and identifying guidelines for managing the service when in operation.

After a hybrid cloud service is defined the service is implemented operation . In accordance with an illustrative embodiment operation may include implementing the integration functionality required for the hybrid cloud service as a plug in providing hybrid cloud interfaces. Operation may include installing the required plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator.

After the plug in for a hybrid cloud service is installed the hybrid cloud integrator user interface is used to configure and deploy the hybrid cloud service operation . During runtime the hybrid cloud service is operated and managed operation with the process terminating thereafter. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment operation may include operating and managing the hybrid cloud service using the hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with the guidelines identified in operation .

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment operations and all may be performed using a hybrid cloud integrator as disclosed herein. As discussed above a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment provides a framework for performing these functions in a structured manner using defined application programming interfaces and user interfaces.

Turning now to an illustration of a flowchart of a process for configuring a hybrid cloud integrator plug in is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The plug in is registered using the hybrid cloud integrator plug in interface operation . Static and dynamic attributes of the plug in to be deployed are defined operation . For each attribute of the plug in configuration parameters type source and default values are defined or selected operation . On premise and off premise connections for the plug in are defined operation . Attribute type and default values are defined for each connection operation . Plug in life cycle management methods are defined operation . Plug in log locations and log configuration parameters may be defined operation . Policy control points for the plug in may be defined operation with the process terminating thereafter.

Referring now to an illustration of a flowchart of a process for hybrid cloud monitoring is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process illustrated in may be implemented for example in data processing environment and using hybrid cloud integrator in or in data processing environment and using hybrid cloud integrator in . The process illustrated in may be used to provide monitoring of data processing resources in a hybrid cloud environment. In this example the hybrid cloud integrator is assumed to be implemented on a consumer side of the hybrid cloud. For example the hybrid cloud integrator may be implemented in a physical server or in a virtual server deployed in on premise consumer data processing resources on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud.

Hybrid cloud monitoring in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may begin with setting up a hybrid cloud integrator with a cloud service broker cloud security service and cloud monitoring service plug ins operation . For example operation may include loading the appropriate plug ins into the hybrid cloud integrator framework. In other cases one or more of the appropriate plug ins already may be in place in the hybrid cloud integrator.

The hybrid cloud integrator then may be connected to the network so it can access consumer side data processing resources as well as provider side data processing resources operation . The network access may be from inside the consumer network infrastructure and the access to provider side resources may be restricted because of firewalls and proxy servers at the boundary of the consumer side network and external networks including the network where the provider side resources are located.

The hybrid cloud monitoring service in the hybrid cloud integrator then may be configured via the hybrid cloud integrator user interface operation . For example operation may include configuring the cloud monitoring service on the hybrid cloud integrator as a provider of monitoring data for cloud provided services to a monitoring infrastructure. The monitoring infrastructure may be implemented on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud. Operation may include using the hybrid cloud integrator user interface to configure the cloud monitoring service as a new consumer side provider to the monitoring infrastructure. For example this configuration step may include without limitation providing a name description and role for the cloud monitoring service acting as a provider to the monitoring infrastructure. Parameters to be provided as part of the configuration step may include without limitation identification of the host server for the monitoring infrastructure identification of a port for communicating with the monitoring infrastructure identification of an address for the consumer side monitoring gateway that will communicate with the monitoring infrastructure and identification of a protocol for communication between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the monitoring infrastructure.

Operation also may include configuring the cloud monitoring service on the hybrid cloud integrator by identifying the service or services to be monitored on the provider side of the hybrid cloud. This step may include creating a new provider side service participant to be monitored. For example this step may include without limitation identifying a name description and role of the cloud service to be monitored. Parameters to be provided at this part of the configuration may include without limitation an end point address and location for the cloud service to be monitored. For example without limitation the end point address may be provided as a universal resource locater address for the cloud service to be monitored.

A provider side monitoring gateway then is established and a provider side monitoring agent is set up configured and started operation . The provider side monitoring gateway may be provided on the provider side of a firewall that separates the provider side from the consumer side of a hybrid cloud. For example the provider side of the hybrid cloud may be provided on a public cloud. Operation may be implemented using the services of the cloud service broker and the cloud security service. In one example operation may include automated instantiation and configuration of the provider side monitoring gateway using the services of the cloud service broker. In another example operation may include setting up an existing provider side monitoring gateway for use with the provider side monitoring agent. Operation may include receiving via the hybrid cloud integrator a user selection indicating the process to be used to establish the provider side monitoring gateway. Operation may include providing configuration parameters for the provider side monitoring gateway to the hybrid cloud integrator via the hybrid cloud integrator user interface. Such configuration parameters may include without limitation identification of a monitoring gateway image to be used to establish the provider side monitoring gateway and an address for the provider side monitoring gateway. For example without limitation the address for the provider side monitoring gateway may be provided as an internet protocol address. In any case the provider side monitoring agent may monitor processing on the provider side of the hybrid cloud and provide resulting monitored data to the provider side monitoring gateway.

A consumer side monitoring gateway is configured and started on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud operation . For example operation may include implementing the consumer side monitoring gateway by a cloud monitoring service plug in to the hybrid cloud integrator. The consumer side monitoring gateway provides the source of provider side monitoring information to a monitoring infrastructure for monitoring resources on the provider side of the hybrid cloud. Operation may include configuring the consumer side monitoring gateway to communicate with the monitoring infrastructure.

A connection between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the monitoring infrastructure is then set up operation . The monitoring infrastructure may be implemented in the consumer side data processing system. Thus the monitoring infrastructure may be on the same side of the firewall as the consumer side monitoring gateway. The monitoring infrastructure may be implemented using a number of commercially available products for monitoring the operation of data processing resources. In another embodiment cloud based monitoring services may be used instead of a physical monitoring infrastructure.

A connection between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring gateway is then set up operation . The connection between the consumer side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring gateway may be established as a secure connection through the firewall that separates the consumer side from the provider side of the hybrid cloud.

Connections between monitoring agents on consumer side service instances and the monitoring infrastructure are set up operation . The consumer side monitoring agents provide monitoring information related to operation of the consumer side service instances to the monitoring infrastructure. The consumer side monitoring agents may be on the same side of the firewall as the monitoring infrastructure. Therefore the consumer side monitoring agents may be set up to push monitoring information to the monitoring infrastructure as such information is detected or generated by the consumer side monitoring agents.

Connections between monitoring agents on provider side service instances and the provider side monitoring gateway are set up operation . The provider side monitoring agents provide monitoring information related to operation of the provider side service instances to the provider side monitoring gateway. For example a monitoring agent may be installed and configured for each of several public cloud service instances to be monitored. Each public cloud side monitoring agent may be configured to monitor desired operating conditions of a public cloud service instance. Each public cloud side monitoring agent is configured to provide monitoring information to the provider side monitoring gateway. The provider side monitoring gateway is configured to receive the monitoring information from the public cloud side monitoring agents. Provisioning resources for the public cloud side monitoring agents and installing and configuring the monitoring agents may be performed remotely using appropriate service deployment component and management integration component plug ins in a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.

Monitored data received from the provider side monitoring agents by the provider side gateway is transferred from the provider side monitoring gateway to the consumer side monitoring gateway operation . Operation may include transferring data through the firewall separating the consumer side from the provider side of the hybrid cloud. Therefore for security reasons operation may be implemented by pulling data from the provider side monitoring gateway for transfer to the consumer side monitoring gateway. The provider side monitoring gateway may not be allowed to push data through the firewall to the consumer side of the hybrid cloud. Security of the consumer s data processing resources is maintained in this process since no data is pushed across the firewall from the provider side of the hybrid cloud.

The monitoring information pulled from the provider side gateway may be provided to the monitoring infrastructure via the consumer side gateway. From the point of view of the monitoring infrastructure the consumer side gateway provides monitoring information in the same manner as a consumer side monitoring agent for monitoring data processing resources on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud. With monitoring information for consumer side data processing resources provided by the consumer side monitoring agents and monitoring information for provider side data processing resources provided by the consumer side gateway a monitoring infrastructure is able to monitor simultaneously the operation of data processing resources on both sides of a hybrid cloud.

It may be determined that a new service instance to be monitored has been established on the provider side of the hybrid cloud operation . In response to determining that a new service instance has been established a provider side monitoring agent may be started on the new instance and connected to the provider side monitoring gateway operation . Operation may include provisioning for the new monitoring agent on the provider side of the hybrid cloud and installing and configuring the new monitoring agent on the provider side of the hybrid cloud using the appropriate hybrid cloud integrator plug ins. Operation also may include configuring the provider side monitoring gateway to receive monitoring information from the new provider side monitoring agent. For example operation may include using the cloud security service plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator to implement security policies that allow for communication between the new provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway. Security policies that allow for communication between the new provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway may be implemented for example by adding the new provider side monitoring agent to an appropriate security zone that also includes the provider side monitoring gateway. The new provider side monitoring agent then may monitor the operation of the new service instance and provide monitoring information to the provider side monitoring gateway for transfer to the monitoring infrastructure via the consumer side monitoring gateway as described above.

It also may be determined that a service instance that was being monitored has been closed or otherwise will not be monitored for some reason operation . In response to determining that monitoring of a service instance is to be stopped the monitoring connection to the closed service instance is disconnected operation . If the closed service instance is on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud operation may include disconnecting the connection between a monitoring agent on the consumer side service instance and the monitoring infrastructure. If the closed service instance is on the provider side of the hybrid cloud operation may include closing the connection between the provider side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring agent for the closed instance. Closing the connection between the provider side monitoring gateway and the provider side monitoring agent for the closed instance may include configuring the provider side monitoring gateway to no longer receive information from the monitoring agent for the closed instance. For example operation may include using the cloud security service plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator to implement security policies that prevent further communication between a provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway. Security policies that prevent communication between the provider side monitoring agent and the provider side monitoring gateway may be implemented for example by removing the provider side monitoring agent for the closed instance from the security zone that also includes the provider side monitoring gateway. Operation also may include closing the monitoring agent that is no longer needed. Closing the monitoring agent that is no longer needed allows data processing resources that were being used for the closed monitoring agent to be released.

After closing a service instance on the provider side of a hybrid cloud it may be determined that there are no more service instances running on the provider side or otherwise that are to be monitored operation . In response to determining that there are no longer any provider side service instances to be monitored the provider side monitoring gateway may be closed operation with the process terminating thereafter. Closing the provider side monitoring gateway when there are no longer any provider services to be monitored allows the provider services that were being used for the provider side gateway to be released.

Returning now to operation in response to determining that a new service instance has not been established the process proceeds to operation to determine that a service instance that was being monitored has been closed or otherwise will not be monitored for some reason. In response to determining that monitoring of a service instance is not to be stopped the process iterates back to operation and monitored data is transferred from the provider side monitoring gateway to the consumer side monitoring gateway.

Returning now to operation in response to determining that there are provider side service instances to be monitored the process iterates back to operation and monitored data is transferred from the provider side monitoring gateway to the consumer side monitoring gateway.

In some cases it may not be desirable to close the provider side monitoring gateway and release the corresponding provider data processing resources immediately when it is determined that there are no remaining provider side service instances to be monitored. For example in some cases it may be expected that monitoring of provider side services will be restarted after only a short intermission. In these cases it may be preferred to keep the provider side gateway in place but inactive even when there are no provider side service instances to be monitored. This allows the provider side monitoring gateway to be restarted quickly when new provider side service instances to be monitored are started. If the provider side monitoring gateway was closed and the corresponding provider side resources released resources would need to be re provisioned for the provider side monitoring gateway on the provider side of the hybrid cloud and the provider side monitoring gateway reinstalled and configured when new provider side service instances to be monitored are started. This process of provisioning installing and configuring a new provider side monitoring gateway would take much longer than restarting a temporarily deactivated gateway.

Turning now to illustrations of a flowchart of a process for workload overflow management are depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. For example without limitation the process of may be implemented in data processing environment using hybrid cloud integrator in . The process illustrated in is an example of workload overflow management in accordance with an illustrative embodiment in which a consumer workload may be processed in part on a consumer side of a hybrid cloud and in part on a provider side of the hybrid cloud.

Managing workload overflow in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may begin with setting up a hybrid cloud integrator with a cloud service broker and monitoring plug ins operation . The cloud service broker plug in may be configured and set up for integrating provisioning services on a consumer data processing system with provisioning services on the provider side of a hybrid cloud operation . The monitoring plug in may be set up and configured to establish hybrid cloud monitoring across data processing services on the provider side and on a consumer side of the hybrid cloud operation . Step may be implemented for example using the method illustrated in .

An event correlation service may be set up and configured operation . The event correlation service aggregates and correlates monitored data from the consumer data processing resources and services and the provider data processing resources and services that are processing the consumer workload. The event correlation service may be set up and configured for aggregating and correlating events that are specific to the workloads being processed. For example operation may include instantiating one or more instances of a number of event correlation software plug ins in the event correlation service. Instantiation of the various event correlation software instances may be accomplished via an application programming interface provided by an event correlation service software framework.

One or more workload overflow thresholds may be defined operation . The workload overflow thresholds may be defined based on a number of policies for operating a hybrid cloud to process the consumer workload. The workload overflow thresholds may be defined by workload specific parameters for a number of the event correlation software instances instantiated in operation . For example operation may include defining workload specific parameters for the number of event correlation software instances via the application programming interface provided by the event correlation service software framework.

A workload manager then may be set up and configured and processing of the workload may be started operation . The workload manager may initialize workload processing by provisioning and configuring sufficient resources and services on the consumer side of a hybrid cloud to meet the consumer s workload demand. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the workload manager also may use the services and resources on the provider side of the hybrid cloud for workload processing. The distribution of the consumer s workload between the consumer side and the provider side of a hybrid cloud may be defined by a number of policies. The workload manager keeps track of the various portions of the consumer workload that are being processed on the consumer s data processing resources and on provider data processing resources. Operation may include making the workload manager aware that the event correlation service is correlating and aggregating monitored events from across the hybrid cloud as the workload is being processed.

Monitoring of the workload and correlation of detected events is started operation . As a workload is processed on the consumer s data processing resources and perhaps also on provider data processing resources the event correlation service may continuously aggregate and correlate detected events across multiple monitored resources. For example such event correlation and aggregation may be provided by the number of event correlation software instances in the event correlation service.

Based on event aggregation and correlation by the event correlation service it may be determined that a workload overflow threshold has been exceeded operation . For example operation may be performed by an event correlation software instance in the event correlation service using a workload overload threshold defined by the workload specific parameters for the event correlation software instance. In response to a determination that the workload overflow threshold has been exceeded a service request may be sent to the workload manager operation . The service request may provide information on the overflow situation including an indication of the severity or urgency of the situation or an expected trend. This information may be provided by the event correlation service based on an evaluation of detected events. For example the service request may be generated by the event correlation software instance detecting the overflow condition. The workload manager may receive the service request and send an acknowledgment operation . For example upon receiving the service request the workload manager may send a response to the event correlation service to indicate that the service request has been received.

The workload manager then may process the service request apply policies and determine the appropriate action to take in response to the overflow condition operation . Information technology administrators business decision makers and others responsible for managing the workload and business processes may set and change specific policies from time to time to best satisfy the needs of the business or other consumer of data processing resources. Based on the policies applied to the determined overflow condition the workload manager may determine that the appropriate response to the overflow condition is to process the workload overflow with provider services on the provider side of a hybrid cloud operation .

If it is decided at operation to process the workload overflow with provider services the workload manager may invoke the cloud service broker plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator for provisioning the required services on the provider resources operation . Workload specific services may need to be provisioned and configured and appropriate data made available for processing a portion of the consumer workload using provider data processing resources. Operation may be performed using the cloud service broker application programming interface. The cloud service broker plug in then may provision the required services for the workload overflow using the provider resources operation . Operation may include invoking by the cloud service broker the provider s service provisioning specific application programming interface to provision the desired service on the provider side of the hybrid cloud on behalf of the workload manager. When the appropriate service is provisioned a handle to the provisioned service on the provider data processing resources may be made available to the cloud service broker. The cloud service broker may return the handle to the provisioned services to the workload manager operation . The handle allows the workload manager to make use of the provisioned resources for workload processing. For example if the service provisioned by the cloud service broker is an infrastructure as a service a virtual machine instance may be created from a specified image and provisioned with the requested amount of processing units random access memory and disk capacity. The virtual machine instance may be assigned an instance identity number and a network address. Access to the service may be granted to a workload specific user. The cloud service broker passes this information to the workload manager.

The provisioned services may be configured to process an overflow portion of the consumer s workload on the provider resources operation . Operation may be performed by the workload manager and may include for example initializing the service by providing specific workload parameters providing access credentials setting up secure connectivity between the consumer s data processing resources services and data sources and the newly provisioned service on the provider data processing resources and making portions of the consumer s workload available for processing by the newly provisioned service. After configuring the provisioned services processing of the workload including the newly provisioned services may be started operation . For example the effect of operations through may be to shift processing of a portion of the consumer s workload from consumer data processing resources on the consumer side of a hybrid cloud to provider data processing resources on the provider side of the hybrid cloud in response to detecting an overflow condition on the consumer s data processing resources.

The workload manager may inform the event correlation service of the new topology for processing the workload including the new service instance. For example a handle for the newly provisioned service may be sent to the event correlation service operation . The handle allows the event correlation service to monitor workload processing on the newly provisioned service. The handle may provide information such as the service identity associated with the newly provisioned service so that the event correlation service can include that service as it aggregates monitored data and correlates events across the hybrid cloud. The workload manager may send the handle to the event correlation service as part of or along with a service fulfillment response indicating that the service request from the event correlation service has been processed and fulfilled.

Monitoring of the new service instance may be started and added to monitoring of the hybrid cloud by enabling a provider side monitoring gateway to receive monitored data from the new service instance operation . Establishing monitoring of a new service instance on the provider side of a hybrid cloud is described in more detail above with reference to . Monitored data from existing service instances and from the newly provisioned service instances may then be processed and events correlated across all service instances processing the consumer s workload operation with the process terminating thereafter. Operation may include monitoring data and correlating events across service instances on both the consumer side and the provider side of a hybrid cloud.

Returning to operation in response to determining that a workload overflow threshold has not been exceeded the process may continue determining whether a workload overflow threshold has been exceeded until a determination is made.

Returning to operation if a determination has been made not to process the workload overflow with provider services the process may return to operation to continue monitoring the workload and correlating the detected events.

Turning now to illustrations of a flowchart of a process for workload underflow management are depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process of may be implemented for example in data processing environment using hybrid cloud integrator in . The process in is an example of workload underflow management in accordance with an illustrative embodiment in which a consumer workload may be processed in part on a consumer side of a hybrid cloud and in part on a provider side of the hybrid cloud.

Managing workload underflow in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may begin with setting up a hybrid cloud integrator with cloud service broker and monitoring plug ins as described above operation . The cloud service broker plug in may be configured and set up for integrating with provider services on the provider side of a hybrid cloud operation . The monitoring plug in may be set up and configured to establish hybrid cloud monitoring across data processing services on the provider side and on a consumer side of the hybrid cloud operation . Operation may be implemented for example using the process illustrated in .

An event correlation service may be set up and configured operation . The event correlation service aggregates and correlates monitored data from the consumer data processing resources and services and the provider data processing resources and services that are processing the consumer workload. The event correlation service may be set up and configured for aggregating and correlating events that are specific to the workloads being processed. For example operation may include instantiating one or more instances of a number of event correlation software plug ins in the event correlation service. Instantiation of the various event correlation software instances may be accomplished via an application programming interface provided by an event correlation service software framework.

One or more workload underflow thresholds may be defined operation . The workload underflow thresholds may be defined based on a number of policies for operating a hybrid cloud to process the consumer workload. The workload underflow thresholds may be defined by workload specific parameters for a number of the event correlation software instances instantiated in operation . For example operation may include defining workload specific parameters for the number of event correlation software instances via the application programming interface provided by the event correlation service software framework.

A workload manager may then be set up and configured and processing of the workload may be started operation . The workload manager may initialize workload processing by provisioning and configuring sufficient resources and services on the consumer side of a hybrid cloud to meet the consumer s workload demand. In accordance with an illustrative embodiment the workload manager also may use the services and resources on the provider side of the hybrid cloud for workload processing. The distribution of the consumer s workload between the consumer side and the provider side of a hybrid cloud may be defined by a number of policies. The workload manager keeps track of the various portions of the consumer workload that are being processed on the consumer s data processing resources and on provider data processing resources. Operation may include making the workload manager aware that the event correlation service is correlating and aggregating monitored events from across the hybrid cloud as the workload is being processed.

Monitoring of the workload and correlation of detected events is started operation . As a workload is processed on the consumer s data processing resources and perhaps also on provider data processing resources the event correlation service may continuously aggregate and correlate detected events across multiple monitored resources. For example such event correlation and aggregation may be provided by the number of event correlation software instances in the event correlation service.

Based on event aggregation and correlation by the event correlation service it may be determined that a workload underflow threshold has been reached operation . For example operation may be performed by an event correlation software instance in the event correlation service using a workload underflow threshold defined by workload specific parameters. In response to the determination that a workload underflow threshold has been reached a service request may be sent to the workload manager operation . The service request may provide information on the underflow situation including an indication of the degree of severity of the situation or an expected trend. This information may be provided by the event correlation service based on an evaluation of detected events. For example the service request may be generated by the event correlation service software instance detecting the underflow condition. The workload manager may receive the service request and send an acknowledgment operation . For example upon receiving the service request the workload manager may send a response to the event correlation service to indicate that the service request has been received.

The workload manager may then process the service request apply policies and determine the appropriate action to take in response to the underflow condition based on the applied policies operation . Information technology administrators business decision makers and others responsible for managing the workload and business processes may set and change specific policies from time to time to best satisfy the needs of the business or other consumer of data processing resources. Based on the policies applied to the determined underflow condition the workload manager may determine that the appropriate response to the underflow condition is to release provider services on the provider side of a hybrid cloud operation . Releasing of resources may be possible because the determination of an underflow condition indicates that at least some resources in the hybrid cloud may not be fully utilized. Releasing unneeded provider resources may eliminate ongoing costs associated with provider data processing services. In response to a determination that the appropriate response to the underflow condition is to release provider services the workload manager may move processing of a portion of the workload from the provider resources to be released and start processing more of the workload on other resources operation . For example operation may include moving processing of a portion of the consumer workload from the provider resources to be released to currently underutilized data processing resources on the consumer side of the hybrid cloud.

The workload manager may invoke the cloud service broker plug in in the hybrid cloud integrator for releasing a number of services on the provider resources operation . Operation may be performed using the cloud service broker application programming interface. The cloud service broker plug in may then release the unused services on the provider resources resulting from the workload underflow condition operation . Operation may include the cloud service broker invoking the provider s service provisioning specific application programming interface to release the desired service on the provider side of the hybrid cloud on behalf of the workload manager.

When a provider side service is released the handle to the released service on the provider data processing resources may be removed from the workload manager operation . For example the cloud service broker may send a notification to the workload manager indicating the release of the specific service on the provider side of the hybrid cloud. In turn the workload manager may send a service fulfillment response to the event correlation service indicating completion of the transaction that was initiated by the event correlation service with the notification of the underflow condition. Removing the handle from the workload manager prevents the workload manager from attempting to use the released service for processing of the consumer workload.

The workload manager may inform the event correlation service of the new topology for processing the workload. For example a handle for the newly released service also may be removed from the event correlation service operation . Removing the handle from the event correlation service prevents the event correlation service from attempting to detect events in the released service. Detecting events in a released service instance may be disabled by disabling the receiving of monitored data from the released service instance by a provider side monitoring gateway operation . Stopping monitoring of a service instance on the provider side of a hybrid cloud is described in more detail above with reference to . Monitored data from remaining service instances across the hybrid cloud may continue to be processed and events correlated across all service instances processing the consumer s workload operation with the process terminating thereafter. Operation may include monitoring data and correlating events across service instances on both the consumer side and the provider side of a hybrid cloud.

Hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment provides a well defined method and apparatus for integrating on premise infrastructure platform applications and data with off premise cloud based infrastructure platform services and data. A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment provides a structured framework of interfaces for hybrid cloud service configuration and deployment of service plug ins. Using these interfaces and application programming interfaces hybrid cloud service plug ins may be defined configured and deployed to create integrated hybrid cloud services.

Hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration capabilities across a hybrid cloud comprising any combination of data processing resources. In one example described in detail herein a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across a hybrid cloud comprising a consumer s private cloud and a provider s pubic cloud. However hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration capabilities for various other types of hybrid clouds. For example a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across a hybrid cloud comprising multiple private clouds. As another example a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across a hybrid cloud comprising multiple public clouds.

Each line of business within a single enterprise may have its own data processing resources implemented as a private cloud. Each such private cloud may have its own point of delivery and point of control. Multiple private clouds of this type may be integrated into a single hybrid cloud and made available to a consumer of data processing resources within the enterprise. A hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to provide integration across such a hybrid cloud. A hybrid cloud formed by integrating private cloud services across multiple private clouds using a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment allows a consumer of resources of one private cloud to consume from the consumer s point of delivery resources and services made available on another private cloud. The hybrid cloud integrator may be configured to allow administrators of each private cloud to manage their clouds from their respective points of control. Hybrid cloud integrator plug in services in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be configured to allow the consumer of data processing resources to enforce the same security monitoring and governance requirements on the consumer s data processing operations performed across the hybrid cloud wherever the consumer s workload is being processed. Thus using a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment workload management may be achieved in a hybrid cloud formed across multiple private clouds.

As another example hybrid cloud integration in accordance with an illustrative embodiment may be used to integrate across a hybrid cloud between two or more public clouds. In this case use of a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment allows a consumer of data processing resources of one public cloud to perform and control consumer data processing operations by coordinating and consuming resources and services from multiple public clouds using a single point of delivery and point of control. Plug in components in the hybrid cloud integrator may be configured to allow the consumer to enforce the same security monitoring and governance requirements on the consumer s data processing operations performed across the hybrid cloud wherever the consumer s workload is being processed. Thus using a hybrid cloud integrator in accordance with an illustrative embodiment workload management may be achieved in a hybrid cloud formed across multiple public clouds.
