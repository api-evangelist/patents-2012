Embodiments disclosed herein are related to systems and methods for authenticating a user using low quality and high quality authentication information. In particular systems and methods disclosed herein may implement a tiered authentication system wherein requests for certain services require a user to provide high quality authentication information and other services only require a user to provide low quality authentication information.

Network enabled computing systems are becoming more and more prevalent in the daily lives and activities of people. Where once people would congregate around a television radio newspaper or book people now congregate around personal computers tablet computers smartphones and set top boxes such as video gaming systems. Each of these computing systems typically is tied to a specific user in some way and in many cases there are a number of accounts associated with each user on a computing system. When multiple users are using the computing system this can be problematic as the user or owner of the computing system may be authenticated to one or more accounts at any time. If the user or owner permits another user to use the computing system that other user may now have access to the accounts that the user or owner may be authenticated to. The other user may then be able to conduct financial transactions send e mail and perform other functions using the user or owner s authenticated accounts. In many cases the other user may not be intending anything malicious but actually attempting to access their own account and perform functions associated with that account. A common solution is to have the user or owner log out of their accounts before letting the other user use their computing system and then authenticate to each of these accounts after the other user has completed their use of the computing system. However this can be frustrating and time consuming to users. Moreover if the other user had authenticated to any of their accounts while using the computing system the other user will also have to log out of each account that they had authenticated to and then perform a full authentication if they use the computing system again.

Accordingly there is a need for devices systems and methods for authenticating a user using low quality information and high quality information such that certain services only require the user to provide low quality information in order to be authenticated.

In the following description specific details are set forth describing certain embodiments. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the disclosed embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. The specific embodiments presented are meant to be illustrative but not limiting. One skilled in the art may realize other material that although not specifically described herein is within the scope and spirit of this disclosure.

As discussed above the need to continually log in log out authenticate re authenticate to accounts for security purposes when multiple users are using a computing system may be time consuming and frustrating to users. However modern computing systems typically include a number of ways to monitor information about the users such that devices systems and methods can use this user information to determine a relative identity of the current user. This user information may be used in a way that creates a tiered authentication system where certain actions require high quality authentication such as fingerprint or other biometric identification and other actions only require low quality authentication such as image recognition or characteristic accelerometer data. By using the tiered authentication system the computing system will be able to determine if an authenticated user is currently using the computing system and prevent another user from performing certain actions if the other user is unable to pass a certain tier of authentication.

Consistent with some embodiments user using computing system that may correspond to either client mobile device or client computing device may wish to interact with remote server . In order to access services offered by remote server user may be required to authenticate to remote server . Such authentication may be a high quality authentication such as providing credentials such as a user name and password or providing biometric information such as a fingerprint scan or an iris scan. Once a high quality authentication has been performed user may be permitted limited interaction with remote server based on low quality authentication such as image recognition accelerometer data a measured finger size voice recognition and geographical location. The low quality authentication may be performed on demand or periodically and may be performed automatically. The limited interaction may be set by user or by remote server such that certain minor or unimportant actions may be performed even if user fails the low quality authentication possibly indicating a different user while important or major interactions require uninterrupted periods of successful low quality authentication or additional high quality authentications. The limit on interactions may refer to monetary amounts when monetary transactions are involved or credential access if user settings are involved

Referring back to if remote server is unable to successfully authenticate user using high quality authentication the authentication fails and remote server may require user to attempt authentication again. If remote server successfully authenticates user remote server may perform low quality authentication . According to some embodiments the authentication may be periodic and remote server may require that client mobile device or client computing device use sensor applications or and sensor components to obtain information for use in low quality authentication that may be transmitted to remote server . The information for low quality authentication may be obtained periodically and or obtained automatically by client mobile device or client computing device . Sensor information may include images motions global positions or additional biometric information of user . For example sensor components may include a camera or other imaging component wherein sensor applications or will periodically capture an image of user and compare each image to a previous image to determine if user remains the same. Using image recognition techniques facial features hair or eye color or clothing colors may be compared to determine if user is using computing system . Alternatively sensor components may include an accelerometer wherein sensor applications or may measure an acceleration of client computing system as it is used by user to determine information about how user handles computing system . In addition if user is using client mobile device sensor application may use accelerometer to determine a gait of user to distinguish from the gait of other users. Sensor components may also include a global positioning system GPS sensor that measures the global position of computing system . Sensor applications or may periodically monitor the global position of computing system to determine movement of computing system which could be indicative of user no longer being in control of computing system or user no longer being within a secure environment whereas a stable global position of computing system may indicate that computing system remains in control of user . Sensor components may also determine how user interacts with client mobile device or client computing device . For example if client mobile device includes a touch screen user may interact with the touch screen in a particular way that is capturable by sensor components and may be used in low quality authentication. These low quality authentication techniques provided by sensor components are provided for example only and are not limiting. Any information that could be captured by sensor components individually or in combination could be used to provide low quality authentication. Low quality authentication may also include multiple levels of authentication that is weaker and less secure than high quality authentication the levels of authentication corresponding to their relative strength and security.

Returning to remote server may receive a request for a service from user through client mobile device or client computing device . After receiving such a request remote server may determine if the service requires a high quality authentication for allowing the service . Consistent with some embodiments user or remote server may designate certain services as requiring high quality authentication. Such services may be account management services monetary transactions above a certain predetermined amount services requested after a low quality authentication has failed services requested after a predetermined amount of time has passed since the last high quality authentications. Remote server may designate such services based on user history or the type of service being requested. illustrates a method for determining if a service requires high quality authentication according to some embodiments and will be discussed in greater detail below. If remote server determines that the requested service does not require high quality authentication remote server may permit the requested service . However if remote server determines that the requested service requires high quality authentication remote server will require that user perform high quality authentication . While the steps shown in are described as being performed by remote server some steps may be performed locally by client mobile device or client computing device alone or in combination with remote server .

Returning to regardless of the type of authentication performed low quality or high quality remote server will determine if user passes the authentication . Determining if user passes the authentication may include determining if high quality or low quality information provided by user over network through client mobile device or client computing device matches information stored on remote server . If user passes the authentication remote server will allow the request for the service . If user does not pass the authentication remote server may first determine if the requested service requires successful authentication . According to some embodiments user or remote server may determine that certain services are so insignificant that successful authentication is not required. If the service does not require successful authentication and user failed the authentication the request will be allowed . However if the request for service does require successful authentication and user failed the authentication remote server will deny request and then repeat the method when receiving another request for service requiring authentication . While the steps shown in are described as being performed by remote server some steps may be performed locally by client mobile device or client computing device alone or in combination with remote server .

As shown in user may perform an initial high quality authentication to begin a session . Consistent with some embodiments user may authenticate to remote server for accessing and utilizing services provided by remote server wherein a successful authentication will begin a session with remote server . The session may have a predetermined time limit after which the session will expire. Once user has successfully performed the initial high quality authentication the method may make a series of checks to determine if the session may be extended by user . For example a check may be made to determine if user is requesting a service or taking an action that requires high quality authentication . When user requests a service or takes an action remote server may perform a series of checks such as shown in to determine if the requested service requires high quality authentication. If the requested service requires high quality authentication high quality authentication will be performed a determination as to whether user passes the high quality authentication will be made wherein user will be denied the service if user fails the authentication and the service will be permitted if user passes the authentication . Consistent with some embodiments high quality authentication may include receiving specific user credentials such as a password and user name and matching the credentials to user credentials stored in remote server or on a local device such as client mobile device or client computing device . High quality authentication may also include receiving biometric information such as a fingerprint scan iris scan or other biometric information and matching the received biometric information with biometric information stored on remote server or on a local device such as client mobile device or client computing device . High quality authentication may also include multiple levels of authentication that is stronger and more secure than low quality authentication the levels of authentication corresponding to their relative strength and security.

Returning to a periodic check may be made to determine if the session is expiring . If the session is expiring a check is made to determine if the session is extendable . As discussed above a session may be extendable for a predetermined amount of time or a predetermined number of extensions. If the session is not extendable user will be required to perform a higher quality authentication in order to extend the session wherein a determination as to whether user passes the high quality authentication will be made wherein the session will end if user fails the authentication and the session will be extended if user passes the authentication . If the session is extendable user may be able to extend the session by performing low quality authentication . Low quality authentication may require that client mobile device or client computing device using sensor applications or and sensor components to obtain information for use in low quality authentication that may be transmitted to remote server . The information may be obtained periodically and or automatically by client mobile device or client computing device . Sensor information may include images motions global positions or additional biometric information of user . Low quality authentication may also include multiple levels of authentication that is weaker and less secure than high quality authentication the levels of authentication corresponding to their relative strength and security. After performing low quality authentication a determination will be made to see if user passes the authentication wherein if user passes the low quality authentication the session will be extended . If user fails the low quality authentication user will be required to perform a higher quality authentication to extend the session wherein a determination as to whether user passes the high quality authentication will be made wherein the session will end if user fails the authentication and the session will be extended if user passes the authentication . While the steps shown in are described as being performed by remote server some steps may be performed locally by client mobile device or client computing device alone or in combination with remote server .
