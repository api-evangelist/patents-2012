This application is a continuation application which claims benefit of and priority to co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 332 633 titled Fantasy Open Platform Environment filed on Dec. 21 2011 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

A fantasy game is one where participants act as an owner to build a team that competes against other fantasy owners based on statistics generated by real individual players of a game. Fantasy sport is a class of fantasy games. For instance a fantasy owner might draft a fantasy football team to compete with other fantasy football teams based on statistics generated by real football players from the National Football League NFL . A common variant uses a computer model to convert statistical performance into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster selected by a manager of a fantasy team. As with a real team a fantasy owner is given various online tools to sign trade and cut fantasy players just like a real team owner.

As popularity of fantasy games increase a plethora of specialized fantasy applications are developing to support various aspects of a fantasy game. Fantasy games are difficult to learn and win and therefore fantasy gamers are always looking for an edge over the competition. For instance before a game season begins fantasy owners may gather to draft real players for their fantasy teams. The draft typically involves a complex weighing of multiple factors to make a draft decision within a limited period of time. A number of specialized fantasy applications are available that are specifically designed to assist a fantasy owner in drafting players. A fantasy owner may utilize other specialized fantasy applications as well such as applications designed to customize starting lineups for a game project player performance automatically negotiate trades and so forth.

One problem associated with the proliferation of specialized fantasy software applications however is that it creates a disjointed program environment for a fantasy owner. Specialized fantasy applications are not designed to interoperate with each other and often use completely different sets of fantasy data. As such each specialized fantasy application is designed with a unique user interface that is presented in a separate portion of a display such as a user interface frame. It is not uncommon for a fantasy gamer to have multiple applications running simultaneously on a computer with each application having its own user interface frame and constantly switching focus between each frame to gather information needed to play one or more fantasy games. Furthermore some specialized fantasy applications may be native applications installed and executing on a client device while others are web applications executing on a server device. To engage in a game session a fantasy gamer may need to search and select the native programs through a program manager to execute the native applications and launch a web browser and select a uniform resource locator URL to execute the web applications each of which may have separate accounts payment methods security credentials subscription managers authentication procedures resource requirements and so forth. Layer on the fact that many fantasy gamers are frequently playing multiple teams on multiple sites and this segmented program environment becomes even more disjointed. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present improvements have been needed.

Various embodiments are generally directed to fantasy games. Some embodiments are particularly directed to a fantasy open platform environment arranged to aggregate heterogeneous fantasy applications fantasy content and fantasy data for fantasy games into a unified fantasy framework with a homogeneous user interface.

In general a game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict defined by rules and a scoring system resulting in a quantifiable outcome. A fantasy game is a game based on a quantifiable outcome of another game. More particularly a fantasy game uses a scoring system that is based at least in part on a quantifiable outcome of another game in order to obtain a quantifiable outcome for the fantasy game. For instance a fantasy sport game may comprise a fantasy team selected from human players of a real sport. The fantasy sport game may convert statistical information of human player performance in real sporting competitions e.g. a football game a baseball game etc. into points that are compiled and totaled according to a roster of a fantasy team. Fantasy players of the fantasy sport game then compete based on the totaled points.

Fantasy games may be based on any type or genre of games. Some examples of games may include without limitation sports board games video games games of chance lawn games tabletop games party games dexterity games coordination games card games dice games domino and tile games guessing games video games electronic games electronic video games online games role playing games business games simulation games television games reality television games artificial reality games and so forth. A fantasy game may be based on any of these or other types of games. A particularly large segment of fantasy games focus on sports such as football basketball baseball soccer hockey racing and so forth. Recently emerging fantasy game genres have branched out to include non sports related games focused on politics celebrity gossip movies and reality television. For instance fantasy congress is a fantasy game where players called citizens could draft members of the United States House and Senate and keep track of their participation within the U.S. Congress. Actions especially within the process of making and amending pieces of legislation of a player s drafted congresspersons are recorded and rated as a cumulative total amount of points against other players. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

Fantasy games may have many fantasy game genres. For example fantasy sport is a class of fantasy games. A fantasy owner might draft a fantasy football team to compete with other fantasy football teams based on statistics generated by real football players from the National Football League NFL . Fantasy reality TV is another class of fantasy games. For instance a fantasy owner might draft a fantasy reality team to compete with other fantasy reality teams based on statistics generated by reality show contestants such as contestants for such reality shows as Big Brother Survivor American Idol Dancing With The Stars The Apprentice Fear Factor The Amazing Race and so forth. Fantasy board is another class of fantasy games. For instance a fantasy owner might draft a fantasy board game team to compete with other fantasy board game teams based on statistics generated by board game contestants such as chess players poker players checker players monopoly players or other board games. Fantasy electronic is another class of fantasy games. For instance a fantasy owner might draft a fantasy electronic game team to compete with other fantasy electronic game teams based on statistics generated by electronic game contestants such as electronic video game players electronic gambling game players and other electronic games. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

As previously described one problem associated with proliferation of specialized fantasy software applications to support fantasy games is that it creates a disjointed gaming environment for a fantasy player. Embodiments provide a fantasy open platform environment arranged to aggregate heterogeneous fantasy applications fantasy content and fantasy data into a unified fantasy framework with a homogeneous user interface. The unified fantasy framework provides several advantages to fantasy gamers fantasy application developers and fantasy advertisers.

A fantasy gamer may use the unified fantasy framework to access and use multiple types of fantasy applications developed or provided by different software vendors within a single user interface view. As such a fantasy gamer does not have to leave a fantasy gaming context in order to access services and features offered by different software vendors or engage in the separate access requirements typically associate with different software products. Further the different types of fantasy applications may operate on a shared set of fantasy data or different sets of fantasy data stored by a single fantasy database managed by the unified fantasy framework. In this manner a fantasy gamer may view and in some cases change a same set of fantasy data surfaced by different fantasy applications even when some fantasy applications are hosted by third party servers. In addition a fantasy user may access fantasy content such as fantasy news and commentary from various content providers through the single user interface view. In this manner a fantasy gamer may access heterogeneous fantasy applications and content from different sources through a single user interface view without having to switch between different viewing contexts. As a result a fantasy gamer will be more competitive entertained and have a richer gaming experience.

A fantasy application developer may use the unified fantasy framework to develop and market fantasy applications to a wider range of fantasy gamers. Rather than attempting to market and monetize a specialized fantasy application through its own e commerce web servers to a smaller market fantasy application developers may advertise and target fantasy gamers attracted by the robustness and convenience of the unified fantasy framework. Furthermore rather than offering stand alone applications that need to be purchased installed and executed by a user as native applications fantasy application developers may focus on developing web applications sold and access through the unified fantasy framework thereby enhancing subscription services advertising revenue software updates and distribution mechanisms. In addition a fantasy application developer may potentially participate in advertisement revenue sharing splits negotiated between a provider of the unified fantasy framework and various advertisers.

A fantasy advertiser may use the unified fantasy framework for targeted advertising campaigns to a wide range of fantasy gamers attracted by the robustness and convenience of the unified fantasy framework and also the multiplicity of specialized fantasy applications. Further the fantasy advertiser may have more information as to browsing and purchasing patterns of fantasy gamers across a wide array of fantasy applications and fantasy content. This information may be used to provide more finely targeted advertisements to select segments of fantasy gamers.

These and other advantages may be realized through a fantasy server application arranged to manage the unified fantasy framework. The fantasy server application may generate a dynamic resource document such as an information resource or web page having various discrete portions allocated to different fantasy applications. Each discrete portion may present a different resource document from a different fantasy application. The different fantasy applications may be native to the unified fantasy framework or external to the unified fantasy framework such as third party software vendors. The different resource documents may include fantasy content from a single fantasy content database. This may occur even when the different fantasy applications are developed and owned by different entities. As a result the embodiments can improve affordability scalability modularity extendibility or interoperability for an operator device or network.

With general reference to notations and nomenclature used herein the detailed descriptions which follow may be presented in terms of program procedures executed on a computer or network of computers. These procedural descriptions and representations are used by those skilled in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art.

A procedure is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. These operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It proves convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like. It should be noted however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to those quantities.

Further the manipulations performed are often referred to in terms such as adding or comparing which are commonly associated with mental operations performed by a human operator. No such capability of a human operator is necessary or desirable in most cases in any of the operations described herein which form part of one or more embodiments. Rather the operations are machine operations. Useful machines for performing operations of various embodiments include general purpose digital computers or similar devices.

Various embodiments also relate to apparatus or systems for performing these operations. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purpose or it may comprise a general purpose computer as selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. The procedures presented herein are not inherently related to a particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose machines may be used with programs written in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these machines will appear from the description given.

Reference is now made to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident however that the novel embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof. The intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives consistent with the claimed subject matter.

In one embodiment the fantasy open platform apparatus may comprise a computer implemented apparatus having a fantasy server application comprising one or more components . Although the fantasy open platform apparatus shown in has a limited number of elements in a certain topology it may be appreciated that the fantasy open platform apparatus may include more or less elements in alternate topologies as desired for a given implementation.

It is worthy to note that a and b and c and similar designators as used herein are intended to be variables representing any positive integer. Thus for example if an implementation sets a value for a 7 then a complete set of components for the fantasy server application may include components and . The embodiments are not limited in this context.

The fantasy open platform apparatus may comprise the fantasy server application . In the illustrated embodiment shown in the fantasy server application may comprise a fantasy game component a platform generator component a host manager component and a guest manager component among other components 

The fantasy server application may be generally arranged to receive as input a resource document request and generate as output a dynamic resource document with fantasy content from a fantasy content database for a fantasy game. The resource document request may be received from a client device such as from a web browser implemented by the client device.

Fantasy content may generally refer to any content associate with or suitable for one or more fantasy games. Examples of fantasy content may include without limitation fantasy game data fantasy play data user data for a fantasy game multimedia content for fantasy games e.g. video files audio files images pictures news articles etc. game management data subscription information user profiles player data team rosters league rosters fantasy game results historical data statistical data price data win rates loss rates and any other data associated with a fantasy game. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

A dynamic resource document is a document or information resource that is suitable for presentation on a display. In one embodiment for example a dynamic resource document is an information resource that is suitable for the world wide web WWW and can be accessed through a web browser such as a web page. A web page is a document coded in a markup language and may provide navigation to other web pages via hypertext links. A web page may comprise a static web page having files of static text and other content stored within a file system for a web server. A web page may comprise a dynamic web page constructed by server side software when they are requested. A web page may subsume other resources such as style sheets scripts and images into their final presentation. For instance a web page may utilize client side scripting to make the web page more responsive to user input once on a client browser. In one embodiment a dynamic resource document may be implemented as a dynamic web page.

A markup language is a modern system for annotating a text in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from that text. Some markup languages like hypertext markup language HTML have presentation semantics meaning their specification prescribes how the structured data is to be presented but other markup languages like extensible markup language XML have no predefined semantics. In either case markup tags used by the markup language are typically omitted from the version of the text which is displayed for end user consumption. Examples of markup languages suitable for a dynamic resource document may include without limitation a generalized markup language GML standard generalized markup language SGML HTML XML extensible HTML XHTML or variants of each. For instance there are numerous variants of XML that have been customized for different applications or protocols. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

The fantasy server application may comprise a fantasy game component . The fantasy game component may be generally arranged to provide manage or coordinate one or more fantasy games for the fantasy server application . A fantasy game may comprise or be implemented as any type of fantasy game from any type of fantasy game genre as previously described. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

The fantasy server application may comprise a platform generator component . The platform generator component may be generally arranged to generate a dynamic resource document for a fantasy game managed by the fantasy game component . The platform generator component may retrieve information from various applications databases and servers of the unified fantasy framework and organize the retrieved information into a dynamic resource document in a way that is easily consumed by a fantasy player through a client device.

The fantasy server application may comprise a host manager component . The host manager component may be generally arranged to manage information suitable for a dynamic resource document that is sourced from fantasy applications that are native to the unified fantasy framework. The host manager component may automatically retrieve and format this information for inclusion in a dynamic resource document .

The fantasy server application may comprise a guest manager component . The guest manager component may be generally arranged to manage information suitable for a dynamic resource document that is sourced from fantasy applications that are not native to the unified fantasy framework. In one embodiment the guest manager component may automatically retrieve and format this information for inclusion in a dynamic resource document . In one embodiment the guest manager component may automatically generate a reference to this information and not the actual information for inclusion in a dynamic resource document .

Once the fantasy server application generates a dynamic resource document the fantasy server application may send the dynamic resource document to a requesting entity that originally sent a resource document request such as a web browser of a client device. The web browser may then render the dynamic resource document for presentation to a user.

As shown in the platform generator component may be arranged to receive a page request . The fantasy server application may generate a page request in response to a resource document request from a client device. The platform generator component may generate a platform resource document . The platform resource document may be a general surface or template that can be populated with different types of information from various sources.

A platform resource document may have multiple segments of different segment types to accommodate the different types of information. A segment may generally comprise a discrete portion of a platform resource document such as a frame or group box. In the context of graphical user interface GUI a frame surrounds a collection of GUI elements. In the context of a web page a frame may also surround a collection of GUI elements. In addition a web page frame allows a user interface of a visual browser window to be split into discrete portions each of which can show a different document or portion of a document . This can lower bandwidth use as repeating parts of a layout can be used in one frame while variable content is display in another frame.

When using web browsers the terms frame or frameset or framing generally refer to the display of two or more web pages or media elements displayed within a same visual browser window. The two or more web pages may be positioned adjacent to each other or one web page may be embedded within another web page. The web pages or media elements may come from the same web site or from multiple different web sites. In one sense a frame allows a web page to be presented within a larger web page. A framed web page may have dedicated user interface controls to allow manipulation of the framed web page such as a scroll bar to individually scroll the framed web page without moving a framing web page presenting the framed web page. Implementation of a frame may vary according to a given markup language used to construct a platform resource document and or a dynamic resource document .

In one embodiment a segment may comprise a frame for a HTML document. A HTML document may have a general frame for a HTML document and an inline frame for another HTML document within the general frame. In HTML the inline frame may be defined by an iframe element which controls attributes of an inline frame such as attributes used to define an inline frame layout e.g. rows and cols attributes . An inline frame can be a target frame for links or references defined by other elements and can be selected by a user as a focus for viewing a HTML document in the inline frame printing copying and so forth. Although some embodiments may refer to an inline frame as an example of a segment for a platform resource document it may be appreciated that other framing elements defined by other markup languages may be used as well. For instance a platform resource document generated in an XML format may utilize XFrames for combining and organizing web based documents together in a single webpage through the use of frames. In other examples segments may be constructed using cascading style sheets CSS server side scripting languages e.g. server side includes SSI hypertext preprocessor PHP and other scripting languages and other techniques. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

The resource manager component may be arranged to manage access to fantasy content of the fantasy content database in response to a message request from the guest server program of the server device such as a message request to read fantasy content from the fantasy content database write fantasy content to the fantasy content database or a combination of both. The resource manager component may be described in more detail with reference to .

In the illustrated embodiment shown in a set of client devices may comprise client devices and . The client devices may comprise representative examples of the client device . As shown in each client device may representing a different electronic device a user can utilize to access a web services and web applications provided by a fantasy web server . For instance the client device may comprise a desktop computer the client device may comprise a notebook computer and the client device may comprise a smart phone. It may be appreciated that these are merely a few examples of client devices and any of the electronic devices as described with reference to may be implemented as a client device . The embodiments are not limited in this context.

A user may utilize a client device to access various web services and web applications provided by the fantasy web server . The fantasy web server may be a representative example of the server device . More particularly the fantasy web server may comprise the server device implemented as a web server using various web technologies. The fantasy web server may comprise a stand alone server or an array of servers in a modular server architecture or server farm.

The fantasy web server may comprise hardware and software designed to deliver content that can be accessed through a network such as a network implementing one or more communications protocols from a suite of Internet protocols as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF commonly referred to as the Internet. The fantasy web server may host various web sites which are collections of web pages. The fantasy web server may deliver web pages on requests from the client devices made through a web browser such as the web browser . For example the fantasy web server may deliver static or dynamic web pages generated by the fantasy open platform apparatus .

To generate a web page the fantasy web server may retrieve fantasy content from the fantasy content database implemented by the database server . The database server may implement various database technologies arranged to store update retrieve and or manage various types of fantasy content from the fantasy content database such as a database management system DBMS comprising database management software and network storage units. For instance the fantasy content database may be implemented as multiple network storage units operating as a storage area network SAN .

A user may also utilize a client device to access various web services and web applications provided by the guest web server . The guest web server may be a representative example of the server device . More particularly the guest web server may comprise the server device implemented as a web server using various web technologies. The guest web server may comprise a stand alone server or an array of servers in a modular server architecture or server farm.

Similar to the fantasy web server the guest web server may comprise hardware and software designed to deliver content that can be accessed through a network such as a network implementing one or more communications protocols from a suite of Internet protocols as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF commonly referred to as the Internet. The guest web server may host various web sites which are collections of web pages. The guest web server may deliver web pages on requests from the client devices made through a web browser such as the web browser . For example the guest web server may deliver static or dynamic web pages generated by the guest server programs 

The fantasy web server may also communicate with one or more advertisement servers . The advertisement servers may be arranged for serving advertisements on behalf of one or more advertisers. An advertiser may be any entity that generates advertising material to advertise product or services to be sold by a vendor. The advertisement servers may be owned by a vendor such as an internal marketing department for a business or enterprise.

The fantasy web server may further communicate with one or more application development servers . The application development servers may be used for application development of one or more guest server programs as implemented by the guest web server . Application developers such as computer programmers or software engineers may utilize various developer devices to access the application development server to access application development software providing an application development framework or architecture suitable for design a given type of guest server application such as a web application for example. In one embodiment for example the application development server may provide access to a software developer kit SDK for the fantasy open platform apparatus .

A SDK is typically a set of software development tools that allows for the creation of applications for a certain software package software framework hardware platform computer system operating system or similar platform. The SDK may comprise an application programming interface API in the form of some files to interface to a particular programming language or include sophisticated hardware to communicate with a certain embedded system. Common tools include debugging aids and other utilities often presented in an integrated development environment IDE . SDKs also frequently include sample code and supporting technical notes or other supporting documentation to help clarify points from the primary reference material.

The fantasy network is an exemplary implementation of a unified fantasy framework that provides a complete fantasy eco system for integrating native fantasy applications third party fantasy applications fantasy advertisements and tools for fantasy development.

A fantasy gamer may use the fantasy network to access and use multiple types of fantasy applications developed or provided by different software vendors within a single user interface view presented by the web browser . As such a fantasy gamer does not have to leave a fantasy gaming context in order to access services and features offered by different software vendors or engage in the separate access requirements typically associate with different software products. Further the different types of fantasy applications may operate on a shared set of fantasy data or different sets of fantasy data stored by a single fantasy database managed by the fantasy network . In this manner a fantasy gamer may view and in some cases change a same set of fantasy data surfaced by different fantasy applications even when some fantasy applications are hosted by third party servers such as the guest web server . In this manner a fantasy gamer may access heterogeneous fantasy applications and content from different sources through a single user interface view without having to switch between different viewing contexts. As a result a fantasy gamer will be more competitive entertained and have a richer gaming experience.

A fantasy application developer may use the application development server and the developer devices of the fantasy network to develop and market fantasy applications to a wider range of fantasy gamers. Rather than attempting to market and monetize a specialized fantasy application through its own e commerce web servers to a smaller market fantasy application developers may advertise and target fantasy gamers attracted by the robustness and convenience of the fantasy network particularly the fantasy web server . Furthermore rather than offering stand alone applications that need to be purchased installed and executed by a user as native applications fantasy application developers may focus on developing web applications sold and access through the fantasy network thereby enhancing subscription services advertising revenue software updates and distribution mechanisms. In addition a fantasy application developer may potentially participate in advertisement revenue sharing splits negotiated between a provider of the fantasy network and various advertisers operating the advertisement server .

A fantasy advertiser may use the fantasy network for targeted advertising campaigns to a wide range of fantasy gamers attracted by the robustness and convenience of the fantasy network and also the multiplicity of specialized fantasy applications accessible via the fantasy web server and the guest web server . Further the fantasy advertiser may have more information as to browsing and purchasing patterns of fantasy gamers across a wide array of fantasy applications and fantasy content. This information may be used to provide more finely targeted advertisements to select segments of fantasy gamers by inserting targeted advertisements from the advertisement server into a dynamic resource document .

It is worthy to note that although the elements of the fantasy network are shown as separate devices in it may be appreciated that some or all of the devices could all be implemented on a single physical device utilizing virtualization or cloud computing technologies. For instance some or all of the servers and could all be implemented by a single physical server or server array implementing virtualization software to logically separate the server or server array into multiple virtual machines with each virtual machine implementing each of the servers and respectively. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

As shown in the dynamic resource document comprises a host segment and a guest segment . The host segment may comprise a frame containing a host resource document . The guest segment may comprise a frame containing a guest resource document . The host resource document and the guest resource document may both contain fantasy content from the fantasy content database . In some cases the fantasy content may be homogeneous fantasy content such as the same text Cano Robinson. In other cases the fantasy content may be heterogeneous fantasy content such as Crawford Carl as presented in the guest resource document and not the host resource document . In either case the fantasy content is presented by two separate and distinct fantasy server programs one comprising the host server program and the other comprising the guest server program which is made possible through the fantasy unified fantasy framework.

It is worthy to note that the host resource document and the guest resource document are presented within a single browser window in a seamless manner. This allows a user to view both documents simultaneously without having to switch between fantasy program contexts such as different browser windows or user interface windows as with conventional fantasy programs. Further the user may manipulate the fantasy content in either document from either document using separate user controls implemented for each frame including retrieving new fantasy content or modifying existing fantasy content from either document and reading writing the fantasy content to the same fantasy content database . This allows the user to have full access and control to the native features and services offered by the host server program and the guest server program using native set of user interface controls and user interface elements offered by each of the host server program and the guest server program .

The dynamic resource document may further present a set of external content controls . The external content controls may be used to access and manipulate heterogeneous fantasy content through the fantasy server application . The heterogeneous fantasy content may have been previously retrieved from various heterogeneous fantasy content providers and hosted within the fantasy unified fantasy framework for central access by fantasy users from within the browser window . The external content controls may be presented as part of the host segment a separate host segment not shown or another segment type provided for the platform resource document and or the dynamic resource document .

As shown in the resource manager component may comprise a policy enforcer module a set of policy rules and a fantasy resource access module . The resource manager component may receive a message request from a host server program or a guest server program and manage access to fantasy content of the fantasy content database in response to the message request utilizing the policy enforcer module the set of policy rules and the fantasy resource access module . Using the resource manager component to manage access to the fantasy content database for both host server programs and guest server programs reduces access management overhead and ensures uniform access policies for heterogeneous fantasy applications.

A host server program and or a guest server program may send a message request using any number of known communications protocols and techniques. For example the message request may be sent utilizing the communications components operating in accordance with the Internet protocol suite such as HTTP TCP IP and UDP among other known protocols.

In one embodiment for example the fantasy network may utilize a representational state transfer REST architecture. REST is a software architecture style for distributed hypermedia systems such as the WWW. In a REST architecture clients initiate requests to servers and servers process and return appropriate responses. Requests and responses are built around a transfer of representations of resources. A resource is a primitive in a web architecture and is used in the definition of its fundamental elements. Client server communications may include REST information identifying a current or intended state of a resource. Since a REST architecture is a stateless architecture no client context is stored in a server between requests. Rather each request from any client contains all of the information necessary to service the request and any session state is held in the client. The server however can be stateful as long as a server side state is addressable by a URL as a resource.

When the fantasy network is implemented with a REST architecture the client devices and the various server devices may communicate messages with REST information. For instance a client device may send a message request requesting access to fantasy content of the fantasy content database . The message request may REST information conveying a current state or an intended state for the client device .

A message request may contain REST information communicated using an application layer protocol and a transport layer of an Internet protocol suite such as defined by one or more IETF standards. In one embodiment for example a message request may contain REST information communicated using HTTP and TCP. In one embodiment for example a message request may contain REST information communicated using HTTP and UDP.

The resource manager component may comprise a policy enforcer module . The policy enforcer module may control access to fantasy content of the fantasy content database . Since multiple fantasy applications are accessing the fantasy content of the fantasy content database there is always a security threat that rouge applications will attempt to improperly access fantasy content . Even in those cases where legitimate applications are attempting to access fantasy content these applications may need to be limited to isolated sets of fantasy content for privacy reasons. Further legitimate applications may intentionally or unintentionally attempt to access fantasy content in a manner that is inconsistent with rules of a particular fantasy game such as trying to acquire a player already committed to another team. This problem is exacerbated by the open architecture provided by the fantasy unified fantasy framework.

To further illustrate this problem a host server program such as a host server program is typically developed by a same entity that developed the fantasy server application . In the past the developer would tightly integrate the host server program and the fantasy server application to ensure the host server program operates consistently with the fantasy server application . For instance the host server program can be developed to conform to any security policies privacy policies or fantasy game rule policies implemented by the fantasy server application .

This tight integration between programs however comes with several disadvantages. For example changes in policy need to be made in both the host server program and the fantasy server application . In another example a new host server program needs to be developed in a very similar or identical manner as the host server program such as using a same set of APIs used by the host server program . However the programming techniques used for the host server program may not be suitable or desirable for the host server program . In yet another example this tight integration creates a closed system which may be hostile to third party software such as a guest server program for example. Essentially a developer for the fantasy server application and a developer of the guest server program would need to collaborate and replicate a custom set of APIs similar to those used by the host server program to obtain the same high level of integration between the guest server program and the fantasy server application as with the host server program and the fantasy server application .

To solve these and other problems the host server programs and guest server programs may utilize a standardized set of APIs to control interaction with the fantasy server application . A couple of examples for standardized APIs include a fantasy read resource and a fantasy write resource shown with a fantasy resource access module among others as described below. The standardized APIs provide seamless and uniform integration between the host server programs and the fantasy server application as well as the guest server programs and the fantasy server application . It basically creates an open system. As such an additional layer of enforcement is needed to protect integrity of the fantasy content stored by the fantasy content database .

The policy enforcer module is designed to prevent these and other attempts to improperly access fantasy content . The policy enforcer module may control access to fantasy content of the fantasy content database based on a set of policy rules . The policy rules are a set of rules designed to control behavior of both host server programs and guest server programs in a uniform manner.

In one embodiment the policy rules may represent a set of security policies. A security policy defines a set of constraints to control whether an entity may interact with a resource such as the fantasy content database . For instance a security policy may define security credentials e.g. security certificates authentication procedures authorization procedures encryption schemes and so forth.

In one embodiment the policy rules may represent a set of privacy policies. A privacy policy defines a set of constraints to control which specific resources within the fantasy content database an entity may access. For instance a privacy policy may define levels of permissions to certain files stored by the fantasy content database read authority for protected files e.g. user data dissemination of information in protected files protections need for dissemination of information in protected files e.g. encryption and so forth.

In one embodiment the policy rules may represent a set of fantasy game policies. A fantasy game typically has set of fantasy game rules. For instance fantasy football has different rules controlling different aspects of gameplay of fantasy football such as fantasy football league rules fantasy football team rules fantasy player rules fantasy manager rules fantasy team owner rules fantasy league owner rules player selection rules player trade rules player roster rules starting lineup rules substitution rules point system rules scoring system rules and so forth. Often the fantasy game rules are complex and detailed to ensure a high level of fair competition. Furthermore fantasy game rules typically change sometimes significantly between different fantasy games. For instance fantasy football rules are completely different from fantasy baseball rules.

The policy enforcer module may control access to fantasy content of the fantasy content database by a host server program and or a guest server program using the different security policies privacy policies and fantasy game policies defined for the unified fantasy framework. By way of example assume a user is viewing different aspects of a starting lineup for players in a fantasy baseball league presented by a host resource document and a guest resource document generated by the host server program and the guest server program respectively. Further assume a viewer attempts to add a fourth outfielder to her starting lineup by manipulating the guest resource document e.g. selecting a GUI button . A client device may send a message request to the fantasy web server . The resource manager component of the fantasy server application implemented by the fantasy web server may route the message request to the policy enforcer module . The policy enforcer module may retrieve the selection information from the message request including a fantasy baseball game identifier and a fantasy baseball league identifier. The policy enforcer module may retrieve a set of fantasy baseball game rules and a set of fantasy baseball league rules based on the respective identifiers. Some fantasy baseball league rules allow three outfielders while other fantasy baseball league rules allow four outfielders. Assume the fantasy baseball league identifier indicates a league rule that only allows three outfielders. In this case the policy enforcer module may send an error message to the web browser of the client device which surfaces a GUI message indicating the error.

The resource manager component may comprise a fantasy resource access module . The fantasy resource access module may provide access to the fantasy content of the fantasy content database . Once the policy enforcer module checks information in a message request to ensure that the requested access to the fantasy content of the fantasy content database is valid the policy enforcer module may pass the information to the fantasy resource access module to actually access the fantasy content .

The fantasy resource access module may access fantasy content of the fantasy content database in response to a message request from a host server program or a guest server program . The fantasy resource access module may contain a set of standardized APIs controlling access to the fantasy content of the fantasy content database such as read and write operations for the fantasy content . For instance the fantasy resource access module may retrieve REST information from a message request and access fantasy content of the fantasy content database using the REST information.

The fantasy resource access module may comprise a fantasy read resource arranged to read one or more fantasy content sets of the fantasy content from the fantasy content database . In one embodiment for example the fantasy read resource may be implemented as an API suitable for use with HTTP among other protocols. The fantasy read resource may be an atomic API by itself or may be implemented as part of another API directed to a specific task that includes reading fantasy content from the fantasy content database .

A sample URL for a fantasy read resource designed to read a resource comprising a draft order for a league using an HTTP GET method may be shown as follows 

The fantasy resource access module may comprise a fantasy write resource arranged to write change one or more fantasy content sets of the fantasy content to the fantasy content database . In one embodiment for example the fantasy write resource may be implemented as an API suitable for use with HTTP among other protocols. The fantasy write resource may be an atomic API by itself or may be implemented as part of another API directed to a specific task that includes writing fantasy content to the fantasy content database .

A sample URL for a fantasy write resource designed to write a resource comprising changes to a lineup for a fantasy team using an HTTP PUT method is shown as follows 

Continuing with a specific example for the sample URL for the fantasy write resource designed to write a resource comprising changes to a lineup for a fantasy team using an HTTP PUT method assume a user desires to activate or bench certain players. In this case a sample does the following 1 activate player with player ID 584808 and put him at third base 3B in the lineup 2 activate player with player ID 22234 and put him at catcher C in the lineup 3 bench player with player ID 390828 and remove him from 3B in the lineup 4 bench player with player ID 293103 and remove him from C in the lineup and 5 make moves effective 20110418. Sample PUT data to perform these lineup changes is shown as follows 

It may be appreciated that the fantasy read resource and the fantasy write resource are not limited to the previous examples. The fantasy read resource and the fantasy write resource may be implemented using other APIs as desired for a given implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

It may also be appreciated that the fantasy read resource or the fantasy write resource can read from or write to a same fantasy content set in response to requests from the host server program the guest server program or both the host server program and the guest server program . For instance this may occur when the host resource document and the guest resource document both present the fantasy content set in the browser window at a same time. Alternatively the fantasy read resource or the fantasy write resource can read from or write to different fantasy content sets in response to requests from the host server program the guest server program or both the host server program and the guest server program . For instance this may occur when the host resource document and the guest resource document each present the fantasy content set respectively in the browser window at a same time. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In order to access and use the standardized APIs offered by the fantasy resource access module a message request needs to communicate two items. The first is an access token. The second is at least one or more identifiers designed to identify a fantasy game a fantasy league and a fantasy user or a combination of all three.

For instance when a web browser of a client device receives a dynamic resource document with guest reference for a guest resource document and or a guest server program via an iframe element an access token is passed from the fantasy server application e.g. fantasy resource access module to the iframe URL of the guest resource document . The guest server program may get the access token for a user through a request for JSON such as 

The guest server program may parse the JSON or XML response to retrieve the access token and make API calls on the fantasy access resource module using the access token passed as an access token query parameter. Examples of JSON and XML calls are shown as follows 

API responses from the fantasy resource access module are available in JSON or XML using the response format parameter.

A content web server is a web server that provides access to fantasy content associated with one or more fantasy games. A content provider provides different types of content related to fantasy games such as news commentary statistics rankings fantasy player data real player data fantasy game updates real game updates and so forth. Some examples of content providers is shown in Table 1 as follows 

A fantasy player may utilize one or more client devices to access fantasy content sourced by the different content web servers . For instance a fantasy player may use a client device to check on a latest set of player rankings for his team provided by a content web server . However as with third party applications not part of the fantasy network the fantasy player would need to shift focus from a browser window and open a new browser window to access fantasy content from the web server . Again this shift in focus removes the fantasy player from a unified fantasy game context thereby increasing complexity and reducing fantasy gameplay experience. The unified fantasy framework solves these and other problems by having the fantasy web server host content from the content web servers and provides a user access to the hosted content through the browser window via a dynamic resource document thereby allowing the user to remain within the fantasy gameplay context provided by the unified fantasy framework.

As with the fantasy network it is worthy to note that although the elements of the fantasy network are shown as separate devices in it may be appreciated that some or all of the devices could all be implemented on a single physical device utilizing virtualization or cloud computing technologies. For instance some or all of the servers and could all be implemented by a single physical server or server array implementing virtualization software to logically separate the server or server array into multiple virtual machines with each virtual machine implementing each of the servers and respectively. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

As shown in content web servers may comprise external content databases respectively each managing various content files . The fantasy server application may receive or retrieve the content files from the content web servers using a push model or a pull model respectively. The push model or pull model may push or pull on a periodic aperiodic continuous or on demand basis. The content files may be stored and or delivered in a defined data schema or data format compatible to a parser component of the fantasy server application such as a comma separated values CSV document or XML document for example.

The parser component may be arranged to receive content files and parse the files for conversion into a data schema or data format suitable for storage by the database server . A data format suitable for the database server may be a data format for a given database management system DBMS used by the database server such as a relational data model used by a relational database management system RDBMS in which data is stored in tables and the relationships among the data are also stored in tables. The data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to change table forms. Converting the content files from a data schema such as XML into a relational data model facilitates access search and retrieval of the underlying content stored in the content files 

The content files can be delivered to the fantasy web server using either a web interface or programmatically using HTTP. The former technique is more suitable for smaller amounts of content while the latter technique is more suitable for larger amounts of content. To deliver content files using a web interface the content web server may use an application to submit content files using a content delivery application appropriate for a given content type sourced by the content web server . To deliver content files using a HTTP interface the content web server may use an application to submit content files using the HTTP POST method. The POST method is supported by most programming and scripting languages either natively or through a library.

A content file may have a different data format depending on a type of content stored by the content file . For instance a content file with projections could have a CSV format while a content file with rankings outlooks or updates could have a XML format. Other data formats may be used as well. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

Along with a content file the content web server should deliver such information as a player identifier a sport identifier a position identifier and statistical categories enumerated using standard codes provided by the fantasy server application . A given set of standard codes can be accessed using an access token and standardized API as previously described.

In one embodiment for example a sample content file with projections may have the following fields for each projection record as shown in Table 2 as follows 

When a sample content file using the fields as shown in Table 2 is submitted using an HTTP interface the sample content file may be formatted using a CSV format. An sample CSV file is shown as follows 

In one embodiment for example a sample content file with rankings may have the following fields for each ranking record as shown in Table 3 as follows 

When a sample content file using the fields as shown in Table 3 is submitted using an HTTP interface the sample content file may be formatted using a XML format. A sample XML file is shown as follows 

Once the parser component parses received content files the parser component may store the parsed content files as hosted content in a hosted content database managed by the database server . To separate different content files from other hosted content the hosted content may be stored in different hosted content containers . For instance the hosted content from external content database may be stored in a hosted content container while hosted content from external content database may be stored in a hosted content container . Different permissions and access rights may be assigned to each of the hosted content containers to implement a given level of separation and security. Once content files are stored as hosted content a user may access the hosted content from within the unified fantasy framework such as via a dynamic resource document served by the fantasy server application as implemented by the fantasy web server .

As shown in the resource manager component may receive a message request from a web browser of a user device to access hosted content of the hosted content database implemented by the database server . The policy enforcer module may receive the message request retrieve information e.g. an access token subscription information etc. from the message request and determine whether a user of the web browser has access to the requested hosted content . If the user is denied access the policy enforcer module may send a message response with an error message to the web browser . If the user is granted access the policy enforcer module may pass the message request to a hosted resource access module .

The resource manager component may comprise a hosted resource access module arranged to access hosted content from a hosted content database . The hosted resource access module may comprise one or more standardized APIs to access the hosted content database such as a hosted read resource and a hosted write resource . The hosted resource access module the hosted read resource and the hosted write resource may operate similar to the fantasy resource access module the fantasy read resource and the fantasy write resource respectively as described with reference to . In some cases the hosted write resource may be enabled or disabled for certain hosted content based on write privileges granted or denied respectively by a web content server 

The resource manager component may comprise a hosted resource access module arranged to access hosted content from a hosted content database from a hosted content container . The hosted resource access module may retrieve information from a message request identifying a hosted content and or a hosted content container 

The web browser may generate a message request in response to activation of one or more external content controls provided by a dynamic resource document such as the external content controls . In some cases the external content controls may be in a special segment type of the dynamic resource document . In such cases when a user activates an external content control a message request is generated and sent directly to the fantasy web server .

In some cases the external content controls may be provided in a host resource document or a guest resource document . When a user activates an external content control a message request is generated and sent indirectly to the fantasy web server through a host server program or a guest server program . In such cases the hosted resource access module may access hosted content from a hosted content database from a hosted content container in response to a message request from a host server program or a guest server program 

As with the fantasy resource access module the hosted resource access module may retrieve REST information from a message request . The REST information may comprise information needed by the policy enforcer module and or the hosted resource access module in a REST format e.g. stateless format . The hosted resource access module may comprise a hosted read resource . The host read resource may read hosted content from the hosted content database using the REST information. The hosted resource access module may comprise a hosted write resource . The hosted write resource may write hosted content to the hosted content database using the REST information.
