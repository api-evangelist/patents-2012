The subject technology relates generally to assessing the reliability of online vendors. Assessment of online vendors with regard to their reliability is difficult and a constant challenge for both consumers and the various meta shopping services that are associated with these vendors. Novice computer users often require assistance in determining whether an online vendor is untrustworthy.

The subject technology provides a system and computer implemented method for determining a reliability of an online vendor. According to one aspect a computer implemented method may include analyzing one or more groups of emails designated as undesirable to determine a prevalence of one or more known vendors determining one or more reliability indicators for the one or more known vendors based on the identified prevalence and providing the one or more reliability indicators to an application. Other aspects include corresponding systems apparatus and computer program products for implementation of the computer implemented method.

In another aspect a machine readable may include instructions thereon that when executed perform a method for determining a reliability of an online vendor. In this regard the method may include determining a presence of one or more vendors in a plurality of email messages identified as undesirable for each identified vendor determining a reliability indicator based on a prevalence of a characteristic associated with the identified vendor in the plurality of email messages and providing one or more of the determined reliability indicators to an application. Other aspects include corresponding systems apparatus and computer program products for implementation of the method.

A system may include a processor and a memory. The memory may include server instructions that when executed cause the processor to determine a presence of one or more vendors in a plurality of email messages identified as spam and for each vendor determined to be in the plurality of email messages determine a normalized value representative of a number of times the vendor appeared in the plurality of email messages compared to other vendors and provide a representation of the normalized value as a reliability indicator of the vendor to an application used to assess the quality of the identified retailer.

The previously described aspects and other aspects may provide one or more advantages including but not limited to providing an efficient and streamlined method for determining the reliability of one or more vendors that may easily be integrated into an email system to be used on the fly or as part of a nightly batch program and providing consumers and consumer facing applications simple indicators that may be used in assessing whether online vendors are trustworthy.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

The subject technology provides a computer enabled system and method for determining a reliability of an online vendor. According to one aspect one signal for estimating the reliability of a vendor for example an online retailer may be based on the amount of spam email received from the vendor. In this regard the subject technology may include one or more servers may integrated with one or more email accounts to search for and analyze email messages identified by the email accounts as spam. Once spam messages are identified each spam message may be examined to determine the presence of one or more vendors within the spam message. Generally the greater the presence of the vendor in the identified spam messages the less reliable that online vendor may be deemed to be.

Mail server may include for example a mail server application for sending and receiving email to and from other mail servers or applications. Mail server application may for example include a mail transport agent MTA and a mail delivery agent MDA and or other components for facilitating the sending or receiving of email. The MTA may manage the process of transferring mail between computers for example between mail server and a remote mail server and the MDA may be responsible for delivery of email to individual user mailboxes . User mailboxes may be implemented as a local file system on a hard disk a database or other memory device configured for storing incoming and outgoing mail messages. User mailboxes may be implemented on the same physical computing device as mail server located on a different computing device or distributed among a group of computing devices. Mail server application may provide user access to mail stored in one or more of user mailboxes through a client computing device for example a personal computer tablet computer PDA smart phone a television or other display device with one or more computing devices embedded therein or attached thereto or the like using a remote mail access protocol for example Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP or Post Office Protocol POP3 .

Client device may include an email client application including for example a mail user agent for handling tasks related to the creation and addressing of outgoing mail messages and retrieving incoming mail messages from user mailboxes on mail server . In one aspect email client application may include a desktop email application located on client device and configured to communicatively connect to mail server over a network for example the Internet an internet or other network . In another aspect email client application may include a webmail client an email client implemented as a web application and accessed through a web browser. In this regard client device may be a web server and email client application may be accessed by one or more remote client machines operably connected to client device for example over network .

Application server may also be communicatively connected to mail server over network . In this regard application server may include a reliability application configured to be on operable communication with mail server application and or one or more user mailboxes . For example mail server application may be integrated with an application programming interface API configured to accept communication requests from reliability application to analyze for example scan mail server application and retrieve email information from user mailboxes . As will be described in further detail reliability application may be configured to access one or more user mailboxes to identify a group of undesirable email messages and determine the presence of one or more vendors within the identified group of undesirable email messages. For each identified vendor reliability application may determine a reliability indicator for example a numeric value representative of how undesirable emails the vendor has sent to the one or more user mailboxes or to an aggregated group of user mailboxes analyzed over a period of time. Reliability application may provide the reliability indicator to a remote application for example a consumer application or website operating for example on a remote web server . Remote application and users who access or use remote application may use the reliability indicator to assess the quality of the identified vendor.

An email group may include one or more emails identified by the corresponding email system as having undesirable content. First process may analyze email group from one email account or may analyze an aggregate of multiple groups from multiple respective email accounts. Additionally or in the alternative an email group of undesirable emails may include emails identified as undesirable by a user or labeled or placed in a folder identified for example flagged as being associated with undesirable emails. On detecting the presence of a known vendor in an identified email message first process may associate the identified email message with the known vendor.

Determining the presence of a known vendor may include analyzing a group of email messages to determine whether one or more of email messages include one or more characteristics associated with the vendor. In this regard first process for example in a first subprocess may analyze each email message and determine whether the email contains one or a plurality of stored vendor characteristics. Vendor characteristics may have been stored for example in storage location indexed by vendors by a previous process. On detecting a vendor characteristic the email may be associated with the vendor associated with the characteristic. Vendor characteristics may include attributes for example at least a portion of an electronic address URL domain name or a partial domain name or the like one or more terms for example a name or partial name of a vendor an image or the like associated with one or more known vendors or that are known to exist in emails or websites associated with the one or more known vendors. In another example email messages may be analyzed for other information for example uncommon or unique terms or collections or patterns of terms that are known to exist in emails and or websites associated with the known vendors. Email messages may also be searched for attributes for example a URL corresponding to an image known to exist on a website of a known vendor for example a logo or for an image corresponding to an attribute for example a URL of the vendor.

In another aspect first process for example in a second subprocess may identify one or more links for example hyperlinks embedded within content of an analyzed email message for example in the displayed text or HTML code and then attempt to navigate the one or more links to determine one or more online resources including for example a website webpage video or audio file document or the like corresponding to the one or more links. Once the resource is identified the characteristics of the resource for example terms or patterns of terms users graphics or the like may be analyzed using the previously described techniques to determine the known vendors associated with the resource.

First process may generate a list of known vendors whose presence has been detected and store the identified vendors in a second storage location . Additionally or in the alternative the identified vendors may be stored in one or more different database tables of first storage location or set a flag associated with the detected vendors in first storage location or the like. Moreover the functionality of first storage location and second storage location may be implemented in the same storage or distributed across a plurality of storages. The storages may take any form such as relational databases object oriented databases file structures text based records or other forms of data repositories.

In some aspects a reliability process may determine a prevalence of the one or more known vendors determined to be present in the analyzed email messages . For each known online vendor reliability generator for example a software process executed by the one or more servers may determine a count of how many times the vendor appeared in a group of email messages including for example in any linked resources. The prevalence of the one or more characteristics may for example be a numeric value determined from a number of times the characteristic appears in the one or more groups of emails or in some aspects a number of emails messages for example in one or more groups of emails that include the characteristic or the like. The value may be normalized with regard to how many times other vendors appear in the analyzed messages an aggregate set of messages or sample set of messages and converted to a reliability value for example a numerical or letter based score . Reliability process may then provide the reliability value to an application. For example the reliability value may be provided through for example an interface for example through a web service a query of storage location or the like to a website web application or one or more meta shopping services operating for example on remote web server of .

The functionality of reliability process and first process may be implemented in the same process or distributed across a plurality of separate processes. Similarly reliability process may be implemented on the same physical computing device as first process located on a different computing device or distributed among a group of computing devices.

In step one or more reliability indicators are determined for the one or more known vendors based on the identified prevalence. In this regard a reliability indicator may be determined for each identified vendor or for a group of vendors. A reliability indicator may be a numeric representation of the previously described count a normalized value thereof or another representation of the prevalence of the corresponding vendor or the like. In step the one or more reliability indicators are provided to an application for example a remote application .
