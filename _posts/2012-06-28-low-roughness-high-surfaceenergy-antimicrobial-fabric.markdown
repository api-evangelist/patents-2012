title: Low roughness high surface-energy, anti-microbial fabric
abstract: A self-decontaminating fabric is manufactured from fibers such as Tencel having high surface energy and low surface roughness. Novel scouring methods eliminate substantially all contaminants from the fibers, and a novel coating process applies an anti-pathogen coating such as a halogen compound to the fabric so as to provide rapid deactivation of pathogens on contact. Novel charging methods activate or reactivate the coating, typically by exposure to chlorine. The coating is substantially free of gap regions where pathogens can survive. The high surface energy of the fibers allows a high coating concentration and provides close contact between attached pathogens and the coating. The low surface roughness reduces the pickup of pathogens by the fibers. Multi-layer embodiments include an outer layer configured for maximum anti-pathogen coating concentration, and an inner layer configured for a reduced coating concentration that is compatible with skin contact.

All of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

Portions of the present invention may have been made in conjunction with Government funding under NSF Grant No. IIP 1047008 and there may be certain rights to the Government.

The invention relates to protective fabrics and more particularly to fabrics which are able to neutralize pathogens on contact.

Drug resistant pathogens represent a significant public health problem which can affect individuals at work at home and even in the hospital. After 60 years of sometimes indiscriminant antibiotic use Methicillin Resistant MRSA Vancomycin Resistant VRSA and other gram negative pathogens are currently circumventing our traditional approaches to pathogen control and challenging our capacity to innovate new technical solutions.

In Feb. 10 2010 Reuters reported that the estimated cost of infections acquired at hospitals alone is 8.1 billion. From a study published in that same day Reuters reported finds by researchers that pneumonia patients stayed an extra 14 days after surgery and that more than 11 percent of them died. That s the tragedy of such cases said Anup Malani of the University of Chicago who worked on the study. In some cases relatively healthy people check into the hospital for routine surgery. They develop sepsis because of a lapse in infection control and they can die. The researchers said that 1.7 million healthcare associated infections are diagnosed every year. Many are due to drug resistant bacteria such as Methicillin Resistant or MRSA which cost more to treat because only a few drugs can work against them. These infections can also be caught outside hospitals and some studies show that such community acquired infections are also on the rise. One estimate from Pfizer Inc. suggested that treating MRSA alone costs 4 billion a year.

As human density and high speed transport of people and food products has become the norm newly evolved pathogen types can be spread widely and result in major public health issues. One of the ways that drug resistant pathogens can be spread is by cross contamination also referred to herein as contact transfer whereby the pathogens contaminate the skin and or clothing of an individual and then are transferred from one individual to another through personal contact. The risk of cross contamination is especially great in public and institutional settings where workers interact with the general public. Examples include hospital emergency departments hospital infectious disease care units general hospital environments long term healthcare facilities correctional facilities transportation screening such as TSA transport screening some athletic facilities law enforcement corrections toll booth attendants theater ticket takers and EMT and fire services. Many of these facilities have already suffered serious outbreaks of infection and know from experience that these pathogens can be difficult to control.

Attempts to avoid cross contamination typically include a complete range of hand hygiene protocols including hand washing and or gelling and use of barrier gloves and or other personal protection equipment PPE . Personal protection equipment PPE such as masks and gloves gowns and other protective clothing that can be changed and laundered frequently is often used to protect an individual from exposure to dangerous pathogens for example in a medical environment or when investigating a toxic biological spill. Other examples include police prison guards custodial personnel security personnel at airports and other secure installations toll collectors on roadways and ticket takers at theaters.

In particular protective disposable gloves are often worn under such conditions. In these approaches workers must be trained to be diligent in using the gloves and other protective clothing and to change them frequently. It is well understood that the key to control of contact transfer is active compliance with these protocols.

However these hygiene protocols can lead to considerable cost and waste as well as loss of valuable time as the user is forced to repeatedly stop whatever he or she is doing so as to sterilize or exchange gloves and or other PPE. In practice a user may be tempted to minimize compliance with required glove sterilizing and or glove changing procedures or may occasionally forget to sterilize or change gloves for example due to being absorbed in performing other duties. Unfortunately in healthcare settings management has already learned that procedural controls are not enough. People make too many small procedural errors to rely on this approach exclusively. And in many settings such as toll and ticket takers frequent changing of gloves is simply not practical.

In addition frequent changing of protective gloves can cause contamination of the user due to handling of used contaminated gloves. If the user fails to properly sterilize his or her hands after removal of contaminated gloves the user can become infected. Since hand sterilization is typically carried out using an alcohol based substance protection from such sterilization does not persist from one glove change to the next so that even a single failure to properly sterilize hands during a change of gloves can lead to dangerous results.

Also because non disposable gloves are typically sterilized by applying an alcohol based product to the outer surfaces of the gloves and because these sterilizing products evaporate quickly this approach to glove sterilization does not provide any protection against cross contamination between sterilizations.

One approach is to sterilize the user s hands between glove changes with a persistent sterilizing cream such as a hand cream containing Triclosan which can provide some back up protection in case the user s hands are not properly sterilized during a subsequent glove change. However such a cream may interfere with use of the gloves. Also abrasion by the glove itself can tend to wear the cream away. In addition this approach provides no added protection against cross contamination of others if the gloves are not sterilized and or changed with sufficient frequency.

Efforts to avoid cross contamination could be much more successful if workers could wear gloves gowns and or other protective garments which were self decontaminating and therefore did not need to be changed as often as standard protective garments and or could continue to provide protection against cross contamination even if a busy doctor or nurse for example occasionally forgot to change his or her gloves between patients. Many personnel from hospitals transport security police corrections and other public services typically move from one subject to the next within 30 180 seconds. Therefore for a self decontaminating fabric to be effective it must be able to destroy a wide range of pathogens on its outer surface to a 3 log kill level within 30 180 seconds.

A number of self decontaminating fabrics are currently on the market utilizing copper silver or hydantoin attached chloramine. However for these fabrics the 3 log kill rates for vegetative pathogens are in the range of 1 24 hours and many if not most of these current offerings have little or no affect on endospores such as . Therefore while these fabrics may be useful for other purposes they are not effective for cross contamination control.

A number of other self decontaminating fabric technologies have been under development for many years and some of them have been commercialized including silver coatings and other metal compounds phenols chitosan and PHMB to name a few. However none of these fabrics can provide a sufficiently fast kill time all have declining performance after washing and use and none are rechargeable.

Note that the teachings herein are applicable to a variety of types of PPE equipment such as masks and even complete protection suits and that the term glove is used generically herein to refer to all such PPE equipment except where the context specifically requires a hand worn glove.

What is needed therefore is a self decontaminating fabric from which protective gloves and other garments can be made whereby the fabric provides persistent protection against cross contamination and user contamination preferably having a 3 log pathogen kill rate of between 30 and 180 seconds and whereby the fabric is easily recharged for continued long term use.

A self decontaminating fabric is manufactured from fibers having high surface energy and low surface roughness. Substantially all contaminants are eliminated from the fibers after which an anti pathogen coating is attached through non covalent hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals forces so as to provide rapid deactivation of pathogens on contact. The low surface roughness reduces the tendency of pathogens to attach to the fibers. The high surface energy enables coating of the anti pathogen compound at a high concentration and also causes any attached pathogens to be held in close contact with the anti pathogen compound for rapid deactivation of the pathogens even in the absence of moisture. The elimination of substantially all contaminants from the fibers provides for an anti pathogen coating having substantially no gaps. Failure to eliminate such gaps would significantly undermine the protection provided by the fabric against cross contamination.

There is of course a wide range of fibers formed from a large number of organic materials to which anti pathogen coatings can be applied. The concentration of a coating to a fiber based material depends in large measure on the interfacial surface tension of the filament coating pair. If the thermodynamics of this interface is not favorable wetting of the coating will be inhibited preventing the intimate contact needed for hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals attachment. As a result with incomplete wetting the antimicrobial surface will be incomplete or variable in density.

In addition to the necessity to manage the filament coating interface the interactions between biological pathogens and the coating surface are critical to the effectiveness of the antimicrobial system. In the absence of liquid water the antimicrobial action requires intimate contact between the pathogen cell membrane and the active surface. In general the more infectious pathogens have superior attachment behavior to skin and mucus membranes.

In embodiments the substrate of the present invention has a surface energy measured by the Washburn method before coating of about approximately 68 mJ mand a surface energy after coating and charging as measured by the Washburn method of at least 60 mJ m.

Current anti microbial systems are not able to achieve fast inactivation times for bio pathogens. A critical need in the management of contact transfer is short inactivation times. The current systems have not been able to achieve short inactivation times because the importance of defects in the coatings was not understood. The insight which contributed to the present invention is as follows when there are gaps or windows in the coverage of the biocide coating the antimicrobial activity can be improved on average however the effective speed of the anti pathogen is not improved. At the small scale of bacteria coating defects have a binary effect. Bacteria on active coating regions are inactivated however even a very high average coating anti microbial activity does not inactivate bacteria which are located in a widow or gap in the antimicrobial coating on the substrate.

It is true that many anti pathogens i.e. antimicrobials have an inhibition zone AATCC M147 . However this effect is only seen over long exposure times. For this reason current antimicrobials have very effective inactivation rates for multi hour exposure times. However there is little further improvement in the speed of inactivation if the system relies on both direct contact and inhibition zone effects. Because all current anti microbial coating methods result in a significant density of coating flaws their inactivation speeds are limited.

In contrast having understood the criticality of a full coverage antimicrobial system without gaps or windows the present invention is able to deliver inactivation times that are a small fraction of the current state of the art providing a high speed kill system. Furthermore as a result of this insight into the problem the inventor was able to realize the benefit of further improvements related to increased surface energy. Because the present invention is based on direct contact between the pathogen and the anti pathogen the surface energy can be used to improve the wetting at this interface. Because there is uninterrupted antimicrobial activity on the surface of the fabric the improvement in wetting and increased contact area provided by the high surface area results in a substantial improvement of the inactivation speed. However if there were coating defects a high surface energy and improved pathogen attachment would only result in increased transfer of those pathogens which were attached to the gap regions. Therefore the realization by the inventor that coating flaws were the source of a problem was an important component to enabling the present invention.

This coating flaw insight also enabled the further improvement which is associated with using fibers that have smooth surfaces. Once the forgoing speed improvements were achieved with cotton and other rough fiber types the inventor was able to discriminate the effect of surface morphology on pathogen surface loading. Once the fabric is delivering direct contact inactivation surface morphology can control the pathogen loading. Pathogen transfer rates to the antimicrobial compound are controlled by surface geometry. Lower pathogen transfer improves the inactivation rate.

Contaminates on the surface of fibers prevent the wetting and subsequent adhesion of antimicrobial coatings to the fiber. Therefore to permit the attachment of coatings of the fiber the wax size lubricants used in processing the fiber and other contaminates are minimized. There are many continuous desizing processes. In general they consist of multiple dip and pad passes through aqueous baths containing detergent and wetting components. The dip and pad of desizing chemistry in embodiments applied at low or zero tension is followed with multiple rinse and pad steps to remove the contaminants solvated by the desizing chemistry. Typically the level of residual contaminates is less than 1 by weight of the textile.

The process engineering for coating fibers and fibrous webs has developed into a large number of distinct subject areas. These include a range of methods including open width roll to roll methods padding blade coating direct and reverse roll coating slot die direct extrusion and vapor deposit. Roll to roll techniques are not all open width and include rope coating and jet coating among others. These continuous process types have a range of features that include limited tension in the cross machine direction and some constructive manipulation of the fiber bundles. However the need to transport the web through the process limits the opportunity of these processes to apply compressive mechanical action to the yarn bundles.

Continuing this theme there is a set of non continuous dying processes which have been developed for yarn hanks packages or garments. These batch processes are variable in their process specifics. However they include some methods that permit constructive mechanical action of the fiber bundles under zero tension during the dying process. Drum and paddle garment piece dying is unique in this group in permitting both zero tension and compressive mechanical action to the yarn bundles. These batch processes are not used with organic solvent based baths but are more than 95 aqueous based.

The features and advantages described herein are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.

The present invention in embodiments is an antimicrobial coated fabric structure which uses both interface control mechanisms and anti pathogen inactivation of the bio pathogen to control cross contamination also referred to herein as contact transfer. The invention controls surface energy vectors of the coated fabric surface to enhance hydrogen bonding and or Van der Waals attachment of the pathogen. In addition the total pickup rate of pathogens is controlled by controlling the surface roughness of the substrate.

The operating mechanism of the present invention is as follows. The smoothness of the fiber surfaces limits the pickup of pathogens. The high surface energy of the fibers ensures that pathogens which are picked up will be well attached and will be less likely to be sloughed off and therefore less likely to result in contact transmission. The high surface energy of the fibers also ensures that attached pathogens will have increased contact area with the biocide and will therefore be more likely to be inactivated at high rates.

The present invention is based on a combination of novel elements including selection of fibers having high surface area and high smoothness a novel scour process for the preparation of the fabric surface which in embodiments is a chemically clean OH functionalized cellulosic surface and a novel coating process that achieves a very complete coverage of the filament surface high pick up and complete penetration of the fiber bundle providing durable attachment through non covalent hydrogen bonding and or Van der Waals forces. This coating provides for consistent coverage of anti pathogen which in embodiments is a halogen based biocide on the substrate surface such as halamine or a halogen charged version of an N cyclic hydantoin or DMDMH.

The consistent coverage without gaps or windows is critical because of the scale of bio pathogens as can be seen in . The reference bacteria in the figures are on the order of 0.5 micron in diameter and the defects in the coating must be rare on this scale.

As can be seen in the typical central crease in the cotton filament must be coated since it is of the appropriate scale to permit bacterial transfer if the biocide is not continuous over these areas.

In various embodiments the anti pathogen coating can include any of a number of compounds. In some embodiments the anti pathogen coating includes a halogen based biocide which can be a halogenated N cyclic such as hydantoin or DMDMH with a halogen charge halogen charged glycoluril quaternary ammonium salts and or other compounds.

Using the contact transfer test protocol CTTP we have been able to demonstrate novel anti pathogen transfer control performance whereby the biocide is capable of inactivating between 97 and 99.9999 of the bio pathogen in 90 seconds.

The selection and processing of the fiber type is important to the control of the surface energy of the structure. Embodiments of the present invention make use of cellulosic fibers for highly antimicrobial surfaces. These fibers are polar and have hydroxylated surfaces which are generally high in energy. The higher the surface energy of the fiber surface the more it improves the attachment of the biological surface of the pathogens. In addition the higher energy more polar fibers have superior attachment for the anti microbial coatings because the high energy and polarity of the surface provides strong attachment of the biocidal layer by Van der Waals attachment and the hydroxy sites on the surfaces are ideal for hydrogen bonding of biocides such as halogenated anti microbials including halamine halogenated N cyclics halogenated hydantoin and halogenated DMDMH.

With reference to in embodiments the invention makes use of sythentic cellulosics because they have higher surface energy than natural cellulosics such as the pima cotton fiber shown at 5000 magnification in . With reference to also shown at 5000 magnification Tencel a rayon like cellulosic produced by Lensing has a clean surface energy of greater than 60 mJ mconsiderably higher than pima cotton. Some fibers listed in a representative ascending order of surface energy are Polyester Nylon Cotton Nitro cellulose viscose and Lyocell Tencel .

In embodiments the substrate has a surface energy measured by the Washburn method before coating of about approximately 68 mJ mand a surface energy after coating and charging as measured by the Washburn method of at least 60 mJ m.

The use of lyocell type reconstituted cellulose fiber offers two benefits. First the Tencel type has a smooth round cross section with a Sa of less than 0.02 microns which is much smoother than a typical pima cotton with a Sa roughness greater than 0.09 microns. Second Lyocell has significantly higher surface energy as compared with cotton. This surface energy benefit is sustained after charge with chlorine and represents an approximately 50 increase over natural cotton. Based on general experience with wetting and the range of possible surface energy levels the Lyocell type surface will generate significantly better wetting to the pathogen than either cotton or nylon materials.

In embodiments the structure described above is combined with at least one additional textile element of a different type than the clean OH functionalized celulosic surface. This element has controlled coating attachment and therefore a controlled charge. This is discussed in more detail below in reference to multi layer fabric embodiments.

In addition to surface energy the surface morphology of the substrate is significant to the invention. illustrates the family of cellulosic fiber types including cotton Tencel Modal and Viscose . These micrographs by Lenzing show the cross sections of the important types of natural and reconstituted fibers. These images also suggest the surface morphology and surface roughness of these fibers.

The invention makes use of novel competing interfacial effects provided by smooth synthetic cellulosic filaments. It has been shown in dental studies that the level of roughness is a significant factor in bacterial attachment see The influence of surface free energy and surface roughness on early plaque formation By Quirynen M. Marechal M. Busscher H. J. J. Clin Periodontol 17 138 44 1990 . It has been demonstrated that the low roughness of these very smooth filaments limits the pickup of bio pathogens in contact transfer. Lower loading of bio pathogens reduces the quantity of CFUs that must be inactivated. The high energy of the surface is less significant in the pickup of bio pathogens when compared to the roughness of the filament.

Some transfer pickup of pathogens results even on smooth filaments. As a result of the high surface energy of the filament surface these bio pathogens wet to the surface and are in intimate contact with the antimicrobial coatings. This sequence is as follows 

With reference to in embodiments single yarn bundles of less than 1000 d denier are used. In some embodiments single yarn bundles less 300 d are used and in certain embodiments singles yarns of less than 200 d denier are used. In some embodiments the yarn bundle has a twist multiple of below 3.9 and in other embodiments the yarn bundle has a twist multiple of below 3.5 depending on the tensile requirements of the textile. In certain embodiments the filament percentage in the outer surface of the yarn bundle is above 20 .

In the present invention to optimize scour antimicrobial coating and charging the textile substrate is of an open structure. Embodiments include substrate constructions of greater than 30 yarns inch in the machine direction and greater than 30 yarns per inch in the cross machine direction. The preferred textile has an Air Permeability tested by ASTM D737 of greater than 400 cfm ft.

In various embodiments this is achieved using wovens knits or non woven substrates. In addition in some embodiments a second fiber can be used to create a substrate with differential antimicrobial and comfort features. This is discussed in more detail below with reference to multi layer fabric embodiments.

The near complete elimination of surface contaminates is central to the present invention. Coatings are applied in embodiments of the present invention which have a thickness of less than 1.0 microns with little or no bridging to adjacent filaments. The fiber film or substrate must be free of contaminates and wax or a cleaning or scouring process must be used to remove any contamination prior to the coating process. For high performance anti pathogens the coating must be substantialy continous and consistent over the filaments in the yarn bundle or other substrate surface. The present invention provides an absence of coating defects which might otherwise result from a range of effects such as the use of high surfactant emulsion loading. This absence of coating defects in the present invention results in part from avoiding the following sources of defects 

Surface defects in the coating resulting from any of the sources listed above have two effects. First they reduce the average antimicrobial coverage and second they create zones of distance between attached pathogens and antimicrobial material. The very tight control of the coating process in the present invention results in very fast inactivation times for pathogens because the present invention provides a very high degree of biocide coating film integrity.

In the case of a typical cotton fiber the cotton wax and pectin components in the cell structure are low energy components which limit the performance of the cotton with regard to coating compatibility and bio attachment of pathogens. Even with complex enzymatic scour processes these lower energy components of the cotton cannot be eliminated. Fully reconstituted forms of cellulose do not have these surface components. Reconstituted cellulosic fibers require a spin finish for processing in common with other fibers. These lubricants and antistatic finishes can be effectively scoured off the fabric if considerable care is taken with the chemistry of the scour process.

Scour finishes removal step with liquor ratio between 2 1 and 5 1 liquor to wet goods operated at temperature 25 60 C. at a pH of 7 11 and a combination of anionic surfactants and detergents resulting surface energy for cotton less than 40 mJ mcalculated using the Washburn method.

Agitation is used for 40 min with zero tension and using a piece or garment process permitting both cross machine and machine direction compression of the fiber bundles. Water used is demineralized. Rinse is 3 steps at 60 C. and has a liquor ratio of 5 1 liquor to wet goods . Extraction is done at 300 g s leaving a methanol extractable limit of less than 0.3 by weight using ASTM D2257 2004 Soxhlet extraction.

The anti pathogen coating process in embodiments of the present invention includes novel features in both the coating formulation and the coating application. In general organic solvent based coatings have been restricted in use as a result of the environmental controls that are required. The widely used alternative to organic solvents is the use of aqueous emulsions based on surfactants. This surfactant emulsion approach is the typical method used for antimicrobial coating formulations. However this approach is not used in the creation of the high surface energy anti pathogen coatings of the present invention. If a surfactant were used in the coating it would result in surfactant being trapped in the coated film and would thereby result in reduced coating consistency and lower surface energy.

In addition to novel coating materials a special coating process is included in embodiments of the present invention. In particular embodiments of the present invention avoid the use of continuous coating methods which could cause limitation of the internals of the fiber bundles. Exposure times to the coating bath tension levels and agitation would not be optimized in continuous processing. In embodiments of the present invention special piece or garment coating processes are used. Embodiments include contact times with the coating bath of greater than 10 minutes including continuous agitation with zero tension on the yarn bundles. Various embodiments include jet processing with 50 100 g s of rotational acceleration while coating liquor is being sprayed on the textile surfaces. The various embodiments of the present invention allow for intimate contact between coating and fiber bundles during this extended processing providing high coating durability through non covalent hydrogen bonding and or Van der Waals attachment mechanisms.

In certain embodiments agitation of the charging bath permits diffusion of the halogen into the thickness of the coating including obscured surfaces interior to the filament bundle and provides mechanical manipulation of the un tensioned filament bundle during coating application. This combination produces a more continuous coating throughout the yarn bundle and around each filament.

With reference to the use of Energy Dispersive X ray spectroscopy EDX permits the analysis of the continuity of the surface coating. This is accomplished by analyzing the chlorine content of the substrate surface. The EDX system integrates a small zone on the target. By evaluation of the fiber or substrate surface with an EDX probe the chlorine content by sample can be plotted to provide a measure of coating consistency. In embodiments the coating process of this invention has an EDX determined coating consistency of fewer than 1 coating gap of 1 min extent per 30 m and in some embodiments fewer than 1 coating gap per 150 m which is a much higher consistency than the current state of the art in antimicrobial treatments.

In embodiments the anti pathogen compound is of an active disassociating type. Embodiments use N halamines and some embodiments use N cyclics such as DMDMH and or hydantoins which provide this type of highly active disassociating chemistry. In some embodiments the CMDH and or DMDMH imide system is used. It has been shown that the antimicrobial effectivenesses of N halamines are in the following order imide amide amine halamines which is in a reverse order of the bound halogen stability. See 

In embodiments the anti pathogen coating is a halogen coating which is charged with aqueous halogen to an exceptional level of halogen charge of 4000 ppm or greater. The use of DMDMH and or hydantoin and or glycoluril in some embodiments permits binding of halogen to these N cyclic chemistries.

The basic method of charging and recharging of the anti pathogen coating in embodiments of the present invention uses an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite Clorox with 200 ppm of titratable chlorine at ambient temperature and with the fabric being maintained under low tension and under continuous agitation for 10 60 minutes of contact time followed by extraction of the excess solution and rinsing and drying of the fabric.

In some embodiments a 400 ppm aqueous solution of chlorine is prepared from gaseous chlorine and demineralized water. The pH of this solution is adjusted to between 4 and 6 by adding hydrochloric acid. The fabric is then processed according to the method of Example A.

In other embodiments a 400 ppm aqueous solution of bromine is prepared from gaseous chlorine and demineralized water. The pH of this solution is adjusted to between 4 and 6 by adding hydrochloric acid. The fabric is then processed as in Example A.

In still other embodiments a 200 ppm aqueous solution of bromine and 200 ppm of chlorine is prepared from gaseous chlorine and demineralized water. The pH of this solution is adjusted to between 4 and 6 by adding hydrochloric acid. The fabric is then processed as in Example A.

In yet other embodiments the charging process is first applied according to one of the examples given above after the wet fabric is suspended in a suitable enclosure and exposed to chlorine gas for 15 minutes.

In order to get very fast inactivation times for control of contact transfer the outer anti pathogen e.g. halogen charge levels must be very high. Charge levels in embodiments are high enough to provide pathogen inactivation in less than 5 minutes and in some embodiments in less than 2 minutes. At these levels of activity the skin of the wearer can become sensitized.

In embodiments the present invention can provide this level of bio pathogen control without concern about adverse affects on the wearer s skin. These embodiments address this concern by the creation of a fabric having a multi layer structure including an outer fiber layer that is capable of accepting an aggressive anti pathogen coating and producing high pathogen inactivation rates and an inner layer of fiber that contacts the wearer s skin and is configured to accept a lower intensity anti microbial coating which is compatible with skin contact.

There are a number of approaches to the fabrication of a multilayer textile structure. The most widely used relates to weaving patterns that produce two faces of the textile that have warp and fill faces. The twill or sateen is most well known pattern that has this property. In these constructions the floats in the weave allow either the warp or the filling to dominate one side of the fabric. When two different yarn types are used in the warp and fill the effect is to produce a two layer structure.

In the knitting process a less well known method is the use of plating where two yarn types are fed to the knitting needles in such a way as to keep one yarn type on one side of the knit and the other yarn on the opposite side of the fabric.

The use of felts also makes non woven textiles possible with two distinct layers. In this approach two layered webs formed of different fibers are combined by bonding or needling to form a single two layer web.

In some multi layer embodiments the outer and inner layers are not uniform in antimicrobial activity. In embodiments the anti pathogen coating is applied in a saturation mode with the fiber bundles at zero tension and mechanical action which compresses and spreads the filament bundles and the crossing points in the structure. While this coating method applies coating to all the surfaces of the textile in embodiments the textile has a controlled acceptance of the coating. By engineering the fiber types on the two surfaces of the textile the thickness and the coverage of the anti microbial coating is controlled and varied.

The following table provides details applicable to an embodiment wherein the inner layer is textured PET fiber and the outer layer of the structure is a cellulosic fiber such as rayon or Tencel filament fiber.

Control of the coating pickup and limitation of the charge eliminates the issues with charge and skin affects to the wearer. Dermatological studies on animal models have been performed with textiles treated and charged with the DMDMH system with limited titratable chlorine of between 200 ppm and 600 ppm. These studies show that at these lower halogen levels there is no skin irritation.

The article An Overview of Antimicrobial Testing for Textile Applications By H. Wayne Swofford Microban International AATCC Review November December 2010 pp 51 55 the November December 2010 provides a summary of the issues in antimicrobial testing. Following is an excerpt from the article.

 Antimicrobial treatment of textiles provides benefits in odor control and freshness as well as protection against degradation due to bacteria and mold. However differences in test results between laboratories and claims of performance through the use of unspecified and inappropriate test methods continually create confusion in the antimicrobial marketplace. The comparative information available on different antimicrobial technologies is often misleading due to differences in test methodologies inappropriate methodologies sometimes honest confusion in running methods and differing levels of expertise. Just because two laboratories cite AATCC TM100 or JIS L 1902 does not mean that the laboratories are actually running those protocols in exactly the same way. The quality of testing is distressingly poor in blind round robin testing less than half of the laboratories evaluated were capable of running a dependable quantitative test protocol. The only way to be sure of comparisons is by running tests side by side in the same laboratory with the same series of tests. Where differences occur between laboratories only detailed review of the test protocol will enable one to understand results. 

These testing issues are even more acute when poorly defined test methods are used to compare inactivation rates. There is some stabilization of results for longer test exposure times. The test protocol effects in short exposure time testing exaggerate the inter laboratory correlation issues.

The AATCC method 100 and other listed Table 6 are all closely related tests and involve the inoculation of an ATS with a pathogen in a broth or other aqueous carrier. There is an inactivation time typically of 1 hour to 24 hours and then the pathogen is extracted and plated to a Petri dish and the CFU are counted after a growth period. These methods are not suitable for evaluation of rapid inactivation of pathogens in contact transfer situations. In practice the AATCC M100 has repeatability issues for rapid test times at less than 15 minutes.

These methods use a large saturating liquid challenge which is not representative of contact transfer. This very large challenge is motivated by the desire to have a test that is capable of measuring up to 6 log reduction in CFU counts. In the vast majority of actual contact transfer events the challenge is not sufficient to saturate the fiber bundles. Moreover the neutralization and liquid extraction steps in Method 100 do not permit the evaluation of the contact transfer. In these existing methods the pathogen is extracted not transferred. In order to evaluate contact transfer effectively we have accepted that the method will not have an extraction step and as a result the new method will not have greater than 3 log CFU count sensitivity.

In order to measure the interfacial behavior of contact pathogens we have developed a method that compares the pathogen transfer of an animal skin model to the candidate ATS materials. This method is based on the methods and concepts in EN1500 and EN1499 for effectiveness of hand gel and hand washing antimicrobials. These EN methods are skin transfer methods. We have adopted the use of an animal skin model to avoid the complexity of using human subjects.

In the CTTP method we plate out a challenge of 30 41 onto a 100 mm agar dish. This challenge is a broth containing 1.5 10 8 CFUs ml. The challenge volume is established for each organism based on the animal skin transfer baseline. This baseline CFU transfer must stay within countable limits on the transfer plate. The animal skin model is prepared from raw un tanned pig skin with fat and bristle removed. Using a 15 80 mm pig skin samples the skin model is printed into the challenge biofilm with a contact load of 8 g cm. Then using the same contact load the skin model is printed on the transfer agar dish. When testing for MacConkey agar with Sorbitol SMAC is used when testing for Mannitol salt agar MSA is used. The same process is repeated for the antimicrobial treated samples and with witness samples that have no antimicrobial treatment. After 24 hour of incubation at 36 c the CFU counts are used to compare treated sample to untreated sample which provides data on the antimicrobial effect and the comparison of the skin model data to the untreated provides data on the surface energy and morphology effect. The skin model result compared to the treated sample provides data on the combined effect of both surface behavior and antimicrobial processes. In addition to these 3 comparisons the challenge plate is counted to ensure test consistency.

Halogen verification is achieved through the process of Iodometry. An Iodometric titration is run as a means to quantitatively represent the level of titratable chlorine on the surface of the textile. Swatch samples must be cut from the treated textile measuring at least 4 cm 4 cm weighed and then placed into a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 35 ml of 0.05N Sulfuric Acid HSO into the flask with the swatch sample. Then add 0.3 g of Potassium Iodide Powder KI into the flask. Using a magnetic stir bar and stir plate allow samples to mix thoroughly as the solution becomes yellow. Using Sodium Thiosulfate NaSO standardized to a concentration of 0.001N begin slowly allowing a steady drip by burette into the flask. Continue to add the NaSOuntil most of the yellow color has dissipated. Once only a faint yellow coloration remains in the solution add 5 drops of starch to act as an indicator solution should turn blue. Continue to add NaSOuntil blue coloration is no longer detectable. Record the final volume of the titrant and the concentration of Chlorine present can be determined through the equation
