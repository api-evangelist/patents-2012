This invention was made with government support under Contract No. F33657 88 C 0134 awarded by United States Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The described subject matter relates generally to turbine exhaust cases for gas turbine engines and more specifically to exhaust ducts for turbine exhaust cases.

The aft exhaust region of a gas turbine engine like many other areas in the engine power core often experiences high thermal gradients across relatively small distances. High thermal gradients particularly in relatively thin metal components can lead to fatigue cracking or other defects before the desired end of a product life cycle leading to premature replacement or in mission engine malfunction. Cracking can be exacerbated by engine vibration and rapid thermal cycling. Certain high performance turbine engines designed for rapidly changing thermal and operational conditions are thus particularly prone to these and similar defects.

An exhaust duct comprises a shroud body a forward flange assembly an aft flange assembly an intermediate flange assembly and a first plurality of bleed ports. The forward flange assembly extends radially inward from a forward shroud end for securing the forward shroud end downstream of a final turbine stage. The aft flange assembly extends circumferentially around and radially inward from an aft shroud end for securing the aft shroud end to an engine tail cone. The intermediate flange assembly is disposed forward of the aft flange assembly and extends circumferentially around and radially inward from the shroud body for securing the shroud body to an engine bearing housing. The first plurality of bleed ports is disposed around the shroud body forward of a junction with the intermediate flange.

A turbine exhaust case TEC duct assembly comprises a forward TEC duct an aft TEC duct and an engine tail cone. The aft TEC duct includes an aft TEC duct shroud body with an inwardly extending forward flange assembly securing a forward shroud end to the forward TEC duct. An inwardly extending aft flange assembly secures an aft shroud end to the engine tail cone. An inwardly extending intermediate flange assembly is provided for securing the aft TEC duct to an engine bearing housing. The shroud body includes a first plurality of bleed ports disposed forward of a junction of the shroud body and intermediate flange assembly.

Propulsion fan rotor drives air through the bypass duct coaxially oriented between the engine core and nacelle . Fan rotor or other propulsion stage can be directly or indirectly rotationally coupled to low pressure shaft . In advanced designs fan drive gear system couples fan shaft to low spool with respective planetary ring and sun gear mechanisms and providing independent fan speed control for reduced noise and improved operating efficiency. In more conventional turbofan designs fan drive gear system is omitted and fan is driven directly as part of low spool . Fan exit guide vanes FEGVs are disposed between nacelle and the engine core to reduce swirl and improve thrust performance through the bypass duct. High performance embodiments of engine may optionally include a thrust augmenter not shown proximate the exhaust of the power core.

Turbine exhaust case TEC is disposed at an aft end of the power core of engine . Also visible in are certain elements in or adjacent to TEC including TEC struts vanes TEC outer case exhaust tail cone . More details of the area in and around TEC are shown in .

It will be recognized from the remainder of the description that the invention is by no means limited to the example two spool high bypass turbofan engine shown in . By way of further non limiting examples fan rotor may additionally or alternatively include an unducted rotor with turbine engine thereby operating as a turboprop or unducted turbofan engine. Alternatively fan rotor may be absent leaving nacelle covering only the engine core with turbine engine thereby being configured as a turbojet or turboshaft engine.

Generally speaking combustion gases G exiting the final stage of a turbine section e.g. LPT in enter TEC passing around a plurality of circumferentially distributed TEC struts vanes and out over tail cone . Struts extend radially between outer case shown in and inner case . In certain embodiments inner case and or outer case may be integral with or cooperate with aft bearing housing to form part of the engine backbone and support the aft ends of the engine driveshafts e.g. shafts in . In this example configuration the shown TEC strut is airfoil shaped allowing it along with at least some of the other distributed struts vanes to simultaneously serve as a turbine exit guide vane. The airfoil shaped outer surface may be a structural characteristic of strut vane or alternatively strut vane includes one or more radially extending internal structural members clad in a hollow element having an airfoil shaped outer surface.

Aft TEC duct includes a shroud body having an axially aft shroud end and a forward shroud end . In this particular example forward shroud end may include a plurality of circumferentially distributed strut cutouts . Strut cutouts may be circumferentially distributed around forward end for engaging a corresponding plurality of struts vanes . Thus the shape of strut cutout may complement at least an aft portion of strut vane to minimize leakage toward inner case and or bearing housing . Aft TEC duct and forward TEC duct can form a TEC duct assembly defining an inner flow boundary for exhaust gas G. This example combination defines the inner flow boundary of gas G leaving LPT . Forward TEC duct may have corresponding strut cutouts not numbered aligned with strut cutouts in which case the respective pairs of strut cutouts form passages through the boundary for each strut vane . Tail cone can also be secured to aft flange described below to further define the TEC duct assembly and inner flow boundary. The duct assembly may also engage a portion of bearing housing to provide additional stability as noted below.

Aft TEC duct can include forward flange assembly extending radially inward from the forward shroud end . Forward flange assembly can join forward shroud end to a component disposed axially forward of duct and downstream of a final turbine stage. The forwardly adjacent component such as forward TEC duct may also include a corresponding flange not numbered to removably secure the two components together minimizing gaps particularly around strut vane and strut cutout while strengthening the structural connection therebetween. As will be explained below depending on the arrangement of strut cutouts for TEC struts vanes forward flange assembly may be a single flange extending entirely circumferentially around forward shroud end . Forward flange assembly may alternatively be a number of partial circumferentially distributed flange sections to accommodate strut cutouts . In certain embodiments such as those with a single TEC duct forward flange assembly can secure the duct directly adjacent to an outlet of the turbine.

Aft TEC duct can also include aft flange extending circumferentially around and radially inward from aft shroud end . Aft flange can join aft shroud end to an adjacent component axially aft thereof. In this example the axially aft component is engine tail cone . This extends the inner boundary of the exhaust path to the end of the power core.

In certain embodiments aft TEC duct can also include intermediate flange disposed at a midspan region of aft TEC duct . Here intermediate flange includes a first end of obtuse portion extending axially forward and radially inward from aft shroud end . Radial portion extends radially inward from a second opposing end of obtuse portion and may occupy a radial plane substantially parallel to forward and aft flanges . Radial portion of intermediate flange can be configured to mount aft TEC duct to a centrally arranged structure such as bearing housing . The connection may be direct or indirect and may involve connection to TEC inner case .

Riblets can optionally extend axially along the inner gas path boundary along one or both TEC ducts . The circumferentially distributed riblets disposed circumferentially adjacent to one or both sides of strut cutouts can both reinforce ducts as well as improve boundary flow. Aft TEC duct can include additional or alternative features visible in and or B such as bleed ports A B outer stiffening ring and strut cutout stiffeners . Utilizing one or more of these and other features better shown and described in the following figures can reduce the likelihood of premature defects without substantially increasing engine weight.

One aspect of a rapid response TEC duct assembly can include aft TEC duct with intermediate flange . As discussed above certain embodiments of intermediate flange can have obtuse portion and radial portion . Outer end B of obtuse flange portion extends toward inner end A and radial flange portion to form an interior angle with aft shroud end . This angle may be between about 45 and about 75 . In certain embodiments the interior angle is about 60 .

This arrangement controls radial and axial expansion contraction of aft TEC duct relative to surrounding components during periods of rapidly changing operational conditions such as may be seen in military aircraft engines with a thrust augmenter. Controlling this growth reduces exhaust leaks at the various gaps reducing the engine s thermal signature. However in certain of these rapid response embodiments thermal cracking can occur in aft TEC duct caused by excessive thermal gradients across and through the duct. As part of the inner flow path boundary shroud ends are exposed to hot exhaust gas G shown in . Starting the augmenter not shown rapidly increases the temperature of gas G thermally expanding shrouds of the outer TEC duct assembly. Stopping the augmenter quickly decreases these temperatures Thus during the times immediately after starting or stopping the augmenter the temperature inside the ducts has not caught up to the outer surface temperature. Bulging and contraction of aft TEC duct can result due to thermal cycling fatigue cracking.

Cracking is most prone to occur axially aft of strut cutouts near the junction of aft shroud end and intermediate flange . To reduce gradients between outer and inner regions aft TEC duct can therefore include one or more bleed ports A B. A first plurality of bleed ports A can be circumferentially distributed equally around aft shroud end proximate midspan of the duct. In the example of port A is disposed axially aft of strut cutout . In the event strut also serves as a guide vane ports A may be circumferentially aligned relative to strut cutouts . In one example port A is circumferentially aligned with the apex of strut cutout . An additional plurality of bleed ports B can be optionally provided and disposed circumferentially intermediate adjacent ones of the first plurality of bleed ports A. Ports A B may be axially disposed immediately forward of the junction of intermediate flange and aft shroud end .

Ports A B can include at least one hole for providing turbine exhaust air radially inward from aft TEC duct equalizing temperatures adjacent bearing housing and or inner TEC case shown in . The hole can be directed generally between inner and outer regions of TEC and more directly to impinge flowing exhaust gas G onto one or more flanges such as intermediate flange obtuse portion . This reduces thermal differentials between intermediate flange and aft shroud end which lowers the magnitude and frequency of thermal cycling and the resultant incidence of low cycle fatigue. Further bleed ports A B may be provided elsewhere on aft TEC duct as needed to further reduce thermal cycling fatigue.

Optionally aft TEC duct can also include reinforcing structures or elements on one or both of aft shroud end and forward shroud end . In it can be seen that flange connector joins aft flange with outer end B of obtuse flange portion reinforcing aft shroud end . An outer stiffening ring can also be secured aft of ports A B allowing use of a thinner duct wall for aft shroud end . Stiffening ribs can reinforce perimeters of respective strut cutouts A enabling thinner walls for forward shroud end .

In the examples shown forward flange assembly is made up of a plurality of circumferentially distributed forward flange segments for connection downstream of the final turbine stage e.g. connection to forward TEC duct . As noted above forward flange assembly may alternatively be a monolithic flange.

While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment s it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
