In order to fulfill the need for a more eco friendly cleaning and restorative solution for outdoor structures which contain PVC the present invention has been created. The invention utilizes plant based solvents to modify the PVC surface giving the appearance of color restoration. In addition the invention utilizes UV absorbers and HALS hindered amine light stabilizers to extend the color retention of the surface. The UV absorbers prevent the degradation of both coatings and substrates by filtering out harmful UV energy of sunlight. The HALS stabilizers act as radical scavengers and inhibit the photo oxidative breakdown reactions. Both of these effective ingredients work together synergistically to provide enhanced protection and prolonged coating durability. In addition to the invention s utility as a restorative and rejuvenating composition it also displays cleaning properties and can be used to remove scuff marks rust oil stains and other stains on the above mentioned polymeric surfaces.

In this respect before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.

As such those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception upon which this disclosure is based may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important therefore that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

As required detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein however it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale some features may be exaggerated to show details of particular components. Therefore specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.

In one embodiment of the invention a liquid composition utilizes ethyl lactate as its primary active ingredient. It may also use up to 9 10 of a traditional hydrocarbon solvent. Ethyl lactate is the primary active ingredient for the cleaning properties of the invention which also utilizes d limonene as a lesser active ingredient to aid its cleaning properties. In one embodiment the formulation of the invention comprises a concentration of 94 5 by volume of a material sold under the name of Bio Solv sold by MAS Epoxies located at 2615 River Road Cinnaminson N.J. This product contains 91 ethyl lactate and a solvent containing ethyl 3 at 8 and BHT at 1 concentration. In addition to the Bio Solv ingredient d limonene in the amount of 6 is included. An enhanced version of the invention utilizes an organic UV inhibitor in the range of 0.25 to 5 . An example is Tinuvine 5151 produced by CIBA Specialty Chemicals at a concentration of 1.66 with the other ingredients reduced proportionately. Other ingredients that have been tested include soy methyl ester as well as other plant based solvents. The inclusion of a UV inhibitor blocker with a PVC restorative solvent is thought to be a unique aspect of the invention. The UV inhibitors combine with the dissolved PVC surface to retain the inhibitor within the dissolved host material. This chemical action has been found to greatly extend the UV inhibiting life of the treatment compared to prior art products.

The composition of the invention is used to clean and restore color to weathered or aged surfaces primarily PVC cap stock acrylic cap stock ASA cap stock fiberglass and other polymeric surfaces. These surfaces typically include household materials such as decks siding deck railing piping and marine surfaces. The invention has been found effective in restoring the color and removing stains from these plastic surfaces. The liquid composition of the invention is employed very simply by direct topical application using a 100 cotton cloth or mop. It can also be sprayed on with spray apparatus well known in the art. The invention provides a one step cleaning and conditioning of surfaces and materials containing PVC while restoring and beatifying their original color. The present invention works by a chemical re extrusion of the PVC surface by melting microcrazing cracks together. This process changes the way light is reflected and refracted from the surface giving the appearance of restoring the original color. The bio based solvents soften the PVC surface and allow the UV inhibitor blocker to chemically bond to the PVC therefore extending the life of the color of the PVC. In one embodiment the hydrocarbon solvent is butylated toluene.

The present invention as demonstrated by the composition of one embodiment described above and has been found to extend the life of the PVC surface color providing a cleaning and restorative result in a one step simple application. The inventive composition provides advantages over the prior art because it utilizes plant based non hazardous non flammable constituents. It is shown to be highly effective in restoring color to faded aged or weathered surfaces while cleaning stains. Incorporation of the UV absorbers and HALS can extend the life of the color by greater than 50 . The present compound is also found to be effective in restoring fiberglass gel coats.

Therefore the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact composition and operation shown and described and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to falling within the scope of the invention.
