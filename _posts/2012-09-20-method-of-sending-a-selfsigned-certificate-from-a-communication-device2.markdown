This application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application No. 61 566 154 filed Dec. 2 2011 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Example embodiments relate to the field of security and authentication and more specifically to the field of key certificates.

In a chain of trust scheme certificates are often trusted based on the validity of higher ranking certificates. At the highest level of certificates there is typically a root certificate or self signed certificate which provides the ultimate in attestation authority in the chain of trust scheme.

In some existing conventional systems root certificates are generally pre installed in an operating system pushed through operating system auto updates or through corporate policy controls. The end user typically is not involved in installing root certificates on their computer. Such systems may not permit the user to readily transfer root certificates to create new or temporary secure relationships.

Additional difficulties with existing systems may be appreciated in view of the detailed description below.

Example embodiments generally relate to creating a trust relationship between communication devices by communicating a self signed certificate.

In accordance with an example embodiment there is provided a method of sending a self signed certificate from a communication device the self signed certificate being signed by the communication device. The method includes receiving a communication in relation to establishing a session from a second communication device in proximity to said communication device outputting on an output device of said communication device a certificate hash of the self signed certificate or an address of where to obtain the certificate hash and sending the self signed certificate to said second communication device. The method may also include sending a broadcast message to announce a presence of the communication device.

In accordance with another example embodiment there is provided a communication device comprising a processor memory for storing a self signed certificate the self signed certificate being signed by the communication device an output device and a communication subsystem for sending and receiving communications with a second communication device in proximity to said communication device. The processor is configured for receiving a communication in relation to establishing a session outputting on the output device a certificate hash of the self signed certificate or an address of where to obtain the certificate hash and sending the self signed certificate to said second communication device.

In accordance with yet another aspect there is provided a non transitory computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon executable by a processor for sending a self signed root certificate from a communication device the self signed certificate being signed by the communication device the instructions comprising instructions for performing the method.

In some example embodiments the sending of the self signed certificate is performed over a short range or direct communication channel. In some example embodiments the communication device and the second communication device establish a secured session based on the self signed certificate over a network based channel using a same communication protocol as the short range or direct communication channel. In some example embodiments the short range or direct communication channel is established by implementing protocols from Long Term Evolution LTE protocol.

Reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example embodiments can be applied. The communication system comprises a number of mobile communication devices mobile devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless communication network which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSDPA HSUPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access High Speed Uplink Packet Access Long Term Evolution LTE by 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be required . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email messages to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email messaging server and optionally other servers . The other servers may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile communication devices in the wireless network an application server for implementing server based applications such as instant messaging IM applications or a web server for providing content accessible by a web browser.

For the purposes of the described example embodiments any server within an enterprise network such as a messaging server or any other server will be referred to as an enterprise server. A service may include one or more servers or enterprise servers.

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

Encryption keys used for communications or for encrypting data stored on the device can be protected via various means such as a password or hardware based protections such as those afforded by hardware based key stored mechanisms.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server or other servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or other servers to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server or other servers .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

A mobile device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer such as desktop or notebook computer via the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device and computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared IR connection such as an Infrared Data Association IrDA connection a short range radio frequency RF connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth special interest group IEEE 802.15.3a also referred to as UltraWideband UWB or direct mode communication e.g. a direct mode LTE described in greater detail herein or other PAN connection.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . Example embodiments may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present example embodiments.

Reference is now made to which illustrates a mobile device in which example embodiments can be applied. The mobile device is a two way communication device having data and optionally voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device in various embodiments the device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem.

The mobile device includes a case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The device may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input device and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.

The mobile device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed.

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules comprise operating system software and software applications which for example may include a short messaging application e.g. instant messaging SMS Short Message Service MMS Multimedia Messaging Service etc a web browser a web server and an email messaging application . In some example embodiments the functions performed by each of the applications and may each be realized as a plurality of independent elements and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications . In some example embodiments one or more applications are configured to receive data such as files documents or other information from a server such as a messaging server or a web or other server . Non limiting examples of data received from a server may include email attachments files transferred via file transfer protocol FTP or any other protocol documents or files downloaded from a web page via a web browser or files sent via a text or instant messaging application.

In some examples the software applications may be implemented using a number of services which define the communication protocols used to communicate between a server and an application on the communication device. Some applications may only connect to a single type of server using the same communication protocol settings and will therefore only operate using a single service while other applications may connect to a variety of servers using different communication protocols and will require multiple services. For example a banking application on a communication device may only require a single service defining the communication protocol for securely communicating with the bank s online banking server while a web browser may require many different services such as services for general web page browsing for secure web page browsing for streaming video for accessing corporate web email or for accessing online public email services.

For illustration purposes shows a security module as a component of the operating system . In some example embodiments the security module may perform security functions including the generation and management of private keys and or public keys. The security module may be used to perform the encryption decryption or the signing verification of data using such keys as described in detail herein.

The software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

In some embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational tool input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some embodiments the mobile device includes a removable memory card typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . The mobile device can store data on the removable memory card in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory or on both a removable memory card and in an erasable persistent memory.

In various embodiments the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information word processor documents spreadsheets presentation slides image files audio and video files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

In some embodiments the mobile device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the mobile device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

The mobile device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

In some example embodiments the first communication device is configured to communicate with another communication device using modes switching between a direct mode communication channel and a network facilitated communication channel e.g. network mode . In some example embodiments a same communication protocol and interface may be used for operation of both modes. The direct mode communication channel may be used when the communication device is in proximity to the other device. Switching to the network mode may be performed when the communication devices become out of proximity range.

In an example embodiment the direct mode communication channel may be performed using a direct mode version of LTE. For example LTE communication protocols and an Universal Terrestrial Radio Access E UTRA interface may be used to establish a direct communication channel between the communication device and another device. In an example embodiment the network mode may be performed using LTE over a network such as wireless communication network . The switching control between modes may be implemented as an automated seamless function being able to switch between modes using a same communication protocol e.g. LTE once a security relationship has been established and may switch back to the direct mode when the communication devices are in proximity. For example a same data session between the devices may maintain continuity when switching between modes.

Network components of the wireless communication network may assist in switching between the communication channels or modes. In some example embodiments the network components are used to control radio resources associated with the direct communication channel. For example the network components may initially setup and control spectrum or channel allocation session identifiers etc. in relation to direct mode LTE. Once setup for the direct communication channel is facilitated by the network components the communication devices establish the direct communication channel between each other e.g. thereby by passing or independent of the network components . The same network components may be used to communicate with the communication devices when switching back to LTE over the wireless communication network . The network components may control channel allocation session identifiers etc. in relation to LTE over the wireless communication network .

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a short message e.g. short message service SMS Multimedia Messaging Service MMS an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

Generally example embodiments of the mobile device may utilize asymmetric keys which include related public key private key pairs wherein the key pair can be associated with a specified identity of a user or an electronic device. The mobile device may be configured to implement signing verification or encryption decryption using the associated keys.

For applications a private key may be used by a sender to sign outgoing data and or to decrypt incoming data. A corresponding public key may be used by a recipient to decrypt received data and verify if the sender signed the data using the private key. A public key certificate includes the public key as well as the identity information of a device or of a user of a device. Such a public key certificate may be referred to as an identity key certificate or merely a certificate.

Various examples of verification and authentication processes are described in detail in the ITU T X.509 standard version 11 2008 published by the International Telecommunication Union ITU the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. In an example implementation to sign data the sender creates a hash of the data and then signs the hash with the private key. The sender then sends the signed hash and the certificate along with the data. The recipient after receipt of these items can recreate the hash of the data decrypt the encrypted hash using the public key and check that both hashes are equal and finally verify the certificate. A certificate in accordance with the X.509 standard may sometimes be referred to as an X.509 certificate.

In some example embodiments the mobile device may be configured or operate as a web client via the web browser and or as a server via the web server . The mobile device may be configured to implement encryption or verification using the associated keys. For example the mobile device may store within a key storage one or more public keys one or more private keys or a combination of public keys and private keys. The key storage may include any portion of memory on the device . In some embodiments the memory may include a secure area in which sensitive data such as key material is stored. In some embodiments the secure area may itself be secured using cryptography to prevent unauthorized access.

When implementing or operating as the web server for signing the mobile device can store and use a private key to sign outgoing data. A corresponding public key may be used by a recipient or client to verify that the mobile device signed the data using the private key.

In other example embodiments when receiving data such as when implementing the web browser the mobile device can store and use a public key to verify incoming data as being signed by an associated private key.

In some example embodiments the security module may be used to create or store a key pair. The public key certificate may be a root certificate or a self signed certificate root certificate and self signed certificate are referred to interchangeably herein . In such an instance the mobile device may be referred to as a certificate authority CA as is understood in the art. The root certificate of a CA can be used to verify other public certificates for example in a chain of trust implementation as understood in the art.

An example application of a root certificate is to secure a session or Internet session between parties. For example a second certificate may be created which is signed by the root certificate for example for establishing TLS SSL to implement HTTPS as is understood in the art. Although one example application is web browsing via web server other example applications include peer to peer communications direct mode communication in some example embodiments using e.g. direct mode LTE etc Virtual Private Networks VPN electronic mail Internet faxing instant messaging and voice over IP VoIP .

In example embodiments a thumbprint fingerprint or certificate hash represents the binary data e.g. hexadecimal representation produced by computing or using a hashing algorithm on a certificate or root certificate. The thumbprint may be used to compare with a known hexadecimal representation to verify the root certificate. Although the thumbprint uniquely identifies a certificate the thumbprint cannot be used to re create a certificate as hashing is a one way process.

Reference is now made to which shows in flow diagram form an example method or conversation for sending a self signed key from a first communication device to a second communication device . In some example embodiments the first communication device is configured to operating as the web server or a handheld mobile web server which can have specific software obtained from an applications developer. The web server may function as a tether or bridge for facilitating establishment of a secured web session. In some example embodiments the second communication device includes a common web browser but may not have specific software from an applications developer. For example the second communication device may be a personal computer or a tablet based computer. Other example applications other than web browsing include peer to peer communications direct mode communication using e.g. direct mode communication using LTE etc Virtual Private Networks VPN electronic mail Internet faxing instant messaging and voice over IP VoIP .

In some example embodiments the first communication device and the second communication device are in proximity and initially communicate through a local channel such as through a wireless local area network WLAN or WI FI network. In some example embodiments the first communication device and the second communication device are operated by a same user or local group of users in proximity. In some example embodiments proximity includes a distance wherein a same user or local group of users can control an input device of each and or view an output device of both the first communication device and the second communication device . Depending on the particular circumstances proximity can include the first communication device and the second communication device being within a same facility area or room to establish a direct or short range communication channel such as a wireless local area network WLAN WI FI network or short range networks such as Bluetooth or Near Field Communications NFC . Such mechanisms may be used to determine or trigger when the first communication device and the second communication device are in proximity or close range.

In some example embodiments the first communication device is configured to communicate with another device e.g. the second communication device using modes switching between a direct mode communication channel and a network facilitated communication channel e.g. network mode . In some example embodiments a same communication protocol and interface may be used for operation of both modes. The direct mode communication channel may be used when the communication devices are in proximity to each other. The network mode may be used when the communication devices have established a security relationship and or when the communication devices become out of range.

In some example embodiments the method may begin with the first communication device and the second communication device in an unsecured or un trusted communications session. For example this may include the second communication device not having authorized or injected a root certificate of the first communication device .

Referring still to the method at event may begin with the first communication device generating a self signed certificate for example a X.509 certificate. This may include creating a key pair having a public key and private key. The first communication device may sign the certificate with itself in order to generate the self signed certificate.

In some example embodiments at event the first communication device may send a broadcast message to announce a presence of the communication device to others within a network. In some example embodiments the broadcast message is sent by way of a multicast User Datagram Protocol UDP . The broadcast message may be sent using a discovery protocol such as Simple Service Discovery Protocol SSDP .

At event the second communication device receives the broadcast message and therefore detects the presence of the first communication device . At this stage a presentation URL may be displayed on the second communication device to indicate the first communication device as a device or network in the network neighbourhood or the resident network discovery application. At event the second communication device receives selection of the first communication device for example through a user input. The second communication device sends a response to the broadcast message to the first communication device and the first communication device receives the response shown as event . This communication is an indication from the second communication device that it desires to establish a session. At event the first communication device sends instructions to the second communication device for example by way of a scouting webpage over HTTP. For example the scouting webpage may include instructions for the second communication device to check or verify whether it is permitted to connect to the first communication device as a HTTPS web server. From the instructions if a connection is permitted e.g. a certificate is authorized as determined at event the second communication device can automatically redirect the web browser to the secure URL. Otherwise the instructions can prompt a user selectable option to click on a link to install the self signed certificate. In example embodiments the instructions may be sent in HTML Java script or other suitable languages.

Referring now to event the scouting web page is received and displayed on the second communication device . The instructions from the scouting web page are also interpreted by the second communication device . At event the scouting web page instructs the second communication device to determine whether a root certificate is already authorized or injected within the second communication device . If yes the second communication device is automatically redirected to a secure website and at event a secure session is established. In some example embodiments a timer or counter is used to control the detection of any existing root certificate to wait a specified time to establish the secure session.

If there is no root certificate verified within the second communication device if no the second communication device requests the root certificate from the first communication device . As shown at event the request is received by the first communication device . At event the first communication device sends a copy of the root certificate to the second communication device .

In some example embodiments at event in response to receiving the request at event the first communication device outputs to an output device a certificate hash or thumbprint of the self signed certificate for example displayed on the display or output to the speaker .

In other example embodiments still referring to event the first communication device may display an interface on the display which includes an address of where to obtain the certificate hash. For example the address may indicate an address of the first communication device such as another web page or ftp site of the first communication device . In other example embodiments the address may indicate a website or link of an exterior device to retrieve the certificate hash. The address can include a link hyperlink HTML address or pointer. The address may be selected to direct the first communication device to retrieve the certificate hash wherein the certificate hash is then output to the output device. This can permit a user or local group of users of the devices to compare the certificate hash to verify the self signed certificate.

At event the self signed certificate is received by the second communication device . A hash of the self signed certificate can be computed by the second communication device and output to an output device such as a display or speaker. At this stage the second communication device can authorize the self signed certificate by comparing the computed hash with the certificate hash displayed on the first communication device . The calculation and availability of the computed hash may depend on the particular system or application but can typically be displayed from a configuration menu or security interface or may be implemented from a web browser. In some example embodiments a user verification may also be performed to manually compare the certificate hash for example the user may have access to both the first communication device and the second communication device .

At event it is determined whether the self signed certificate is accepted or authorized by the second communication device which may include receiving a user input confirming authorization of the self signed certificate. For example the self signed certificate may not be accepted if the certificate hash does not match or for any other reason. If this is the case if no then the method may end as shown at event . The end event may include sending a message to the first communication device rejecting the certificate.

If the self signed certificate is accepted or authorized by the second communication device if yes the method proceeds to event which includes authorizing or injecting the self signed certificate and storing the self signed certificate within the second communication device . At this stage a secure and trusted connection can now be established with the first communication device . For example as shown in the method may proceed again to event in an attempt to establish or re establish a secure connection. The second communication device determines whether a root certificate is authorized or injected within the second communication device .

The method thus proceeds to event to establish a secured session after successful verification of the self signed certificate. For example a second certificate can be generated by the first communication device which is signed by the self signed certificate and a secure HTTPS session can be established. In some example embodiments the second certificate can be bound to an identity of the first communication device such as a network identifier e.g. MAC address IP address and a common name or to an identity of a user of the first communication device . In other example embodiments other secure sessions may be established such as a peer to peer session or a direct mode communication session.

In some example embodiments now that the second communication device has successfully verified the self signed certificates a secured connection can now be secured over a same network or direct connection or over another network. For example a secured session can be established over a high speed link such as over WI FI.

In another example embodiment the various communications of the method are sent using direct mode communication channel using LTE. Once the self signed certificate has been verified the secured session can be established by switching over to another connection such as a network mode communication channel e.g. LTE over wireless communication network . This may be implemented as an automated seamless function after verifying of the self signed certificate.

In another example embodiment the various communications of the method are sent using a short range network such as WI FI Bluetooth or Near Field Communications NFC . Once the self signed certificate has been verified the first communication device and the second communication device establish a secure direct mode communication channel using LTE. This session may be maintained between the first communication device and the second communication device . When the devices become remote and leave a proximity range or area the devices may switch modes to implement LTE over wireless communication network . This may be performed seamlessly to maintain any existing data session.

Referring again to event in some example embodiments the first communication device may temporarily display a dialog box which displays the certificate hash or address. The first communication device may also perform removing of the dialog box when the self signed certificate is accepted by the second communication device . In other example embodiments the certificate hash or address is displayed by the first communication device in response to other events for example at events or . In some example embodiments the certificate hash or address is continually displayed and may be removed upon acceptance from the second communication device .

Reference is now made to which shows an example interface screen as displayed on the first communication device in order to implement at least some embodiments of the method of . As shown in the interface screen a certificate hash field can display the certificate hash in alphanumeric form e.g. visible alphanumerals .

The options interface screen may alternatively display an address or link of where to retrieve the certificate hash.

Referring again to event in in some example embodiments the first communication device may display a popup window for displaying of the certificate hash or the address or for displaying of the options screen .

Reference is now made to which shows in flow diagram form an example method or conversation for mutual exchanging of self signed certificates between a first communication device and a second communication device in accordance with an example embodiment.

Some example embodiments relate to using a low speed channel to secure a high speed channel. For example Bluetooth is an example of a low speed channel wherein requesting large amounts of data can be slow. Near Field Communications NFC is an example of a low speed channel wherein requesting large amounts of data can be slow. Some example embodiments may use the secured channel to subsequently facilitate a HTTPS session over a high speed connection such as WIFI. Other example applications other than HTTPS may also take advantage of the secure relationship to be established. Some further example embodiments relate to using a direct communication channel to secure a network communication channel. For example a direct mode LTE is an example of a direct communication channel while LTE over wireless communication network is an example of a network communication channel.

In some example embodiments the first communication device and the second communication device may each have specific software obtained from an applications developer. In some example embodiments one of the communication devices is configured to operating as the web server or a handheld mobile web server. The other of the communication devices is configured to operate using the web browser . For example the web server may be implemented on a handheld mobile communication device while the web browser may be implemented on a tablet based mobile communication device.

The method may begin with the first communication device generating a first self signed certificate. Similarly the second mobile communication device may also perform generating a second self signed certificate. For example the self signed certificates may be X.509 certificates.

The method at event establishes a proximity session such as a Bluetooth connection. For example a secure session may be generated in Bluetooth which is independent of the security of any HTTPS session. At event the first communication device sends the first self signed certificate to the second communication device . In some example embodiments an HTTP POST with the contents of the first self signed certificate is sent to the second communication device

At event the second communication device receives the first self signed certificate within the HTTP POST. The second communication device authorizes and stores the first self signed certificate within a key storage . At event the second communication device creates a HTTP Response which includes the second self signed certificate. At event the first communication device receives the second self signed certificate within the HTTP Response. The first communication device authorizes and stores the second self signed certificate within a key storage .

Accordingly the second communication device can connect to the first communication device as web server and vice versa. Having exchanged the self signed certificates a secured connection can now be secured over a same short range or direct connection. In other example embodiments a secured connection can be secured over another network. For example a secured session can be established over a high speed link such as over WI FI rather than the Bluetooth connection. It would be appreciated that by having a mutual exchange of self signed certificates a two way trust relationship is created between the communication devices 

In some example embodiments the first communication device may send to the second communication device a certificate hash of the first self signed certificate or an address of where to obtain the certificate hash. The first communication device may display the certificate hash on an output device of the first communication device . The second communication device may compare the certificate hash to confirm or authorize the first self signed certificate. Similarly the second communication device may send to the first communication device a certificate hash of the second self signed certificate or an address of where to obtain the certificate hash. The second communication device may display the certificate hash on an output device of the second communication device The first communication device may compare the certificate hash to confirm or authorize the second self signed certificate.

In some example embodiments at least some of the communications may be performed over a Bluetooth or over Near Field Communications NFC . In some example embodiments some or all of the events of the method of may be implemented within the method of .

In some other example embodiments at event a direct mode LTE session is established. After exchanging the self signed certificates the second communication device can connect to the first communication device by switching over to a network mode communication channel at a wider range such as LTE over wireless communication network .

In another example embodiment at event a short range network such as Bluetooth or Near Field Communications NFC is established. Once both of the self signed certificates have been verified the first communication device and the second communication device establish a secure direct mode communication channel using LTE. This session may be maintained between the first communication device and the second communication device . When the devices become remote and leave a proximity range or area the devices may switch modes to implement LTE over wireless communication network . This may be performed seamlessly to maintain any existing data session.

Some example embodiments may be applied to a chain of trust implementation. In a chain of trust certificates are often trusted based on the validity of higher ranking certificates. Certificates are issued and signed by certificates that reside higher in the certificate hierarchy so the validity and trustworthiness of a given certificate is determined by the corresponding validity of the certificate associated with the certificate authority that signed the given certificate. Thus there is often a root CA which provides the ultimate in attestation authority in that chain of trust implementation using the root certificate. Accordingly the trust anchor for the digital certificate is the root certificate authority. The root certificate from the mobile device as CA may be communicated to a client in accordance with at least some of the described example embodiments.

Some example embodiments may be applied to a web of trust environment wherein there is no central CA per se and accordingly identity certificates for some or all of the clients may be self signed. In this case the additional signatures from some or all of the other clients are evaluated to determine whether a certificate should be accepted as correct. Each generated certificate may be communicated between each of the devices. For example at least the certificate from the mobile device may be communicated to at least another client in the web of trust in accordance with the described example embodiments. At least some of the remaining clients may similarly implement at least some of the described example embodiments.
