The present application relates to account registration and in particular confirmation of account registration in a social networking system.

Social networking websites provide a dynamic environment in which members can connect to and communicate with other members. These websites may commonly provide online mechanisms allowing members to interact within their preexisting social networks as well as create new social networks. Members may include any individual or entity such as an organization or business. Among other attributes social networking websites allow members to effectively and efficiently communicate relevant information to their social networks.

A member of a social network may highlight or share personal information news stories relationship activities music and any other content of interest to areas of the website dedicated to the member. Other members of the social network may access the shared content by browsing member profiles or performing dedicated searches. Upon access to and consideration of the content the other members may react by taking one or more responsive actions such as providing an opinion about the content or other feedback. The ability of members to interact in this manner fosters communications among them and helps to realize the goals of social networking websites.

Tools for accessing social networking websites from a variety of technology platforms have grown along with the tools for accessing the Internet in general. Initially many users accessed the Internet exclusively from desktop computers. User interfaces of social networking websites accordingly were designed for desktop web browsers. However the growing popularity of mobile computing has facilitated Internet access from a variety of different devices and platforms. Likewise more users seek to participate in social networking websites within a mobile computing paradigm.

To determine whether to confirm account registrations with a social networking system embodiments of the invention include systems methods and computer readable media to receive an MSISDN associated with a mobile device. It is determined whether to confirm registration of an account with a social networking system based at least in part on the MSISDN.

In an embodiment receiving the MSISDN includes receiving an HTTP request. The HTTP request may include an HTTP header with the MSISDN.

In an embodiment a phone number associated with the mobile device may be received. An HTTP request may include the MSISDN and the phone number.

In an embodiment registration may be confirmed based on a match between the MSISDN and the phone number. A user associated with the registration may be notified about the confirmed registration. The registration may be confirmed without providing a dedicated message about the registration from the social networking system.

In an embodiment registration may be refused based on absence of a match between the MSISDN and the phone number. A user associated with the registration may be notified about the refused registration. The registration may be refused without providing a dedicated message about the registration from the social networking system.

In an embodiment account registration information including a phone number associated with the mobile device may be received. The account registration information may be requested in a registration form provided to a user.

In an embodiment the MSISDN may be provided by a wireless carrier server. The wireless carrier server may provide a signature. An IP address associated with a request including the MSISDN and an IP address of the wireless carrier server may be compared.

In an embodiment the MSISDN may be provided from a wireless communication service provider to the social networking system based on agreement between the wireless communication service provider and the social networking system.

Many other features and embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the following detailed description.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only wherein the figures use like reference numerals to identify like elements. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated in the figures may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The user device comprises one or more computing devices that can receive input from a user and transmit and receive data via the network . In one embodiment the user device is a conventional computer system executing for example a Microsoft Windows compatible operating system OS Apple OS X and or a Linux distribution. In another embodiment the user device can be a device having computer functionality such as a smart phone a tablet a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone etc. The user device is configured to communicate via the network . The user device can execute an application for example a browser application that allows a user of the user device to interact with the social networking system . In another embodiment the user device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API provided by the native operating system of the user device such as iOS and ANDROID. The user device is configured to communicate with the external system and the social networking system via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using wired and or wireless communication systems.

In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and protocols. Thus the network can include links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G CDMA GSM LTE digital subscriber line DSL etc. Similarly the networking protocols used on the network can include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP User Datagram Protocol UDP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP file transfer protocol FTP and the like. The data exchanged over the network can be represented using technologies and or formats including hypertext markup language HTML and extensible markup language XML . In addition all or some links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS and Internet Protocol security IPsec .

In one embodiment the user device may display content from the external system and or from the social networking system by processing a markup language document received from the external system and from the social networking system using a browser application . The markup language document identifies content and one or more instructions describing formatting or presentation of the content. By executing the instructions included in the markup language document the browser application displays the identified content using the format or presentation described by the markup language document . For example the markup language document includes instructions for generating and displaying a web page having multiple frames that include text and or image data retrieved from the external system and the social networking system . In various embodiments the markup language document comprises a data file including extensible markup language XML data extensible hypertext markup language XHTML data or other markup language data. Additionally the markup language document may include JavaScript Object Notation JSON data JSON with padding JSONP and JavaScript data to facilitate data interchange between the external system and the user device . The browser application on the user device may use a JavaScript compiler to decode the markup language document .

The markup language document may also include or link to applications or application frameworks such as FLASH or Unity applications the SilverLight application framework etc.

In one embodiment the user device also includes one or more cookies including data indicating whether a user of the user device is logged into the social networking system which may enable customization of the data communicated from the social networking system to the user device .

The external system includes one or more web servers that include one or more web pages which are communicated to the user device using the network . The external system is separate from the social networking system . For example the external system is associated with a first domain while the social networking system is associated with a separate social networking domain. Web pages included in the external system comprise markup language documents identifying content and including instructions specifying formatting or presentation of the identified content.

The social networking system includes one or more computing devices for a social network including a plurality of users and providing users of the social network with the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social network. In some instances the social network can be represented by a graph i.e. a data structure including edges and nodes. Other data structures can also be used to represent the social network including but not limited to databases objects classes meta elements files or any other data structure.

Users may join the social networking system and then add connections to any number of other users of the social networking system to whom they desire to be connected. As used herein the term friend refers to any other user of the social networking system to whom a user has formed a connection association or relationship via the social networking system . For example in an embodiment if users in the social networking system are represented as nodes in the social graph the term friend can refer to an edge formed between and directly connecting two user nodes.

Connections may be added explicitly by a user or may be automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users e.g. users who are alumni of the same educational institution . For example a first user specifically selects a particular other user to be a friend. Connections in the social networking system are usually in both directions but need not be so the terms user and friend depend on the frame of reference. Connections between users of the social networking system are usually bilateral two way or mutual but connections may also be unilateral or one way. For example if Bob and Joe are both users of the social networking system and connected to each other Bob and Joe are each other s connections. If on the other hand Bob wishes to connect to Joe to view data communicated to the social networking system by Joe but Joe does not wish to form a mutual connection a unilateral connection may be established. The connection between users may be a direct connection however some embodiments of the social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections or degrees of separation.

In addition to establishing and maintaining connections between users and allowing interactions between users the social networking system provides users with the ability to take actions on various types of items supported by the social networking system . These items may include groups or networks i.e. social networks of people entities and concepts to which users of the social networking system may belong events or calendar entries in which a user might be interested computer based applications that a user may use via the social networking system transactions that allow users to buy or sell items via services provided by or through the social networking system and interactions with advertisements that a user may perform on or off the social networking system . These are just a few examples of the items upon which a user may act on the social networking system and many others are possible. A user may interact with anything that is capable of being represented in the social networking system or in the external system separate from the social networking system or coupled to the social networking system via the network .

The social networking system is also capable of linking a variety of entities. For example the social networking system enables users to interact with each other as well as external systems or other entities through an API a web service or other communication channels. The social networking system generates and maintains the social graph comprising a plurality of nodes interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph may represent an entity that can act on another node and or that can be acted on by another node. The social graph may include various types of nodes. Examples of types of nodes include users non person entities content items web pages groups activities messages concepts and any other things that can be represented by an object in the social networking system . An edge between two nodes in the social graph may represent a particular kind of connection or association between the two nodes which may result from node relationships or from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node. In some cases the edges between nodes can be weighted. The weight of an edge can represent an attribute associated with the edge such as a strength of the connection or association between nodes. Different types of edges can be provided with different weights. For example an edge created when one user likes another user may be given one weight while an edge created when a user befriends another user may be given a different weight.

As an example when a first user identifies a second user as a friend an edge in the social graph is generated connecting a node representing the first user and a second node representing the second user. As various nodes relate or interact with each other the social networking system modifies edges connecting the various nodes to reflect the relationships and interactions.

The social networking system also includes user generated content which enhances a user s interactions with the social networking system . User generated content may include anything a user can add upload send or post to the social networking system . For example a user communicates posts to the social networking system from a user device . Posts may include data such as status updates or other textual data location information images such as photos videos links music or other similar data and or media. Content may also be added to the social networking system by a third party. Content items are represented as objects in the social networking system . In this way users of the social networking system are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media through various communication channels. Such communication increases the interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact with the social networking system .

The social networking system includes a web server an API request server a user profile store a connection store an action logger an activity log an authorization server and a registration module . In an embodiment of the invention the social networking system may include additional fewer or different components for various applications. Other components including but not limited to network interfaces security mechanisms load balancers failover servers management and network operations consoles and the like are not shown so as to not obscure the details of the system.

The user profile store maintains information about user accounts including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history hobbies or preferences location and the like that has been declared by users or inferred by the social networking system . This information is stored in the user profile store such that each user is uniquely identified. The social networking system also stores data describing one or more connections between different users in the connection store . The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work experience group memberships hobbies or educational history. Additionally the social networking system includes user defined connections between different users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example user defined connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Users may select from predefined types of connections or define their own connection types as needed. Connections with other nodes in the social networking system such as non person entities buckets cluster centers images interests pages external systems concepts and the like are also stored in the connection store .

The social networking system maintains data about objects with which a user may interact. To maintain this data the user profile store and the connection store store instances of the corresponding type of objects maintained by the social networking system . Each object type has information fields that are suitable for storing information appropriate to the type of object. For example the user profile store contains data structures with fields suitable for describing a user s account and information related to a user s account. When a new object of a particular type is created the social networking system initializes a new data structure of the corresponding type assigns a unique object identifier to it and begins to add data to the object as needed. This might occur for example when a user becomes a user of the social networking system the social networking system generates a new instance of a user profile in the user profile store assigns a unique identifier to the user account and begins to populate the fields of the user account with information provided by the user.

The connection store includes data structures suitable for describing a user s connections to other users connections to external systems or connections to other entities. The connection store may also associate a connection type with a user s connections which may be used in conjunction with the user s privacy setting to regulate access to information about the user. In an embodiment of the invention the user profile store and the connection store may be implemented as a federated database.

Data stored in the connection store the user profile store and the activity log enables the social networking system to generate the social graph that uses nodes to identify various objects and edges connecting nodes to identify relationships between different objects. For example if a first user establishes a connection with a second user in the social networking system user accounts of the first user and the second user from the user profile store may act as nodes in the social graph. The connection between the first user and the second user stored by the connection store is an edge between the nodes associated with the first user and the second user. Continuing this example the second user may then send the first user a message within the social networking system . The action of sending the message which may be stored is another edge between the two nodes in the social graph representing the first user and the second user. Additionally the message itself may be identified and included in the social graph as another node connected to the nodes representing the first user and the second user.

In another example a first user may tag a second user in an image that is maintained by the social networking system or alternatively in an image maintained by another system outside of the social networking system . The image may itself be represented as a node in the social networking system . This tagging action may create edges between the first user and the second user as well as create an edge between each of the users and the image which is also a node in the social graph. In yet another example if a user confirms attending an event the user and the event are nodes obtained from the user profile store where the attendance of the event is an edge between the nodes that may be retrieved from the activity log . By generating and maintaining the social graph the social networking system includes data describing many different types of objects and the interactions and connections among those objects providing a rich source of socially relevant information.

The web server links the social networking system to one or more user devices and or one or more external systems via the network . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java JavaScript Flash XML and so forth. The web server may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system and one or more user devices . The messages can be instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS messages or any other suitable messaging format.

The API request server allows one or more external systems and user devices to call access information from the social networking system by calling one or more API functions. The API request server may also allow external systems to send information to the social networking system by calling APIs. The external system in one embodiment sends an API request to the social networking system via the network and the API request server receives the API request. The API request server processes the request by calling an API associated with the API request to generate an appropriate response which the API request server communicates to the external system via the network . For example responsive to an API request the API request server collects data associated with a user such as the user s connections that have logged into the external system and communicates the collected data to the external system . In another embodiment the user device communicates with the social networking system via APIs in the same manner as external systems .

The action logger is capable of receiving communications from the web server about user actions on and or off the social networking system . The action logger populates the activity log with information about user actions enabling the social networking system to discover various actions taken by its users within the social networking system and outside of the social networking system . Any action that a particular user takes with respect to another node on the social networking system may be associated with each user s account through information maintained in the activity log or in a similar database or other data repository. Examples of actions taken by a user within the social networking system that are identified and stored may include for example adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user posting an image attempting to post an image or other actions interacting with another user or another object. When a user takes an action within the social networking system the action is recorded in the activity log . In one embodiment the social networking system maintains the activity log as a database of entries. When an action is taken within the social networking system an entry for the action is added to the activity log . The activity log may be referred to as an action log.

Additionally user actions may be associated with concepts and actions that occur within an entity outside of the social networking system such as an external system that is separate from the social networking system . For example the action logger may receive data describing a user s interaction with an external system from the web server . In this example the external system reports a user s interaction according to structured actions and objects in the social graph.

Other examples of actions where a user interacts with an external system include a user expressing an interest in an external system or another entity a user posting a comment to the social networking system that discusses an external system or a web page within the external system a user posting to the social networking system a Uniform Resource Locator URL or other identifier associated with an external system a user attending an event associated with an external system or any other action by a user that is related to an external system . Thus the activity log may include actions describing interactions between a user of the social networking system and an external system that is separate from the social networking system .

The authorization server enforces one or more privacy settings of the users of the social networking system . A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared. The privacy setting comprises the specification of particular information associated with a user and the specification of the entity or entities with whom the information can be shared. Examples of entities with which information can be shared may include other users applications external systems or any entity that can potentially access the information. The information that can be shared by a user comprises user account information such as profile photos phone numbers associated with the user user s connections actions taken by the user such as adding a connection changing user profile information and the like.

The privacy setting specification may be provided at different levels of granularity. For example the privacy setting may identify specific information to be shared with other users the privacy setting identifies a work phone number or a specific set of related information such as personal information including profile photo home phone number and status. Alternatively the privacy setting may apply to all the information associated with the user. The specification of the set of entities that can access particular information can also be specified at various levels of granularity. Various sets of entities with which information can be shared may include for example all friends of the user all friends of friends all applications or all external systems . One embodiment allows the specification of the set of entities to comprise an enumeration of entities. For example the user may provide a list of external systems that are allowed to access certain information. Another embodiment allows the specification to comprise a set of entities along with exceptions that are not allowed to access the information. For example a user may allow all external systems to access the user s work information but specify a list of external systems that are not allowed to access the work information. Certain embodiments call the list of exceptions that are not allowed to access certain information a block list . External systems belonging to a block list specified by a user are blocked from accessing the information specified in the privacy setting. Various combinations of granularity of specification of information and granularity of specification of entities with which information is shared are possible. For example all personal information may be shared with friends whereas all work information may be shared with friends of friends.

The authorization server contains logic to determine if certain information associated with a user can be accessed by a user s friends external systems and or other applications and entities. The external system may need authorization from the authorization server to access the user s more private and sensitive information such as the user s work phone number. Based on the user s privacy settings the authorization server determines if another user the external system an application or another entity is allowed to access information associated with the user including information about actions taken by the user.

The registration module manages the registration of accounts with the social networking system . The registration module controls the registration of users who may access the social networking system from mobile computing systems such as the user device . As described in more detail below the registration module verifies account registration information and confirms registration of an account with the social networking system .

Account registration with the social networking website may involve a user visiting a webpage such as a home page of the social networking website. The webpage may include a button such as a Sign Up button that links to a registration form. When downloaded the registration form may prompt the user to provide various information such as the name of the user a valid email address of the user a password the gender of the user the birthday of the user and perhaps other identifying or demographic information. Once the registration information is entered and submitted the social networking website may send a message to the email address provided in the registration form. The message may include a link as well as an instruction for the user to click the link. The social networking website may require the user to click the link to confirm the account registration. Upon such confirmation the account will be active and available for use.

A mobile device capable of accessing the social networking website may be used to register an account with the social networking website. For the mobile device the social networking website can provide a registration form that may prompt the user for a phone number associated with the mobile device. To confirm the account registration the social networking website may cause a message such as an SMS text to be addressed to the phone number provided in the registration form. The message may include a code to be typed by the user and returned to the social networking website. In some instances the social networking website may direct a wireless communication service provider to which the user may be subscribed to deliver the message to the mobile device. In other instances the social networking website may request another type of entity such as an aggregator company to cause the message to be provided by the user. In either instance message delivery can be unreliable due to variety of factors. When the message is not delivered to the mobile device the user cannot provide the confirmation necessary to complete the process for account registration.

For account registration by the user the social networking system may provide a registration form to the mobile device . illustrates an example registration form in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In an embodiment the registration form may be presented as part of a web page of the social networking system for display on the mobile device . The registration form may include a field and a field for the user to enter her first name and last name respectively a field for the user to enter the phone number of the mobile device a select list and select lists for the user to select her gender and birth date respectively and a field for the user to enter a password. In an embodiment a registration form for account registration with the social networking system may prompt the user to provide types of information other than as shown in the registration form . The registration form also may include a sign up button . Upon selection of the sign up button the account registration information provided by the user may be transmitted from the mobile device .

The account registration information may be provided to the social networking system through the wireless carrier server . The account registration information may be communicated as an HTTP request from the mobile device to the wireless carrier server . Upon receipt of the account registration information the wireless carrier server may relay the account registration information to the social networking system . In an embodiment the account registration information may be communicated as an HTTP request from the wireless carrier server to the social networking system .

The wireless carrier server may include in the HTTP request a header having the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network Number MSISDN associated with the mobile device . The MSISDN is a number uniquely identifying a subscription in a wireless communication network such as GSM or UMTS. The MSISDN may be comprised of different constituent parts including a country code CC a national destination code NDC or number planning area NPA and a subscriber number SN . In an embodiment the appearance of MSISDNs in headers of HTTP requests may result from agreement between the wireless communication service provider in control of the wireless carrier server and the operator of the social networking system to include such information.

As shown in the social networking system may receive the HTTP request relayed by the wireless carrier server and use the MSISDN in the account registration process. The registration module of the social networking system may compare the MSISDN of the mobile device with the phone number provided by the user in the registration form . In an embodiment when the phone number provided by the user and the MSISDN provided by the wireless carrier server match the social networking system may determine that account registration information is correct and that the attempt to register the account is proper. Thus when the phone number and the MSISDN match the registration module may confirm account registration. In an embodiment the registration module or the social networking system may cause a notice to be provided to the user that the attempt to register an account was successful.

In an embodiment when the phone number provided by the user and the MSISDN provided by the wireless carrier server do not match the social networking system may determine that account registration information is not correct or that the attempt to register the account is not proper. Thus in the absence of a match between the phone number and the MSISDN the registration module may refuse account registration. The social networking system accordingly may take appropriate remedial action. For example appropriate remedial action may include blocking registration of the account. As another example appropriate remedial action may include one or more of the following responses by the social networking system notifying the user that the phone number and the MSISDN do not match requesting the user to retry the registration with correct information and associating the account registration information and the MSISDN with a spammer entity.

The determination of a possible match between the phone number provided by the user and the MSISDN provided by the wireless carrier server may be determined in various manners. For example a match may be determined when the phone number is identical to the MSISDN without consideration of a portion of the MSISDN such as a country code. As another example a match may be determined when some all or a threshold number of digits in the phone number and the MSISDN are identical.

Receipt by the social networking system of the phone number of a mobile device provided by a user and the MSISDN provided by a wireless mobile carrier allows for streamlined confirmation or refusal of an account registration. Such confirmation or refusal may be performed without the conventional need for separate provision by the social networking system or another entity of a dedicated message to the mobile device to prompt additional action by the user to verify account registration information. In this manner a convention step in the process for account registration may be eliminated.

In an embodiment additional security measures may be taken to verify that the HTTP request in fact came from the wireless carrier server and that the MSISDN therein is correct. For example the wireless carrier server may provide a signature for the headers in the HTTP request. As another example the social networking system may compare the IP address of the source of the HTTP request with known IP addresses of wireless carrier servers to confirm that the request was provided by an appropriate entity. Other security measures may be suitable as well.
