The present application is related to the following copending U.S. patent applications each of which having been filed on even date herewith each of which also having their contents being incorporated by reference herein in their entirety 

The present invention relates generally to online social media and more particularly to online community advocacy management.

Computer users are able to access and share vast amounts of information through various local and wide area computer networks including proprietary networks as well as public networks such as the Internet. Typically a web browser installed on a user s computing device facilitates access to and interaction with information located at various network servers identified by for example associated uniform resource locators URLs .

In particular over the past several years the amount of personal information that individuals share online has increased dramatically. Many websites provide an online community that provides content focusing on a common interest or theme e.g. a fan site for a television program or musical artist and allows people to join the online community and share personal information with other members of the online community.

Conventional approaches to enable sharing of user generated content include various information sharing technologies or platforms such as social networking websites. Such websites may include be linked with or provide a platform for is applications enabling users to view profile pages created or customized by other users where visibility and interaction with such profiles by other users is governed by some characteristic set of rules. By way of example a user profile may include such user declared information as contact information e.g. physical and email addresses telephone numbers instant messaging nicknames etc. background information job career information as well as personal interests. Operators of online social networking sites typically require that new members provide certain personal information to join including contact information and identifying information e.g. a name location age etc. .

Typically members of an online social network communicate with one another and meet other members based on personal information captured in the other member profiles. Also members of online social networks often request their existing friends to join creating a web of online relationships that mirror offline ones. A positive consequence of this general trend is the greater ability for groups of friends families and other acquaintances to communicate online with and about each other as members of a social network. For example a group of friends may share personal information with each other about common interests individual personal attributes events schedules and activity plans and may also access each others personal information. Another benefit of online social networks is that members can more easily find others who share common interests goals lifestyles etc. without being limited to an online community dedicated to a particular interest. Doing so allows members to expand their social networks.

Social networking websites typically provide mechanisms referred to as channels for members to communicate with each other e.g. emails invitations notifications newsfeeds etc. Social networking applications typically make use of the various channels to provide useful features to the members such as sending out emails about the member s activities displaying a newsfeed to the member s friends and so forth.

Some social network websites provide application developers with the ability to create applications that extend the functionality of the social networking website to is provide new ways for users to interact with each other. For example an application may provide an interesting way for a member also called user of the social networking website to communicate with his friends or allow users to participate in multi player games or collect some interesting information such as news related to a specific topic and display it to the member periodically another application may provide a newsfeed about the activities of the member to that member s friends.

For an online community advocacy management platform techniques APIs are described for pulling comments in from the app plug in and cross pollinating the social online community e.g. social network website walls and app plug in content in an intelligent manner which content how often etc. .

A social networking website offers its members the ability to communicate and interact with other members of the website within an online community . In use members join the social networking website and then add connections to a number of other members to whom they desire to be connected. As used herein the term friend refers to any other member to whom a member has formed a connection association or relationship via the website. Connections may be added explicitly by a member for example the member selecting a particular other member to be a friend or automatically created by the social networking site based on common characteristics of the members e.g. members who are alumni of the same educational institution . Connections in social networking websites are usually in both directions but need not be so the terms member and friend depend on the frame of reference. For example if Bob and Joe are both members and connected to each other in the website Bob and Joe both members are also each other s friends. The connection between members may be a direct connection however some embodiments of a social networking website allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections. Also the term friend need not require that members actually be friends in real life which would generally be the case when one of the members is a business or other entity it simply implies a connection in the social networking website.

Particular embodiments herein relate to a social network environment that includes an infrastructure or platform hereinafter infrastructure and platform may be used interchangeably enabling an integrated social network environment. In the present disclosure the social network environment may be described in terms of a social graph including social graph information. In particular embodiments one or more computing systems of the social network environment implementing the social network environment include store or have access to a data structure that includes social graph information for use in implementing the social network environment described herein. In particular embodiments the social graph information includes a first set of user nodes that each correspond to a respective user and a second set of concept nodes that each correspond to a respective concept. As used herein a user or member may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment. As used herein a concept may refer to virtually anything that a user may declare or otherwise demonstrate an interest in a like towards or a relationship with such as by way of example a sport a sports team a genre of music a musical composer a hobby a business enterprise an entity a group a third party application a celebrity a person who is not a registered user etc. In particular embodiments each node has represents or is represented by a corresponding web page profile page hosted or accessible in the social network environment. By way of example a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user can add content make declarations and otherwise express him or herself while a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page hub in which a plurality of users can add content make declarations and express themselves particularly in relation to the concept. In particular embodiments the social graph information further includes a plurality of edges that each define or represent a connection between a corresponding pair of nodes in the social graph.

As used herein a connection may represent a defined relationship between users or concepts of the social network environment which can be defined logically in a suitable data structure of the social network environment and can be used to define a relationship hereinafter referred to as an edge between the nodes corresponding to the users or concepts of the social network environment for which the connection has been made. As used herein a friendship represents a connection such as a defined social relationship between a pair of users of the social network environment. A friend as used herein may refer to any user of the social network environment with which another user has formed a connection friendship association or relationship with causing an edge to be generated between the two users. By way of example two registered users may become friends with one another explicitly such as for example by one of the two users selecting the other for friendship as a result of transmitting or causing to be transmitted a friendship request to the other user who may then accept or deny the request. Alternately friendships or other connections may be automatically established. Such a social friendship may be visible to other users especially those who themselves are friends with one or both of the registered users. A friend of a registered user may also have increased access privileges to content especially user generated or declared content on the registered user s profile or other page. As noted above however two users who have a friend connection established between them in the social graph may not necessarily be friends in the conventional sense in real life outside the social networking environment . For example in some implementations a user may be a business or other non human entity and thus incapable of being a friend with a human being user in the traditional sense of the word.

As used herein a fan may refer to a user that is a supporter of a particular web page web application or other web content accessible in the social network environment. In particular embodiments when a user is a fan of a particular web page fans the particular web page the user may be listed on that page as a fan for other registered users or the public in general to see. Additionally an avatar or profile picture of the user may be shown on the page or in on any of the pages described below . As used herein a like may refer to something such as by way of example and not by way of limitation an interest a link a piece of media e.g. photo photo album video song etc. a concept an entity or a page that a user and particularly a registered or authenticated user has declared or otherwise demonstrated that he or she likes is a fan of as used herein in various example embodiments to like or to fan something such as a concept or concept profile page may be defined equivalently in the social networking environment and may be used interchangeably similarly to declare oneself a fan of something such as a concept or concept profile page or to declare that oneself likes the thing may be defined equivalently in the social networking environment and used interchangeably herein supports enjoys or otherwise has a positive view of. As used herein an interest may refer to a user declared interest such as a user declared interest presented in the user s profile page. As used herein a want may refer to virtually anything that a user wants. As described above a concept may refer to virtually anything that a user is may declare or otherwise demonstrate an interest in a like towards or a relationship with such as by way of example a sport a sports team a genre of music a musical composer a hobby a business enterprise an entity a group a celebrity a person who is not a registered user or even in some embodiments another user e.g. a non authenticated user etc. By way of example there may be a concept node and concept profile page for Tom Brady the framed professional football player created and administered by one or more of a plurality of users e.g. other than Tom Brady while the social graph additionally includes a user node and user profile page for Tom Brady created by and administered by Tom Brady himself. In particular embodiments as will be described in more detail below a friend connection or friendship may define or indicate a logical connection defined or represented by an edge between user nodes in the social graph while a like want fan or other connection demonstrating generally an interest or association may define a logical connection or edge between a user node and a concept node in the social graph and in some embodiments between two user nodes or between two concept nodes .

As noted above a social network is generally defined by the relationships among groups of individuals and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two individuals. In addition the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two members is a measure of relatedness between the two members.

Degrees of separation in a social network are defined relative to an individual. For example in ME s social network H and ME are separated by 2 d s whereas in G s social network H and G are separated by only 1 d s. Accordingly each individual will have their own set of first second and third degree relationships.

As those skilled in the art understand an individual s social network may be extended to include nodes to an Nth degree of separation. As the number of degrees increases beyond three however the number of nodes typically grows at an explosive rate and quickly begins to mirror the ALL set.

Particular embodiments may operate in or in conjunction with a wide area network environment such as the Internet including multiple network addressable systems. illustrates an example network environment in which various example embodiments may operate with particular detailed views shown in . Network cloud generally represents one or more interconnected networks over which various systems and hosts described herein may communicate. Network cloud may include packet based wide area networks such as the Internet private networks wireless networks satellite networks cellular networks paging networks and the like. As illustrates particular embodiments may operate in conjunction with a network environment comprising social network environment and client devices as well as in some embodiments one or more third party web application servers or one or more enterprise servers . Client devices web application servers and enterprise servers may be operably connected to the network environment and network cloud via a network service provider a wireless carrier a set of routers or networking switches or any other suitable means.

Each client device web application server or enterprise server may generally be a computer computing system or computing device including functionality for communicating e.g. remotely over a computer network. Client device in particular may be a desktop computer laptop computer personal digital assistant PDA is in or out of car navigation system smart phone or other cellular or mobile device or mobile gaming device among other suitable computing devices. Client device may execute one or more client applications such as a web browser e.g. MICROSOFT WINDOWS INTERNET EXPLORER MOZILLA FIREFOX APPLE SAFARI GOOGLE CHROME etc. web browser as illustrated in below to access and view content over a computer network . In particular implementations the client applications allow a user of client device to enter addresses of specific network resources to be retrieved such as resources hosted by social network environment web application servers or enterprise servers . These addresses can be Uniform Resource Locators URLs . In addition once a page or other resource has been retrieved the client applications may provide access to other pages or records when the user clicks on hyperlinks to other resources. By way of example such hyperlinks may be located within the web pages and provide an automated way for the user to enter the URL of another page and to retrieve that page.

More particularly when a user at a client device desires to view a particular web page hereinafter also referred to as a target structured document hosted by social network environment or a web application hosted by a web application server and made available in conjunction with social network environment the user s web browser or other client side structured document rendering engine or suitable client application formulates and transmits a request to social network environment . The request generally includes a URL or other document identifier as well as metadata or other information. By way of example the request may include information identifying the user such as a user ID as well as information identifying or characterizing the web browser or operating system running on the user s client computing device . The request may also include location information identifying a geographic location of the user s client device or a logical network location of the user s client device as well as timestamp identifying when the request was transmitted.

In an example implementation when a request for a web page or structured document hosted by social network environment is received by the social network environment one or more page generating processes in executing is within the social network environment typically generate a base web page in the form of a Hyper Text Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML or other web browser supported structured document. The generated structured document is then transmitted in a response which may comprise one or more portions or partial responses to the requesting client via a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP or other suitable connection for rendering by the web browser at the client device . The structured document may include one or more resources e.g. JavaScript scripts code segments or resources Cascading Style Sheet CSS code segments or resources image data or resources video data or resources etc. or references to such resources embedded within the transmitted document. By way of example a resource embedded in an HTML document may generally be included or specified within a script element image element or object element among others depending on the type of resource. The element referencing or specifying the resource may include a source attribute e.g. src identifying a location of the resource which may be within a server or data store within social network environment or at one or more external locations to the client device requesting the web page. Typically upon receipt of the response the web browser or other client document rendering application running at the client device then constructs a document object model DOM representation of the received structured document and requests the resource s which may be at one or more other external locations embedded in the document.

In an example implementation when a registered user of social network environment first requests a web page from social network environment in a given user session the response transmitted to the user s client device from social network environment may include a structured document generated by page generating process for rendering a login page at the client device. The user may then enter his or her user login credentials e.g. user ID and password which are then transmitted from the user s client device to social network environment . Upon successful authentication of the user social network environment may then transmit a response to the user s web browser at the user s client device that includes a structured document generated by page generating process for rendering a user homepage or user profile page at the user s client device. Furthermore in particular embodiments and as will be described below this or a subsequent response may further include one or more executable code segments e.g. JavaScript that when received by the user s client device implement a front end client side typeahead process that executes in conjunction with the user s web browser .

In one example embodiment social network environment comprises computing systems that allow users at client devices to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content such as user profiles as described herein. Social network environment is a network addressable system that in various example embodiments comprises one or more physical servers or hereinafter also referred to collectively as servers as well as one or more data stores collectively referred to herein as data store which may be implemented in or by one or more of a variety of consolidated or distributed computing systems databases or data servers as illustrated in . The one or more physical servers are operably connected to computer network via by way of example a set of routers or networking switches . In an example embodiment the functionality hosted by the one or more physical servers may include web or HTTP servers FTP servers as well as without limitation web pages and applications implemented using Common Gateway Interface CGI script PHP Hyper text Preprocessor PHP Active Server Pages ASP Hyper Text Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML Java JavaScript Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX and the like.

Physical servers may host functionality directed to the operations of social network environment . By way of example social network environment may host a website that allows one or more users at one or more client devices to view and post information as well as communicate with one another via the website. Hereinafter servers may be referred to as server although as just described server may include numerous servers hosting for example social network environment as well as other content distribution servers data stores or databases. Data store may store content and data relating to and enabling operation of the social network environment as digital data objects including content objects. A data object in a particular implementation is an item of digital information typically stored or embodied in a data file database or record. Content objects may take many forms including text e.g. ASCII SGML HTML images e.g. jpeg tif and gif graphics vector based or bitmap audio video e.g. mpeg or other multimedia and combinations thereof. Content object data may also include executable code objects e.g. games executable within a browser window or frame podcasts etc. Logically data store corresponds to one or more of a variety of separate or integrated databases such as relational databases and object oriented databases that maintain information as an integrated collection of logically related records or files stored on one or more physical systems. Structurally data store may generally include one or more of a large class of data storage and management systems. In particular embodiments data store may be implemented by any suitable physical system s including components such as one or more database servers mass storage media media library systems storage area networks data storage clouds and the like. In one example embodiment data store includes one or more servers databases e.g. MySQL and or data warehouses.

Data store may include data associated with different social network environment users client devices web application servers or enterprise servers as well as in particular embodiments data associated with various concepts. As described above particular embodiments relate to a social network environment that includes a platform enabling an integrated social network environment. In the following example embodiments the social network environment may be described or implemented in terms of a social graph including social graph information. In particular embodiments data store includes a social graph database in which the social graph information for use in implementing the social network environment described herein is stored. In particular embodiments the social graph information stored by social network environment in data store and particularly in social graph database includes a plurality of nodes and a plurality of edges that define connections between corresponding nodes. In particular embodiments the nodes or edges themselves are data objects that include the identifiers attributes and information including the information is for their corresponding profile pages for their corresponding users or concepts as described below some of which is actually rendered on corresponding profile or other pages. The nodes may also include pointers or references to other objects data structures or resources for use in rendering content in conjunction with the rendering of the profile pages corresponding to the respective nodes.

In general there are various mechanisms available to members to communicate with each other or to obtain information that they find interesting such as activities that their friends are involved with applications that their friends are installing comments made by friends on activities of other friends etc. The mechanisms of communication between members are called channels available as resources. A channel is a computer mediated communication mechanism for facilitating communication between users of the social network and the social network. As illustrated in the following channels are available to users of a social networking website in one embodiment Invitation Channel An invitation is a message sent by a member inviting another member to do something e.g. a member can invite his friend to install an application. Notification Channel A notification is a message informing a member that some activity involving the member has occurred on the social network. Email Channel Members can communicate by emails. Wall Post Channel A wall is an application that allows members to write interesting information to be shared between friends. A message written to a member s wall is called a wall post. A member can post on his own wall as well as walls of the member s friends. Any friend of a member can see what is written on his wall. Newsfeed Channel newsfeed is a constantly updated list of activities done by friends of a member. Such activities include adding applications commenting on photos making new friends etc. Mini feed Channel The mini feed of a member is a list of actions taken by that member. For example the member may have added new friends to his social network or installed certain applications. All such activities of a member are listed in the mini feed of that member.

In addition to interactions with other members the social networking website provides members with the ability to take actions on various types of items supported by the website. These items may include groups or networks where networks here refer is not to physical communication networks but rather to social networks of people to which members of the website may belong events or calendar entries in which a member might be interested computer based applications that a member may use via the website and transactions that allow members to buy sell auction rent or exchange items via the website. These are just a few examples of the items upon which a member may act on a social networking website and many others are possible.

As illustrated in the social networking website maintains a number of objects for the different kinds of items with which a member may interact on the website . In one example embodiment these objects include member profiles group objects event objects application objects respectively hereinafter groups events and applications . In one embodiment an object is stored by the website for each instance of its associated item. For example a member profile is stored for each member who joins the website a group is stored for each group defined in the website and so on. The types of objects and the data stored for each is described in more detail below in connection with .

The member of the website may take specific actions on the website where each action is associated with one or more objects. The types of actions that a member may perform in connection with an object is defined for each object and largely depends on the type of item represented by the object. A particular action may be associated with multiple objects. Described below are a number of examples of particular types of objects that may be defined for the social networking website as well as a number of actions that can be taken for each object. These objects and the actions discussed herein are provided for illustration purposes only and it can be appreciated that an unlimited number of variations and features can be provided on a social networking website .

The social networking website maintains a member profile for each member of the website . Any action that a particular member takes with respect to another member is associated with each member s profile through information maintained in a database or other data repository such as the action log . Such actions is may include for example adding a connection to the other member sending a message to the other member reading a message from the other member viewing content associated with the other member attending an event posted by another member among others. In addition a number of actions described below in connection with other objects are directed at particular members so these actions are associated with those members as well.

A group may be defined for a group or network of members. For example a member may define a group to be a fan club for a particular band. The website would maintain a group for that fan club which might include information about the band media content e.g. songs or music videos by the band and discussion boards on which members of the group can comment about the band. Accordingly member actions that are possible with respect to a group might include joining the group viewing the content listening to songs watching videos and posting a message on the discussion board.

Similarly an event may be defined for a particular event such as a birthday party. A member may create the event by defining information about the event such as the time and place and a list of invitees. Other members may accept the invitation comment about the event post their own content e.g. pictures from the event and perform any other actions enabled by the website for the event . Accordingly the creator of the event as well as the invitees for the event may perform various actions that are associated with that event .

The social networking website also enables members to add applications to their profiles. These applications provide enhanced content and interactivity within the social networking website which maintains an application object for each application hosted in the system. The applications may be provided by the website operator and or by third party developers. An example application is an enhanced messaging service in which members can send virtual objects such as a gift or flowers and an optional message to another member. The use of any functionality is offered by the application may thus constitute an action by the member in connection with the application . In addition continuing the example from above the receipt of the virtual gift or message may also be considered an action in connection with the application . It can therefore be appreciated that actions may be passive and need not require active participation by a member. The scope and type of applications provided is limited only by the imagination and creativity of the application developers. Applications are generally written as server side code that is run on servers of the social networking website an application may also use client side code as appropriate. Generally when a user logs into the site the system determines which applications the user has installed e.g. registered for and then loads and runs such applications in combination with the underlying functionality of the social networking website.

As illustrated in each member can select which applications to install and run. For example application A1 is installed by member M1 and member M3 but not by member M2 . Social networking websites that allow third party developers to develop applications provide a platform for developing new applications. The platform generally includes an application programming interface API by which applications can request various types of functions from the social network website such as information pertaining to a user e.g. information about a user s profile or a user s friends as well as functions for accessing the channel resources . The availability of a large number of applications is beneficial for such a social networking website because users are likely to visit the website repeatedly to make use of the functionality provided by the applications. A member can choose to uninstall an application installed by the member at any time.

In relation to is a high level block diagram illustrating a system environment suitable for operation of a social networking website . The system environment comprises one or more client devices a social networking website and a network . In alternative configurations different and or additional modules can be included in the system.

The client devices comprise one or more computing devices that can receive member input and can transmit and receive data via the network . For example the is client devices may be desktop computers laptop computers smart phones personal digital assistants PDAs or any other device including computing functionality and data communication capabilities. The client devices are configured to communicate via network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and wireless communication systems.

The social networking website comprises a computing system that allows members to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content as described herein. The social networking website stores member profiles that describe the members of a social network including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history hobbies or preferences location and the like. The website further stores data describing one or more relationships between different members. The relationship information may indicate members who have similar or common work experience group memberships hobbies or educational history. Additionally the social network host site includes member defined relationships between different members allowing members to specify their relationships with other members. For example these member defined relationships allows members to generate relationships with other members that parallel the members real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Members may select from predefined types of relationships or define their own relationship types as needed.

The web server links the social networking website via the network to one or more client devices the web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java Flash XML and so forth. The web server may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking website and the client devices . The messages can be instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS messages or any other suitable messaging technique.

The action logger is capable of receiving communications from the web server about member actions on and or off the social networking website . The action logger populates the action log with information about member actions to track them. The newsfeed generator generates messages for each member about information that may be relevant to the member based on actions stored in the action log . These messages are called stories each story is an message comprising one or a few lines of information based on one more actions in the action log that are relevant to the particular member. The stories are presented to a member via one or more pages of the social networking website for example in each member s home page or newsfeed page as shown in . The mini feed generator generates messages for each member about actions done by that member. Similar to newsfeed communications these communications are also stories but mini feed stories of a member are based only on actions done by that member. The channel resource manager allocates channel resources to different applications. The invitation manager controls how many invitations an application is allowed to send. The email generator generates emails for members based on activities associated with the member s friends. For example the use of a specific application by the member s friend may cause an email to be sent to the member. The notification generator generates notification messages for a member informing the member about activities that happened on the social networking website related to that member. For example a notification may inform a member that a friend is posted a message on the member s wall. The wall post generator generates wall post messages for members. For example a message about a new application being available may be posted on a member s wall.

As discussed above the social networking website maintains data about a number of different types of objects with which a member may interact on the website . To this end each of the member profile store application data store the group store the event store and the content store stores instances of the corresponding type of object maintained by the website . Each object type has information fields that are suitable for the storing information appropriate to the type of object. For example the event store contains data structures that include the time and location for an event whereas the member profile store contains data structures with fields suitable for describing a member s profile. When a new object of a particular type is created the website initializes a new data structure of the corresponding type assigns a unique object identifier to it and begins to add data to the object as needed. This might occur for example when a member defines a new event wherein the website would generate a new instance of an event in the event store assign a unique identifier to the event and begin to populate the fields of the event with information provided by the member.

As noted above online social media websites often allow users to like or share content such as user generated content social events random chatter or brand sponsored material such as products sales etc. Users are also allowed to follow various pages such as friends or brands and may post content on their walls. What is currently lacking in such a model however is an intelligent mechanism to track and promote advocacy among users particularly with regard to brands products companies businesses movies sports teams events etc. . For instance though a high percentage of a brand s fans consider themselves brand advocates in actuality only a small percentage are truly advocating or promoting the brand beyond merely liking its social media page.

The techniques herein provide an online community advocacy management is platform that helps brands or users in general to identify the advocates within their fan base that promote the brand to their friends and with other brand enthusiasts. In particular the techniques herein engage these advocates by letting them create vote and share rich content e.g. ideas and stories about a particular brand with other advocates or fans as well as within their own social networks. For example brands or the advocates themselves can create engaging topics that brand fans and their friends can interact with either directly on the social media website or else in a brand specific app thereby creating a brand community. Through their actions advocates are given the credit for their advocacy by building permanent reputations within the brand s fan community giving these advocates a reason to continue promoting the brand thus exposing the brand to their social network as a trusted source. That is fans advocates build permanent identities based on their contributions level up as their reputations grow and foster great peer relationships within the brand community making the brand community a worthwhile user experience.

Moreover the techniques herein provide brand administrators intelligent insights into the content as well as the top advocates that drive conversation about the brand. For instance the techniques herein gauge enthusiasm and fan to friend influence happening within the fan communities. For example the techniques herein manage an overall advocate retention score for each user based on advocacy interaction in terms of volume frequency and or value which may gauge whether the users will re engage in the future. Advantageously knowing that a core minority drive almost all communities the behavior of these superfans is a very predictive indicator on performance of a community to influence behavior of fans as well as friends of fans.

According to one or more embodiments described herein within an online social community e.g. FACEBOOK MYSPACE etc. brands e.g. companies businesses sports teams etc. are provided with tools to connect with users e.g. advocates audience customers in a manner that allows them to evaluate and promote content generated by or in collaboration with users based on buzz . The techniques herein is implemented as an app tab or plug in to a social media site provide user interface and back end mechanisms to identify people over time in a community up not content down manner that weights current actions based on the accumulated value of past actions of all involved users such as by granting users levels of advocacy points badges for creating or curating content e.g. brand plugs or other content that drive response and action from the audience with immediate social validation. Value is measured algorithmically based on the first and second tier activities driven by a user action. In this manner the techniques herein provide the capability to tie actions to users across time and to understand their historic influence likely future influence while providing incentives that drive users to become influential advocates.

In general those skilled in the art will readily understand the basic concept of an online community and how the online community may be a side page or app e.g. fan page controlled or offered by the advocacy management platform that executes within a social media environment e.g. FACEBOOK or else as the social media environment itself e.g. an independent website . In some cases the users may simply access the online community within a social media environment or may be required to allow an app to execute on their local machines computer laptop phone tablet etc. in order to access the community . In other words wherein the platform itself may refer to an application within a social media website a plug in for a social media website a feature of a social media website a tab of a social media website the actual social media website a program offered to brands for use within a social media website etc.

Accordingly the online community advocacy management platform may generally provide a forum for user generated content which may be a topic specific social media wall and or a personal user centric social media wall. Note that the forum may also be brand specific or may be a more generic forum allowing cross brand discussion e.g. a rock climbing forum an auto enthusiast forum etc. . The forum may be used to present various administrator created topics that specifically solicit user generated content such as questions topics subjects etc. e.g. what s your favorite memory of the brand or who should win this year s most valuable player award .

Once a user has opted to view a particular subject current or previous they may be brought to a subject specific user interface as shown in which illustrates an example user interface relating to a specific topic in an online community advocacy management platform. Specifically a banner which may be the same as banner may be presented to the user to continue to identify with the brand or online community in general. The selected subject may again be presented with the number of ideas the synopsis which may though need not be the same as synopsis and an option to create a new idea . Illustratively below the subject listing a participant may find a listing of the user generated content such as specific ideas e.g. the steak tip dinner is my favorite dish presented by identified users e.g. a user name a handle a user ID an avatar etc. having an associated level described herein. The author users may also provide a string of idea text e.g. I ask for it medium rare and with extra sauce. Can t beat it associated with their idea and participants may see or contribute to comments e.g. by clicking link or may simply like link or share link the content as will be understood in the art. Note that the participants may also vote on the idea link buttons which is another mechanism that may help a brand and the author gauge community response to the user generated idea .

In particular the techniques herein may be used to determine a community response to a particular user generated content in a forum such as based on follow on social input e.g. comments links votes followers shares etc. associated with the particular user generated content. From the community response the techniques herein may thus evaluate an influence of the particular user generated content or else provide metrics for administrator evaluation of the content as described herein. Note that the social input may also consider first and second tier responses where a first tier response is associated with the user generated content e.g. a comment or a share by a first user of the original idea and a second tier response is associated with the first tier responses e.g. a comment or like by a second user of the first user s comment or share .

Specifically the online community advocacy management platform herein may be configured to provide cross platform content management where the techniques herein e.g. application programming interfaces APIs pull and or push comments in from the app plug in and cross pollinate the social online community e.g. social network website walls and app plug in content in an intelligent manner which content how often etc. . For instance social media environments websites e.g. hosting the personal user centric social media wall often provide tools for API integration such as FACEBOOK s Open Graph API from which the platform herein may access raw social media data get content query data etc. aggregate it and intelligently distil the data for use with the techniques herein.

In particular according to one or more embodiments herein the online community advocacy management platform may maintain a topic specific social media wall e.g. interface within an online community and may detect a correlation for a user generated post between the topic specific social media wall and a personal user centric social media wall. For instance the platform may detect determine that a particular user e.g. user1 participates in both the online community and also has a personal user centric social media wall . As such in one embodiment the user may post user generated content within the online community e.g. Idea Title 1 by user1 in and that post may be pulled from the online community page to is the user centric social media wall e.g. post and or content entered into the user s wall and or profile . Alternatively or in addition in another embodiment the user may post user generated content on the personal user centric social media wall and the techniques herein push the content e.g. post content to the online community.

In either situation above the techniques herein also notably pull or push social input related to the user generated post between the topic specific social media wall and the personal user centric social media wall as described herein. In particular at least when pulling social input e.g. likes comments votes shares flags etc. related to the user generated post from the personal user centric social media wall into the topic specific social media wall the techniques herein may select particular social input and may do so at a determined rate. For instance the techniques herein may select the selected social input as social input from participants registered with the online community or as social input from participants having a user advocacy score described herein within the online community that is greater than a minimum threshold. Further the techniques herein may provide for a manual moderation queue where an administrator or user with a sufficient advocate level described herein may moderate and approve the cross pollination of the content. Alternatively or in addition the techniques may selectively pull or push content and or social input based on buzz such as pulling content that has been liked or shared a sufficient number of times or voted highly or greatly commented upon etc. such that content with a sufficient level of first tier social input or first tier social input with a sufficient level of secondary tier input may be selected for cross pollination.

In certain embodiments the rate at which content is cross pollinated pulled and or pushed may be a default time e.g. generally instantaneous once an hour once a day etc. or may be a dynamically determined rate. For instance the rate may be determined as a default initial rate e.g. every ten minutes and then decayed to a longer rate over time e.g. gradually increasing over 4 5 days to infinity to stop pulling social input . Note that in certain specific embodiments the rate may be additionally or separately be determined as a function of community interest in the user generated content such as basing the rate on the number or rate or both of followers likes comments votes shares flags etc. For example an active subject may continue to be active for many days where such activity may be judged by continued interest and newly generated content.

Referring again to the user interfaces illustrates an example user interface relating to a user s wall in an online community advocacy management platform for instance a public wall that may be viewed by another participant or the user his or herself such as when clicking on the user s name in any of the other interfaces pages above. Note that the page may be used for both registered users as well as non registered participants users associated with a ghost profile as described below e.g. as a uniquely identified anonymous user. Illustratively page may comprise a banner tying the profile to the online community while a substantial remainder of the page is dedicated to the particular user User X and their status reputation and contribution to the online community. For example the user name may be associated with a number of points and a level each described below. Participants viewing the page wall may also be given the option to follow button link the given User X as may be appreciated by those skilled in the art.

Various views options may be presented such as the ability to see a number of followers participants following User X and their ideas tab a number of users that User X is following and their ideas tab a number of ideas and a number of active ideas tab illustratively selected and shown and a number of badges or achievements tab . Clicking any of the above mentioned tabs may direct the participant to a listing of the followers users being followed their respective ideas the types of badges achievements e.g. User X s profile as discussed in below etc. As shown in when the active ideas tab is selected a participant may be shown one or more of User X s ideas with an illustrative layout similar to the subject topic pages described above though generally limited to ideas or other content sourced by User X. In addition User X s activity feed may also be collected and shown within the interface such as indicating actions performed by User X achievements reached actions by other users with regard to User X etc.

As mentioned above the techniques herein also provide advocacy retention is scoring or other achievement based award system for the online community advocacy management platform. In particular in one or more embodiments herein an advocacy retention score may be established to foster elite advocates by providing incentives for engaging in brand generated communications such as the creation of comments and creating peer to peer and reputation based relationships specific to the context of that brand community. Various techniques are presented to define levels and badges milestones to allow users to maintain an advocate reputation based on participation and community response.

In particular various activities may be associated with a certain number of correspondingly valuable points to award to the users according to their community participation. For instance small activity such as clicking like might be associated with a smaller number of points while large activity such as posting a new idea might be associated with a correspondingly larger number of points. In general the point system for the advocacy score may be established unilaterally by the advocacy management platform or else by brands themselves for brand specific online communities .

Specifically the online community advocacy management platform may determine participation of a user in an online community based on user activity and also a community response to the user activity. Based on values associated with particular user activities and particular community responses as mentioned above a user advocacy score for the particular user that sourced the particular user generated content may be adjusted within the online community. For example an illustrative score generally weighs the rest of the community s response to a user s actions rather than or in addition to the quantity of a user s action e.g. creating a comment earns significantly less reputation than five other people liking or up voting or otherwise endorsing a comment . Favorable downstream reactions to a user s action purchase or convert sign up increased frequency of engagement within community etc. may also be weighed. Note that the advocacy score may be adjusted based on an aggregate of historical influence of the particular user which generally correlates to increasing the advocacy score in response to positive community response. However in one or more embodiments the advocacy score may actually be decreased in response to a negative community response if so desired by system administrators.

The advocacy score of the users may then be provided to the particular user community participants community members and administrators specifically soliciting content on the forum whether in report form or more preferably within the online community pages as described herein. In this manner the techniques herein allow users to build their identity within the community e.g. becoming the brand s 1 fan or a top advocate and allows the brands themselves to better track who are their best advocates which advocates come back repeatedly which ones return less frequently or not at all e.g. one hit wonders through the reputation and persistent ID of the users based on participation and community response.

In addition to further foster elite advocates the techniques herein provide mechanisms for additional incentives for user generated content such as defining a plurality of advocacy milestones for users and providing recognition awards to the users in response to their reaching each advocacy milestone. For instance the online community advocacy management platform or else brand administrators may establish a plurality of score based level thresholds such that a level of a particular user increases within the online community each time the advocacy score of that particular user crosses one of the score based level thresholds. For example the score based level thresholds may be incrementally set e.g. every 1000 points or may be increasingly distant at each sequentially reached threshold e.g. 1000 2500 7500 15000 50000 etc. . Note also that the score itself may be the same across all levels e.g. 100 points for a new idea or else may be incrementally adjusted based on level e.g. 100 points for a new idea by a level 1 user and 1000 points for a new idea by a level 10 user etc. . Moreover the user advocacy scores may be maintained on a per brand basis e.g. within a specific brand s online community or else on a cross brand basis e.g. within a broader online community in which many brands may participate .

In addition a set of achievement criteria may be defined determined within the online community such that users may receive be associated with an achievement award in response to meeting the corresponding achievement criteria. Example is achievement criteria may be things such as advocacy scores topics presented posts comments likes followers followings likers users who like material by the user commenters users who commented on material by the user top rankings trending topics shares flags etc. The achievement criteria and awards may be defined by brand administrators and or may be generic to all brands within the online community. Also awards may be token gestures of appreciation such as badges e.g. honors medals etc. within the online community or else may be associated with particular physical awards such as gift cards hats etc. Generally the advocacy scoring and associated awards need not be set forth as a competition to win materials but may be a way in which brands may determine particular users that are providing a level of advocacy that they would like to commend such as with interesting prizes or gifts e.g. invites to unveilings track days for auto manufacturers etc. . In other words the score and awards may simply provide a way for brands to know who to thank when they are looking to thank someone for their continued advocacy.

Note that many people are reluctant to provide personal information to an online social network. The reasons for this reluctance are varied. Some have experienced undesired communications spam when submitting personal information online while others fear identity theft. Still other people simply may know that they can register for something or have not yet decided whether to register. At times however it would still be useful for brands to be able to track these unregistered users particularly if they are providing valuable user generated content. Accordingly the techniques herein may also create ghost profiles of users not registered with the app plug in but that are participating in the social media forum to identify such non registered users in a useful manner. In this manner all participants may build their advocacy score regardless of the app plug in which may be useful for the user if later deciding to participate officially or else for the brand to continue to be able to monitor anonymous yet uniquely identified activity on an individual basis and to identify quantify and foster the most valuable and influential advocates within the existing community. Note that this embodiment is also particularly useful for where a registered user has posted user generated content and a non registered user friend posts content likes comments etc. on the originally posted content.

Specifically according to one or more embodiments herein the online community advocacy management platform may determine user generated activity within an online community as described above though now identifies the activity as being from a non registered participant. In general the user generated activity may entail comments likes sourced topics sourced ideas followers shares flags etc. just as for registered users above. Here however the platform also determines available identification ID information of the non registered participant such as a user name within the online community a handle an IP address an email address etc. If the ID is associated with a pre existing ghost profile then the user generated activity by the non registered user may be logged within the associated ghost profile generally similar to a registered profile above. In response to there being no associated ghost profile therefore the platform may create a ghost profile for the non registered participant thus providing a log of user generated activity by a corresponding non registered user based on the ID.

Certain differences between a conventional profile and a ghost profile may exist in one or more preferred embodiments described herein. For instance a ghost profile of a particular non registered user may be associated with limitations on advocacy score level and or achievements. In addition the non registered user may be identified to brand administrators as a uniquely identifiable anonymous user without indicating the ID thus not exposing personal information such as a user name or a full user name location IP address etc. Access may be provided to the ghost profile for only the administrators of the online community or else also to the non registered users themselves. In a specific embodiment access to the ghost profile may also be provided for participants of the online community again where the non registered user is identified to the participants as a uniquely identifiable anonymous user without indicating the ID . Note that within an individual community thread where the user generated activity took place the actual non registered user s ID may be displayed with the user generated content such as posting the user name on the online social media website in a conventional manner. In the event that this material is pulled copied to other locations such as for brand specific walls reporting purposes etc. then where that user generated content is displayed the non registered user may be displayed with an anonymous ID.

In the event the non registered user register eventually registers with the online community or with the brand specific app then according to one or more embodiments herein the user may be converted to a registered user and a newly established registered profile of the registered user may be populated with logged activity from the associated ghost profile accordingly e.g. without the limitations mentioned above .

With regard to administrator control the techniques herein also provide for contribution filtering for the online community advocacy management platform. In particular for the platform the techniques herein intelligently provide mechanisms and user interfaces for filtering triaging the view of comments and content based on advocate levels trend rates consumer participation hot topics recent activity etc. by is gauging the likelihood of user generated actions to cause future influence based on their algorithmic similarities to historically influential actions and weighted based on an aggregate compounding history of individuals throughout time.

In particular according to the techniques herein an online community advocacy management platform may determine aggregate attributes of historically influential user generated actions within an online community such as one or more user based or content based aggregate attributes. Example user based attributes comprise such things as a user advocacy score a user advocacy level user achievements a number of followers of the user a number of likes of the user etc. On the other hand example content based attributes comprise a trend rate of the content consumer participation in the content a ranking of the content a classification of the content as recent a number of followers of the content a number of likes of the content a number of links to the content a number of shares of the content a number of votes for the content etc. The techniques herein may thus correspondingly determine aggregate attributes of historically influential user generated actions by compounding the history of aggregate attributes of individual user generated actions that resulted in historically significant community participation.

Based on the aggregate attributes of the historically influential user generated actions the techniques herein may thus gauge the likelihood of particular user generated actions to cause future influence based on algorithmic similarities in their aggregate attributes to the historically influential user generated actions. Via the GUI the platform may then present the particular user generated actions in a format reflective of the gauged likelihood of those particular user generated actions to cause future influence. For example if it is determined that users with high scores high levels and a high number of followers generally create a considerable community response then the GUI may rank users according to their score level and number of followers in an aggregated manner. In addition the GUI may be configured to display content e.g. posts ideas etc. from those users to indicate which posts might garner substantial attention in the future e.g. in order to watch the subject more closely or else to provide further brand based content within the user generated content . As another example certain users in the past may have generated subjects topics that had a proportionally high degree of consumer participation and or customer follow up e.g. clicking on the brand s primary website link . As such these users or current posts of these users may be presented in an up front manner within the administrator GUI accordingly. Notably in a specific embodiment the platform may accept input within the GUI to select particular aggregate attributes for use with determining algorithmic similarities e.g. score only or level and score or level and achievements or number of followers score and number of shared posts etc. .

In accordance with one or more additional embodiments described herein the online community advocacy management platform may also be configured to provide customer reward correlation where an advocate score can be tied to a particular customer reward number for the associated brand thus correlating advocates to customers. In this manner awards may be triggered by the brand based on the advocate score an aggregate of action over time through a client facing API e.g. a better advocate for an airline may receive frequent flyer miles .

The advocacy management platform in this embodiment is configured to associate the advocacy score user metrics with a customer reward number of the particular brand. For example various brands e.g. particular online communities or else particular brand specific subjects within an online community may offer a customer reward system that gives out membership points frequent flier miles travel miles hotel points discount points reward points brand based currency etc. In order to track the customer rewards the brands associate each customer with a reward number that uniquely identifies the particular customer. According to this embodiment the advocacy management platform may request e.g. during registration or at a later time that the online community member enter their corresponding customer reward number.

Once the association between the online community member and the customer reward number has taken place the advocacy management platform may provide a representation of the associated advocacy score to the customer reward system of the particular brand brand and user rewards such as via an application programming interface API into the online community advocacy management platform for the brand administrators. Note that the advocacy score directly may be used as the representation such that the customer reward system converts the provided advocacy score into its own system of customer reward points. However in one or more embodiments the advocacy management platform may be configured to determine the actual customer reward points based on a conversion from the advocacy score and thus provides the customer reward points as the representation.

Note also that the advocacy management platform may provide the representation in response to requests from the customer reward system brand or else may trigger the providing pushing of the representation based on the advocacy score such as in response to certain scoring milestones level ups badges achievements etc. Additionally the users customers themselves may directly interface with the customer reward system brand to either redeem reward points or to cause the initial correlation between their online community ID and their customer reward number.

The following illustrate example simplified procedures that generally recapitulate the concepts described above. The procedures in below however are not meant to be limiting to the scope of the disclosure and are merely examples of generalized implementations of the techniques described herein.

In particular illustrates an example simplified procedure for an online community advocacy management platform in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. The procedure may start at step and continues to step where as described in greater detail above an online community advocacy management platform provides a forum e.g. one or more websites or walls for user generated content such as by presenting administrator created topics. The platform generally determines a community response to a particular user generated content in the forum in step based on follow on social input associated with the particular user generated content and in step may evaluate an influence of the particular user generated content based on the community response. Accordingly in step the platform correspondingly adjusts e.g. increases or decreases an advocacy score of a particular user that sourced the particular user generated content based on an aggregate of historical influence of the particular user. Note that as described above this advocacy score may include or otherwise be associated with various recognition awards provided to the users in response to their reaching advocacy milestones. The advocacy score may then be provided in step in a manner as described herein such as to at least one of the particular user community participants community members and is administrators specifically soliciting content on the forum. The example simplified procedure ends in step notably with the option to return to any suitable step described above to continue managing advocacy within the online community.

In addition illustrates an example simplified procedure for advocacy retention scoring for an online community advocacy management platform in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. The procedure may start at step and continues to step where as described in greater detail above the online community advocacy management platform determines participation of a user in an online community based on user activity and then in step determines a community response to the user activity. Based on values associated with particular user activities and particular community responses as described in greater detail above in step the platform may correspondingly increase a user advocacy score e.g. per brand or cross brand for the user within the online community. Each time the advocacy score of a particular user crosses an established score based level thresholds then in step the platform may increase a level of that particular user within the online community. Note that also as mentioned above in step the platform may associate a particular user with an achievement award in response to the particular user meeting a corresponding achievement criteria. The procedure illustratively ends in step though with the ability to continue managing advocacy at any appropriate step described above.

Moreover illustrates an example simplified procedure for cross platform content management for an online community advocacy management platform in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. The procedure may start at step and continues to step where as described in greater detail above the online community advocacy management platform maintains a topic specific social media wall within an online community and is configured to detect a correlation for a user generated post between the topic specific social media wall and a personal user centric social media wall in step . As described above in step the platform pulls selected social input related to the user generated post from the personal user centric social media wall into the topic specific social media wall at a determined rate. Specifically as noted above the selection of particular social input may be manually moderated response based or user based. Further the determined rate may be a decaying rate and or may be determined as a function of community interest. Optionally as mentioned above selected social input related to the user generated post may also or alternatively be pushed from the topic specific social media wall into the personal user centric social media wall in step . The simplified procedure illustratively ends in step though notably still with the ability to continue managing the advocacy within the online community accordingly.

Continuing further illustrates an example simplified procedure for contribution filtering for an online community advocacy management platform in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. The procedure may start at step and continues to step where as described in greater detail above the online community advocacy management platform determines aggregate attributes of historically influential user generated actions within an online community. As such the platform may gauge likelihood of particular user generated actions to cause future influence in step based on algorithmic similarities in their aggregate attributes to the historically influential user generated actions e.g. accepting particular similarities to use as mentioned above . As such in step the platform may present the particular user generated actions in a GUI format reflective of the gauged likelihood of those particular user generated actions to cause future influence and the simplified procedure ends in step where it may restart at any suitable step mentioned above to continue filtering contribution in an intelligently provided GUI format according to the techniques described herein.

Furthermore illustrates an example simplified procedure for populating ghost identities for an online community advocacy management platform in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. The procedure may start at step and continues to step where as described in greater detail above the online community advocacy management platform determines user generated activity within an online community by a non registered participant. In response in step the platform determines available ID information of the non registered participant and determines in step whether the non registered participant has a ghost profile for the is online community based on the ID. If there is no ghost profile in step then in step the platform may create a ghost profile for the non registered participant where a ghost profile provides a log of user generated activity by a corresponding non registered user based on the ID as described above. In step having determined an existing profile or creating a new one the platform logs the user generated activity by the non registered user within the associated ghost profile and provides access to the profile in one of the manners described above e.g. user only administrator only etc. . Optionally in step the non registered user may be registered to a registered user at which time the platform may populate a registered profile of the newly registered user with logged activity from the associated ghost profile. The procedure illustratively ends in step though additional logged activity may be entered for non registered users accordingly.

Lastly illustrates an example simplified procedure for customer reward correlation for an online community advocacy management platform in accordance with one or more embodiments described herein. The procedure may start at step and continues to step where as described in greater detail above the online community advocacy management platform determines an advocacy score for a user within an online community which as detailed above may generally represent an aggregate of actions by the user over time with regard to a particular brand. Accordingly in step the platform may associate the advocacy score with a customer reward number of the particular brand and in step provides a representation of the associated advocacy score to a customer reward system of the particular brand. Note that as detailed above the platform may either first convert the advocacy score to customer reward points or else may simply provide the score itself or some other measure thereof . The simplified procedure may then illustratively end in step .
