This application is a National Stage Entry of International Application No. PCT JP2012 006855 filed Oct. 25 2012 which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 014020 filed Jan. 26 2012. The entire contents of the above referenced applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.

3GPP 3rd Generation Partnership Project specifications define the function for reducing location registration procedures when a mobile station makes reselection between different RANs Radio Access Networks provided by different RATs Radio Access Technologies . This function is referred to as ISR Idle mode Signalling Reduction .

RAN covers a geographical area divided into a plurality of cells or sectors. Each cell or sector is provided by a base station. Specific examples of RAN include UTRAN Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network GERAN GSM EDGE Radio Access Network and E UTRAN Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network . A base station is referred to as NodeB BTS Base Transceiver Station or eNodeB for example. Further a mobile station is referred to as UE User Equipment or MS Mobile Station for example.

The term RAT is used as synonymous with RAN in some cases however it is a concept that includes not only RAN but also a mobility management node or entity placed in a core network in general. Specific examples of RAT include UTRA Universal Terrestrial Radio Access and E UTRA Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access . E UTRA is also called LTE Long Term Evolution in some cases. A mobility management node or entity in UTRA is SGSN Serving GPRS Support Node . A mobility management node or entity in E UTRA is MME Mobility Management Entity .

Typically the ISR can reduce signalling of location registration procedures when a mobile station in the idle state makes cell reselection between different RATs. The idle state or idle mode generally means the following state. Specifically in the idle state a mobile station is attached to a core network and both of the mobile station and the mobility management node or entity have MM contexts or MM parameters . However a NAS Non Access Stratum message is not sent and received between the mobile station and the mobility management node and dedicated radio resources in the RAN are not allocated for the mobile station. The core network keeps track of the location of the mobile station in units of location registration area. The location registration area is called RA Routing Area in UTRA and called TA Tracking Area in E UTRA. Note that in E UTRA the mobile station can belong to a plurality of TAs. In this case the mobility management node i.e. MME keeps track of the location of the mobile station in units of TA list. The TA list can contain a plurality of TAs. Specific examples of idle state include ECM EPS Connection Management IDLE state in E UTRAN PMM Packet Mobility Management IDLE state in UTRAN and GPRS STANDBY state in GERAN. Further specific examples of idle state may include at least one of RRC IDLE state in E UTRAN CELL PCH state and URA PCH state in UTRAN and Packet Idle state in GERAN.

When the mobile station frequently makes reselection between different RANs e.g. between E UTRAN and GERAN UTRAN a location registration procedure is executed each time. The location registration procedure is referred to as a location update procedure in some cases. The location registration procedure in E UTRAN is TAU Tracking Area Update . The location registration procedure in GERAN UTRAN is RAU Routing Area Update . The location registration procedure involves signalling between the mobile station and the mobility management node located in the core network and signalling in the core network. Signalling in the core network includes for example signalling between the mobility management node and a subscriber server e.g. HSS Home Subscriber Server HLR Home Location Register . Accordingly frequent location registration procedures cause an increase in network load.

The ISR aims at reducing the location registration procedures caused by reselection between different RANs Radio Access Networks . Currently 3GPP defines ISR for reselection by the mobile station between E UTRAN and GERAN UTRAN. When the ISR is activated the mobile station is registered in both of the two mobility management nodes or entities corresponding to two RANs or RATs . To be specific the mobile station is registered in both of the MME and the SGSN. Further the mobile station has both of the MM Mobility Management contexts received from the SGSN and the MM contexts received from the MME. The MM contexts from the SGSN contain P TMSI Packet Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity and RAI Routing Area Identity for example. The P TMSI is a temporary identifier assigned to the mobile station by the SGSN. The MM contexts from the MME contain GUTI Globally Unique Temporary Identity and TAI Tracking Area Identity for example. The GUTI is a temporary identifier assigned to the mobile station by the MME. When the ISR is activated the mobile station can make reselection between two RANs i.e. GERAN UTRAN and E UTRAN without performing a location registration procedure i.e. RAU TAU unless it moves out of the two location registration areas i.e. RA and TA s registered in the network.

The ISR is activated in the following procedure for example. First the mobile station performs initial attach through either one of two RANs i.e. through GERAN UTRAN or E UTRAN in this example. Here it is considered that the mobile station performs initial attach through E UTRAN. In the initial attach the mobile station performs a location registration procedure with the MME and the mobile station is registered in the MME. The mobile station enters ECM IDLE state.

Next when the mobile station first reselects GERAN UTRAN the mobile station initiates a location registration procedure i.e. RAU . Specifically the mobile station sends a RAU request to the SGSN. The RAU request contains P TMSI mapped from GUTI. The SGSN sends a context request to the MME specified from the received GUTI. The SGSN thereby sends the MM contexts e.g. P TMSI RA of the mobile station managed by itself to the MME and receives the MM contexts e.g. GUTI TA s from the MME. Then the SGSN sends a RAU accept. The RAU accept carries the MM contexts e.g. P TMSI RA and indicates ISR activated .

Upon receiving the RAU accept indicating ISR activated the mobile station activates the ISR in the own station. To be specific the mobile station sets its TIN Temporary Identity used in Next update to RAT related TMSI . The TIN is one of the MM contexts held by the mobile station. The TIN defines the identifier of the mobile station to be presented by the mobile station in the next location registration procedure i.e. RAU request TAU request or attach request. As a result of setting the TIN to RAT related TMSI the ISR operation in the mobile station is started.

For overview of the ISR refer to 4.3.5.6 Idle mode signalling reduction function and Annex J High Level ISR description in Non Patent Literature 1 3GPP TS 23.401 . The ISR is also described in Non Patent Literature 2 3GPP TS 24.301 and Non Patent Literature 3 3GPP TS 24.008 .

Further 3GPP specifications define a plurality of methods such as CS Fallback and IMS Voice Voice over IP to provide a voice service to the mobile station in E UTRA. In relation to this the network e.g. MME can indicate which RAN or RAT is to be selected preferentially when the mobile station that supports the voice service selects a cell. For example UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN that are sent from the mobile station to the network may be used as an index to determine the RAN or RAT to be selected preferentially. The UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN are stored in the mobile station and sent to the mobility management node i.e. MME SGSN by TAU request RAU request and attach request.

The UE s usage setting indicates whether the mobile station behaves in a voice centric or a data centric . The Voice domain preference for E UTRAN indicates whether the mobile station supports CS Circuit Switched voice or PS Packet Switched voice and indicates which one of CS voice and PS voice is more preferred. To be specific the Voice domain preference for E UTRAN indicates the mobile station is configured as CS Voice only CS Voice preferred and IMS PS Voice as secondary IMS PS Voice preferred and CS Voice as secondary or IMS PS Voice only .

For overview of the UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN refer to 4.3.5.9 Voice domain preference and UE s usage setting and 4.3.6 Radio Resource Management functions in Non Patent Literature 1 3GPP TS 23.401 for example. The UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN are also described by Non Patent Literature 2 3GPP TS 24.301 in 3.1 Definitions 4.3 UE mode of operation 5.5.3.2.2 Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure initiation 5.5.3.3.2 Combined tracking area updating procedure initiation and the like. Further they are described also by Non Patent Literature 3 3GPP TS 24.008 in 4.7.5.1 Normal and periodic routing area updating procedure 4.7.5.2.1 Combined routing area updating procedure initiation and the like.

In this specification the term voice service configuration information is defined as information that is related to the priority of a voice service stored in the mobile station and that is sent from the mobile station to the network and used in the network as an index for selecting RAN or RAT which provides a voice service to the mobile station such as the above described UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN .

When the voice service configuration information such as the above described UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN are updated in the mobile station the mobile station performs a location registration procedure with the mobility management node e.g. MME or SGSN corresponding to the currently selected RAN thereby informing the mobility management node about the update of the voice service configuration information. To be specific the mobile station sends a TAU request or a RAN request indicating the update of the voice service configuration information. The mobility management node corresponding to the currently selected RAN can thereby recognize the update of the voice service configuration information.

However the update of the voice service configuration information such as the above described UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN in the mobile station is not used as a trigger for deactivation of the ISR. Accordingly when the ISR is activated the mobile station does not initiate the location registration procedure during reselection of RAN that is performed after the update of the voice service configuration information. Therefore the mobility management node corresponding to the reselected RAN cannot recognize the update of the voice service configuration information. This means that selection of RAN or RAT different from the expectation of the mobile station may occur at the reselected RAN. For example there is a possibility that the mobile station is forced to move to other RAN without conforming to the priority assumed from the updated voice service configuration information.

That is when the voice service configuration information stored in the mobile station is updated when the ISR is activated discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information can arise between mobility management nodes e.g. MME and SGSN where the ISR is activated.

The present invention has been accomplished based on the above described finding by the present inventor and an object of the present invention is thus to provide a mobile station a method for controlling a mobile station a mobile communication system a mobility management apparatus and a program that can contribute to solve the problem of discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information described above.

A first aspect includes a mobile station. The mobile station includes a communication control unit. The communication control unit is capable of performing location registration procedures with first and second mobility management units respectively corresponding to first and second RANs Radio Access Networks and supports ISR Idle mode Signalling Reduction for reducing location registration procedures caused by reselection between the first and second RANs by the mobile station. Further when voice service setting information stored in the mobile station is updated when the ISR is activated the communication control unit deactivates the ISR in the mobile station.

A second aspect includes a method for controlling a mobile station that can be registered in both of first and second mobility management units respectively corresponding to first and second RANs Radio Access Networks and supports ISR Idle mode Signalling Reduction for reducing location registration procedures caused by reselection between the first and second RANs. The method includes when voice service configuration information stored in the mobile station is updated when the ISR is activated deactivating the ISR in the mobile station.

A third aspect includes a mobile communication system. The mobile communication system includes first and second mobility management units respectively corresponding to first and second RANs and a mobile station.

Further the mobile station is configured to deactivate the ISR in the mobile station when voice service configuration information stored in the mobile station is updated when the ISR is activated.

A fourth aspect includes a mobility management apparatus.

According to the above described aspects it is possible to provide a mobile station a method for controlling a mobile station a mobile communication system a mobility management apparatus and a program that can contribute to solve the problem of discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information described above.

Specific embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter in detail with reference to the drawings. It is noted that in the description of the drawings the same elements will be denoted by the same reference symbols and redundant description will be omitted to clarify the explanation.

In the example of the mobile communication system includes a core network and a mobile station . The core network includes an MME and an SGSN . The MME is a mobility management node or entity corresponding to the E UTRAN . The SGSN is a mobility management node or entity corresponding to the GERAN UTRAN . Note that this embodiment mainly describes the control plane functions i.e. mobility management and the ISR for the mobile station . Thus the SGSN of may have the control plane functions only. The MME and the SGSN both support the ISR and can send and receive a context related to the mobile station containing the voice service configuration information received from the mobile station with each other thereby synchronizing the contexts with each other. Signalling for sending and receiving the context may be performed using an interface i.e. S3 Interface available between the MME and the SGSN .

As already indicated above the voice service configuration information is information that is related to the priority of a voice service stored in the mobile station and that is sent from the mobile station to the core network and used in the core network as an index for selecting RAN or RAT which provides a voice service to the mobile station . The voice service configuration information includes for example at least one of the above described UE s usage setting and Voice domain preference for E UTRAN .

Although not shown in the core network may include a transfer node or entity in a user plane as a matter of course. The transfer node or entity performs transfer e.g. routing or forwarding of user data. The core network may include a plurality of transfer nodes or entities . In the case of EPS the transfer node or entity includes an S GW Serving Gateway and a P GW Packet Data Network Gateway . In the case of UMTS the transfer node or entity includes the user plane function of an SGSN and the user plane function of a GGSN Gateway GPRS Support Node . Thus the core network may include an EPC Evolved Packet Core corresponding to LTE and a GPRS General Packet Radio Service packet core for UMTS.

The mobile station is a dual mode terminal that supports a plurality of RATs which are E UTRA and UTRA in this example. In other words the mobile station is capable of establishing a connection to the E UTRAN through LTE wireless access and a connection to the GERAN UTRAN through 2G 3G wireless access. The mobile station in the idle state e.g. ECM IDLE state PMM IDLE state or GPRS STANDBY state can make reselection cell reselection between the E UTRAN and the GERAN UTRAN . When selecting the E UTRAN the mobile station performs TAU procedure as the location registration procedure. On the other hand when selecting the GERAN UTRAN the mobile station performs RAU procedure as the location registration procedure. The TAU procedure includes sending a TAU request from the mobile station to the MME and sending a TAU accept from the MME to the mobile station . On the other hand the RAU procedure includes sending a RAU request from the mobile station to the SGSN and sending a RAU accept from the SGSN to the mobile station .

The mobile station supports the ISR for reducing signalling related to those location registration procedures. Specifically when the ISR is activated after the mobile station is registered in both of the MME and the SGSN the mobile station can make reselection between two RANs i.e. the E UTRAN and the GERAN UTRAN without performing the a location registration procedure i.e. RAU TAU unless it moves out of the two location registration areas i.e. RA and TA s registered in the network.

Note that however the mobile station according to the first embodiment is configured to deactivate the ISR in the mobile station when the voice service configuration information stored in the mobile station is updated when the ISR is activated. The ISR deactivation in the mobile station may be local ISR deactivation in the mobile station . In other words even when an instruction from the network i.e. the MME and the SGSN indicates ISR activated the mobile station may spontaneously and locally deactivate the ISR in the mobile station without depending on the instruction from the network.

The local ISR deactivation in the mobile station is done by changing the TIN Temporary Identity used in Next update from RAT related TMSI to GUTI or P TMSI. Whether the TIN is set to GUTI or P TMSI is determined according to the RAN selected by the mobile station . To be specific when the mobile station selects the E UTRAN the mobile station sets the TIN to GUTI for ISR deactivation. On the other hand when the mobile station selects the GERAN UTRAN the mobile station sets the TIN to P TMSI for ISR deactivation.

Further instead of spontaneous and local ISR deactivation by the mobile station the ISR deactivation in the mobile station caused by updating the voice service configuration information may be performed according to an instruction for deactivation from the MME or the SGSN . This example is described in detail in the second embodiment below.

With the spontaneous and local ISR deactivation by the mobile station there is an advantage that it is possible to solve the problem of discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information without adding new functions to the mobility management nodes or entities on the network side i.e. the MME and the SGSN . The MME and the SGSN only need to perform the normal ISR operation specified in the current 3GPP specifications. On the other hand in the case of performing ISR deactivation in the mobile station according to an instruction for deactivation from the MME or the SGSN there is an advantage that it is possible to solve the problem of discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information without adding new functions to the mobile station . The mobile station only needs to deactivate the ISR state of itself in accordance with the normal ISR operation specified in the current 3GPP specifications.

The ISR deactivation in the mobile station causes the mobile station to perform the location registration procedure i.e. TAU or RAU with one of the MME and the SGSN corresponding to a RAN to which the mobile station moves during reselection of RAN that is performed after the update of the voice service configuration information. This is because as a result that the ISR is deactivated the mobile station cannot skip the location registration procedure and has to perform the location registration procedure i.e. TAU or RAU with one of the MME and the SGSN corresponding to the reselected RAN to which the mobile stations moves.

Hereinafter a scheme that the updated content of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station is synchronized between the MME and the SGSN by the ISR deactivation in the mobile station is described. The synchronization can be achieved by any of the following two examples 

 Example 2 Sending from the mobile station to both of the MME and the SGSN a notification of the update of the voice service configuration information.

The example 1 corresponds to the case where the mobile station actually deactivates the ISR in an explicit manner and informs the MME or the SGSN about the ISR deactivation. To be specific the mobile station locally deactivates the ISR by actually changing the TIN from RAT related TMSI to GUTI or P TMSI. The mobile station thereby performs a location registration procedure with the mobility management node e.g. the MME corresponding to the RAN to be reselected the RAN to which it moves during RAN reselection that is performed after the ISR deactivation in the mobile station . In this location registration procedure the mobile station sends a location registration request e.g. a TAU request indicating ISR deactivated. The ISR deactivated is indicated by the fact that a temporary identifier TMSI of the mobile station contained in the TAU request and the RAU request is GUTI or P TMSI not RAT related TMSI . According to a normal procedure when ISR is deactivated the mobility management node e.g. the MME which has received the location registration request indicating that the ISR is deactivated in the mobile station requests a context related to the mobile station to the other mobility management node e.g. the SGSN and receives it from the other mobility management node. Thus the context related to the mobile station containing the voice service configuration information is resynchronized between the MME and the SGSN .

Note that as is already described earlier the mobile station has performed a location registration procedure with the mobility management node e.g. the SGSN corresponding to the RAN before reselection the RAN from which it moves prior to the location registration procedure and the context resynchronization after the RAN reselection described above. Specifically when the voice service configuration information is updated in the mobile station when the ISR is activated the mobile station performs a location registration procedure with the mobility management node e.g. the SGSN corresponding to the currently selected RAN. The mobility management node e.g. the SGSN is thereby notified of the update of the voice service configuration information.

Accordingly in the example 1 the context containing the updated voice service configuration information that has been sent to one mobility management node e.g. the SGSN in advance is transferred to the other mobility management node e.g. the MME triggered by the location registration request after ISR deactivation. The updated content of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station is thereby synchronized between the MME and the SGSN .

The example 2 corresponds to the case where the mobile station does not inform the MME and the SGSN about ISR deactivation. Stated differently the mobile station deactivates the ISR in an implicit manner. In this case the mobile station does not need to explicitly perform local ISR deactivation. The mobile station thereby does not need to change the TIN. In the example 2 the mobile station informs both of the MME and the SGSN about the update of the voice service configuration information. To be more specific the mobile station may send a location registration request indicating the update of the voice service configuration information to both of the MME and the SGSN .

As is already described earlier when the voice service configuration information is updated in the mobile station when the ISR is activated the mobile station performs a location registration procedure with the mobility management node e.g. the SGSN corresponding to the currently selected RAN. The mobility management node e.g. the SGSN is thereby notified of the update of the voice service configuration information. To be specific the mobile station sends a location registration request e.g. a RAU request indicating the update of the voice service configuration information. The mobility management node e.g. the SGSN corresponding to the currently selected RAN can thereby recognize the update of the voice service configuration information.

Further in the example 2 the mobile station sends a location registration request indicating the update of the voice service configuration information also to the mobility management node e.g. the MME corresponding to the RAN to be reselected the RAN to which it moves . The mobility management node e.g. the MME corresponding to the RAN to be reselected the RAN to which it moves can thereby also recognize the update of the voice service configuration information. Accordingly the updated content of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station is synchronized between the MME and the SGSN .

The example 2 is significant in that the mobile station does not need to inform the network the MME and the SGSN about ISR deactivation. Further the MME and the SGSN can synchronize the updated content of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station with each other without signalling for context resynchronization. Note that however the example 1 has an advantage that the impact of a specification change is smaller compared to the example 2. This is because in the example 2 the mobile station is requested to perform an operation which is different from local ISR activation deactivation in the mobile station that is specified in the current 3GPP specifications.

As described above when the voice service configuration information stored in the mobile station is updated when the ISR is activated the mobile station deactivates the ISR in the mobile station . By the ISR deactivation a location registration procedure is performed between the mobile station and the mobility management node e.g. the MME or the SGSN corresponding to a RAN to which the mobile station moves at the time of RAN reselection that is performed after the update of the voice service configuration information. Then based on the location registration procedure the updated content of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station is synchronized between the MME and the SGSN . As described above the synchronization of the updated voice service configuration information between the MME and the SGSN may be achieved by context synchronization between the MME and the SGSN which is triggered by the location registration procedure between the mobile station and the mobility management node to which it moves. Alternatively the synchronization of the updated voice service configuration information between the MME and the SGSN may be achieved by sending a notification of the update of the voice service configuration information from the mobile station during the location registration procedure between the mobile station and the mobility management node to which it moves.

Hereinafter a configuration example of the mobile station is described. Further an example of the procedure to synchronizing between the MME and the SGSN the voice service configuration information updated in the mobile station is described. is a block diagram showing a configuration example of the mobile station . Note that shows only the major components related to the location registration procedure the ISR and the update of the voice service configuration information according to this embodiment.

The configuration example of includes a radio communication unit and a communication control unit . The radio communication unit is capable of connecting to a plurality of RANs which are the E UTRAN and the GERAN UTRAN in this example. The radio communication unit receives a downlink signal containing a plurality of physical downlink channels from a base station included in the E UTRAN or the GERAN UTRAN . Further the radio communication unit transmits an uplink signal containing a plurality of physical uplink channels to a base station.

The communication control unit performs signalling with the E UTRAN the GERAN UTRAN and the core network through the radio communication unit and controls the radio communication unit for sending and receiving control data and user data. Further the communication control unit performs digital baseband signal processing on the control data and user data. The digital baseband signal processing includes layer 2 signal processing and layer 1 physical layer signal processing. The layer 2 signal processing includes for example data compression decompression and data segmentation concatenation. The physical layer signal processing includes for example channel coding decoding and modulation demodulation.

In the example of the communication control unit includes an LTE control unit and a 2G 3G control unit . The LTE control unit performs communication control for connecting to LTE i.e. the E UTRAN and the EPC e.g. the MME . On the other hand the 2G 3G control unit performs communication control for connecting to UMTS i.e. the GERAN UTRAN and the GPRS packet core e.g. the SGSN .

The communication control unit performs communication control including the location registration procedure the processing related to the ISR and the update of the voice service configuration information described earlier. Thus in the case where the voice service configuration information VSC stored in the mobile station is updated when the ISR is activated the communication control unit deactivates the ISR in the mobile station .

The functions of the communication control unit may be implemented using a semiconductor processing device including ASIC Application Specific Integrated Circuit DSP Digital Signal Processor and the like. Further the functions of the communication control unit may be implemented by causing a computer such as a microprocessor to execute a program. Furthermore the functions of the communication control unit may be implemented by any combination of ASIC DSP and a microprocessor. For example at least part of the digital baseband signal processing may be performed in a DSP and the other processing e.g. the location registration procedure the processing related to the ISR and the update of the voice service configuration information may be performed in a microprocessor.

As described above at least some of the functions of the communication control unit may be implemented by causing a computer such as a microprocessor to execute a program. The program can be stored and provided to the computer using any type of non transitory computer readable medium. The non transitory computer readable medium includes any type of tangible storage medium. Examples of the non transitory computer readable medium include magnetic storage media such as floppy disks magnetic tapes hard disk drives etc. optical magnetic storage media e.g. magneto optical disks CD ROM Read Only Memory CD R CD R W and semiconductor memories such as mask ROM PROM Programmable ROM EPROM Erasable PROM flash ROM RAM Random Access Memory etc. . The program may be provided to a computer using any type of transitory computer readable medium. Examples of the transitory computer readable medium include electric signals optical signals and electromagnetic waves. The transitory computer readable medium can provide the program to a computer via a wired communication line such as an electric wire or optical fiber or a wireless communication line.

In Step S the voice service configuration information VSC stored in the mobile station is updated from the value A to the value B by an instruction from for example a user. In Step S the communication control unit i.e. the 2G 3G control unit of the mobile station sends a RAU request to the SGSN corresponding to the currently selected GERAN UTRAN . This RAU request contains a notification about the update of the voice service configuration information VSC. Upon receiving the RAU request the SGSN updates the voice service configuration information VSC stored for the mobile station to the notified value B Step S . In Step S the SGSN sends a RAU accept to the mobile station .

The RAU accept sent in Step S indicates whether the ISR is activated or not. In the example of the RAU accept sent in Step S indicates ISR activated . However regardless of an instruction of the RAU accept the mobile station i.e. the communication control unit spontaneously deactivates the ISR in the mobile station even when the RAU accept indicates ISR activated Step S . As is already described above the spontaneous and local ISR deactivation in the mobile station is achieved by changing the value of TIN from RAT related TMSI to GUTI for example regardless of an instruction of the RAU accept.

Note that the ISR deactivation in the mobile station is performed before or during RAN reselection occurring after the update of the voice service configuration information VSC. For example the communication control unit may deactivate the ISR in the mobile station in response to receiving the RAU accept in Step S regardless of an instruction of the RAU accept and continue the deactivated state until the next RAN selection. Alternatively the communication control unit may continue the ISR activated state when receiving the RAU accept in Step S according to an instruction of the RAU accept. In this case the communication control unit may memorize the occurrence of the update of the voice service configuration information and deactivate the ISR in the mobile station at the future RAN reselection.

In Step S the mobile station i.e. the communication control unit in the idle state determines to move from the GERAN UTRAN to the E UTRAN i.e. cell reselection . This cell reselection is Inter RAT cell reselection. At this time the ISR is deactivated in the mobile station . Thus in Step S the communication control unit i.e. the LTE control unit of the mobile station sends a TAU request to the MME corresponding to the E UTRAN to which it moves. This TAU request indicates that the ISR is deactivated in the mobile station . To be specific a temporary identifier of the mobile station contained in the TAU request is set to GUTI mapped from P TMSI .

Because the TAU request indicates ISR deactivated in the mobile station the MME carries out a procedure to restart the ISR with the SGSN Steps S S . Specifically the MME sends a context request related to the mobile station to the SGSN and receives a context response from the SGSN . The context related to the mobile station that is sent by the context response contains the updated voice service configuration information VSC the value B . Thus the MME updates the voice service configuration information VSC for the mobile station which have stored by the MME to the notified value B Step S . The voice service configuration information VSC updated in the mobile station is thereby synchronized between the MME and the SGSN .

A comparative example is described hereinafter with reference to . shows a procedure without performing an operation to deactivate the ISR in the mobile station triggered by the update of the voice service configuration information when the ISR is activated. In reference symbols for the mobile station and the core network are differentiated in order to clarify differences from this embodiment. The operations of a mobile station including a LTE control unit and a 2G 3G control unit and a core network including an MME and an SGSN in Steps S to S in are the same as Steps S to S shown in .

However in Step S the mobile station maintains the ISR activated state according to an instruction of the RAU accept in Step S. Specifically the value of the TIN remains RAT related TMSI which corresponds to ISR activated. Accordingly when the E UTRAN is selected in Inter RAT cell reselection in Step S the mobile station does not initiate an operation to send a TAU request because the ISR is activated in the mobile station Step S . Discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information VSC thereby arises between the MME and the SGSN .

If discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information VSC arises between the MME and the SGSN the following disadvantage will occur. For example one possible disadvantage is that the mobility management node e.g. the MME which has the voice service configuration information VSC before update or a base station controlled by the mobility management node indicates the priority of the RAN or RAT to the mobile station based on the voice service configuration information VSC before update. This can cause that the mobile station is requested to select the RAN or RAT that is not suitable for the voice service configuration information VSC after update. As an example despite that the mobile station supports IMS Voice Voice over IP the mobile station is instructed to preferentially select the GERAN UTRAN not the E UTRAN . In this case the mobile station misses an opportunity to use a high speed packet service by the LTE the E UTRAN and the EPC .

Another possible disadvantage is that the MME and the SGSN where discrepancy arises indicate different priorities to the E UTRAN and the GERAN UTRAN . This can cause that the mobile station frequently repeats reselection between the E UTRAN and the GERAN UTRAN . In this case the mobile station suffers from heavy battery consumption.

On the other hand the embodiment described with reference to can prevent the occurrence of discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information between the mobile station and a plurality of mobility management nodes corresponding to different RATs e.g. the MME and the SGSN . Accordingly it is possible to prevent the disadvantages assumed in the comparative example of .

The first embodiment describes several examples of the procedure to deactivate the ISR in the mobile station in response to the update of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station . The second embodiment describes one of those examples in detail. To be specific the second embodiment describes the example in which ISR deactivation in the mobile station is performed in response to receiving an instruction for deactivation from the MME or the SGSN . Note that the configuration of the mobile communication system according to the second embodiment may be the same as the configuration example shown in .

In the example of the SGSN which has received a RAU request containing a notification about the update of the voice service configuration information VSC determines that the ISR should be deactivated. Then in Step S the SGSN sends a RAU accept not containing an instruction of ISR activation stated differently a RAU accept indicating ISR deactivated to the mobile station . In Step S the mobile station deactivates the ISR in the mobile station according to an instruction from the SGSN indicated by the RAU accept.

Note that the synchronization of the voice service configuration information VSC can be performed in the same procedure as shown in also in the case where the voice service configuration information VSC is updated in the mobile station when the E UTRAN is selected and then the mobile station reselects the GERAN UTRAN after that.

According to the example shown in it is possible to solve the problem of discrepancy in the contents of the voice service configuration information without adding new functions to the mobile station . The mobile station only needs to deactivate the ISR state of itself according to the normal ISR operation specified in the current 3GPP specifications.

The ISR control unit performs signalling necessary to start the ISR with the mobility management node e.g. the MME of another RAT. Further the ISR control unit performs signalling necessary to start the ISR with a transfer node such as an S GW and with a subscriber information server such as an HSS.

Further the ISR control unit sends a location registration response i.e. RAU accept indicating ISR deactivated to the mobile station in response to receiving from the mobile station when the ISR is activated a location registration request i.e. RAU request indicating the update of the voice service configuration information stored in the mobile station .

When the RAU request does not indicate the update of the voice service configuration information VSC the ISR control unit continues the ISR activated state and sends a RAU accept indicating ISR activated to the mobile station which sent the RAU request Steps S and S . The case where the RAU request does not indicate the update of the voice service configuration information VSC is for example when the received RAU request is a normal periodical RAU request.

On the other hand when the RAU request indicates the update of the voice service configuration information VSC the ISR control unit determines to deactivate the ISR and sends a RAU accept not indicating ISR activated to the mobile station which sent the RAU request Steps S and S .

The first embodiment describes two examples of the scheme that the updated content of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station is synchronized between the MME and the SGSN . For the example 1 an illustrative sequence is shown in in the first embodiment. In the third embodiment an illustrative sequence for the example 2 is described. Note that the configuration of the mobile communication system according to the third embodiment may be the same as the configuration example shown in .

The example of corresponds to the case where the mobile station informs neither the MME nor the SGSN about ISR deactivation. Thus in Step S the mobile station does not perform an explicit local ISR deactivation. Specifically the mobile station i.e. the communication control unit maintains the TIM as RAT related TMSI corresponding to ISR activated. This is for the purpose of not informing the MME about ISR deactivation in the later step S.

However the mobile station i.e. the communication control unit memorizes that the voice service configuration information VSC has been updated in Step S but another RAT i.e. the MME related to the ISR has not been notified of the update. Specifically while the mobile station i.e. the communication control unit does not perform explicit ISR deactivation that triggers a notification to the network i.e. the MME and the SGSN it performs implicit ISR deactivation that does not trigger a notification to the network. Thus the communication control unit i.e. the LTE control unit sends a TAU request to the MME corresponding to the E UTRAN to which the mobile station moves in Step S. This TAU request contains a notification about the update of the voice service configuration information VSC just like the RAU request in Step S.

In the example shown in the mobile station does not need to inform the network i.e. the MME and the SGSN about ISR deactivation. Further in the example shown in the MME and the SGSN can synchronize the updated content of the voice service configuration information in the mobile station with each other without signalling for context resynchronization.

In the first to third embodiments a combined system of 3GPP UMTS and EPS Evolved Packet System is specifically described. However the technical ideas described in those embodiments can be applied generally in a mobile communication system that accommodates a plurality of different RAN RAT allows reselection between different RAN RAT and has similar scheme as the ISR for reducing signalling in location registration caused by the reselection. For example the first to third embodiments can be applied also to a mobile communication system that accommodates 3GPP RAT and non 3GPP RAT e.g. WiMAX IEEE802.16m .

Further the first to third embodiments can be combined as appropriate. Furthermore the invention is not limited to the embodiments described above and it will be obvious that various modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention described above.
