The invention described here may be made used and licensed by and for the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without paying royalty to me.

The present invention generally relates to methods and structures for protecting the occupants of a military vehicle. More particularly the invention relates to structures for mitigating the effect on vehicle occupants of an upward force on a vehicle created by an explosive blast underneath the vehicle. The device is intended for use on vehicles travelling in combat areas where land mines improvised explosive devices IEDs or like munitions explode as a vehicle passes over them. The invention is also related to military vehicle V hulls whose underside has a V shape or a truncated V shape the present invention is particularly suitable for such vehicles. V hulls deflect blast forces occurring under a vehicle to a generally outboard direction from the vehicle. The invention uses a vane that cooperates with the V hull to provide an additional deflection of blast force so that the blast force ultimately exerts a downward force component on a vehicle. The invention thus mitigates the vertical rise or hop of the vehicle when a mine explodes beneath it. The mitigating effect of the invention reduces spinal injuries or other injuries to occupants of the vehicle.

A relevant technology has to do with blast fences or jet blast deflectors commonly used at airports. These devices are wall like structures positioned behind jet aircraft so that jet exhaust is directed upward and away from nearby personnel equipment or buildings. Jet blast deflectors are described in numerous places an example being http en.wikipedia.arg wiki Jet blast deflector. A jet blast deflector is also shown by U.S. Pat. No. 7 437 987 B1 to Ohnstad et al. Another relevant technology is gun muzzle design wherein the muzzle has vents on the upper side. When the gun fires part of the effluent from the gun blast is directed upward by the vents so as to create a downward force counteracting rise of the gun barrel. An example of the aforementioned gun muzzle technology is U.S. Pat. No. 8 087 337 to Cary. The web site http www.brownells.com .aspx pid 27642 Product S W M P PRE FIT MATCH GRADE BARRELS shows anti rise gun muzzles as well.

Still another relevant technology has to do with spoilers air dams or wings fitted to automobiles. Air dams are used on the front of vehicles to reduce air flow under the vehicle as it travels thereby reducing drag. Spoilers on the aft ends of vehicles typically increase air pressure at the zone behind the rear window over the trunk to create down force at that zone. Other so called spoilers are actually wings that create down force on vehicles in the way aircraft wings create lift. A general discussion of vehicle air dams spoilers and wings is at http en.wikipedia.org wiki Spoiler automotive . Relevant art is also shown by a floor sweeper vehicle having a flap to upwardly deflect a stream of air and debris into a hopper as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6 154 922 to Vanderlinden.

Of possible relevance is U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011 014817 A1 to Tunis et al. The main thrust of Tunis is a structural through channel open at the top and bottom of a vehicle body to allow blast force under the vehicle to escape to a zone above the vehicle. Such a channel is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of Tunis. Additionally at FIGS. 25 through 28 of Tunis are notional diagrams of blast force vectors as at 974. These vectors are affected by a V hull of proposed vehicle 970 and proposed hull structural channels. FIGS. 26 and 27 show a vehicle hull incorporating elbow shaped structural channels 980. Tunis asserts that force vectors 974 directed along a V hull surface into channels 980 cause a net downward force on vehicle 970. But vector 974 in FIG. 26 is parallel to the lower half of channel 980 this vector would impact the outboard wall in the upper half of the channel 980. The impact is in an upward direction so the kinetic energy of effluent travelling along vector 974 imparts an upward force component on channel 980. Also a detonation at a location on the ground will have force vectors radiating from the location. Some of the radiating vectors will impact the underside or outboard side of the lower half of channel 980. The impact will cause an upward force component on vehicle 970. Tunis does not reveal how the foregoing impacts are overcome so as to result in a net downward force component caused by structural channels 970 in fact it appears that the aforementioned impacts cause a net upward force on vehicle 970.

The invention is structure for reducing injury to vehicle occupants caused by explosions beneath a vehicle. The structure mitigates the vehicle s upward acceleration or hop caused by the explosions. The invention is essentially a blade like vane cooperating with a vehicle hull to direct explosion forces upward thereby creating a downward force on the vehicle that reduces vehicle hop. The invention includes a rigid armored V shaped hull section on the vehicle s underside this section having an oblique underbody panel facing outboard and downward relative to the vehicle. There is a wall panel of the vehicle disposed adjacently above and along the oblique body panel. The juncture between the oblique underbody panel and the wall panel defines a border along which the vane is disposed and the vane is located completely outboard of both the oblique body panel and the wall panel. The vane is oriented at a first acute angle with the oblique underbody panel and is also oriented at a second acute angle with respect to a vertical plane. Brackets or other suitable means are used for attaching the blast deflector vane to the V shaped hull section. In an alternative embodiment one or more blast deflector vanes are incorporated in a running board disposed along the border.

The following definitions and terminology are applied as understood by one skilled in the appropriate art.

The singular forms such as a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. For example reference to a material includes reference to one or more of such materials and an element includes reference to one or more of such elements.

As used herein substantial and about when used in reference to a quantity or amount of a material dimension characteristic parameter and the like refer to an amount that is sufficient to provide an effect that the material or characteristic was intended to provide as understood by one skilled in the art. The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation. Similarly substantially free of or the like refers to the lack of an identified composition characteristic or property. Particularly assemblies that are identified as being substantially free of are either completely absent of the characteristic or the characteristic is present only in values which are small enough that no meaningful effect on the desired results is generated.

Concentrations values dimensions amounts and other quantitative data may be presented herein in a range format. One skilled in the art will understand that such range format is used for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub range is explicitly recited. For example a size range of about 1 dimensional unit to about 100 dimensional units should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits but also to include individual sizes such as 2 dimensional units 3 dimensional units 10 dimensional units and the like and sub ranges such as 10 dimensional units to 50 dimensional units 20 dimensional units to 100 dimensional units and the like.

For a vehicle and a system mounted on or used in connection with the vehicle forward reverse longitudinal and vertical up down directions are generally relative to the vehicle and system as typically operated e.g. when the vehicle is operated with the respective powertrain in a forward reverse mode . As such lateral left right directions are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal vertical plane and are referenced from a vehicle operator e.g. driver perspective. A first direction e.g. forward and a second direction e.g. rearward or reverse where the second direction substantially but not necessarily wholly opposes the first direction are also generally or used in connection with the vehicle. Likewise elements located mounted positioned placed installed etc. on near or proximate to the vehicle body are generally referred to as inner while elements that are distal or more remote to the vehicle body are generally referred to as outer unless otherwise noted. As such inner elements are generally closer to the vehicle body than outer elements. Unless otherwise stated a vehicle is presumed to be standing on a horizontal surface and vehicle components such as a body panel or window that are vertically oriented are disposed normal to the horizontal surface. Likewise the vertical or a vertical plane refers to a plane normal to the horizontal surface upon which the vehicle rests.

Vane is preferably disposed along but completely outboard of hull section and hull panel . Vane is typically two to three inches wide and the bottom or lower edge of vane is typically disposed two to three inches outboard from front hull section . It is preferred that lower edge be lower closer to plane than the inter panel border or nexus between forward hull panel and forward hull section preferably by a distance of one half an inch to an inch. It is also preferred that upper edge be higher further from plane than the border . The border can be rounded as shown at or can form an edge line as shown at in . Vane is typically at least three feet in length but can be longer optionally vane can extend across the width of V hull .

Another blast deflector can be placed on the rearward end of vehicle along border between rearward hull panel and rear hull section . The angular orientation and disposition of the additional deflector is the same as shown in except that rear hull section shown in phantom for illustrative purposes in is canted inboard and is thus not vertically oriented as is front hull section . For most applications it is preferred that pairs of deflectors are symmetrically formed and located. Thus it is normally preferred that the deflectors at the rearward and forward ends of the vehicle are mirror images of one another are both centered with respect to a vertical plane along the vehicle s longitudinal axis and are equidistant from plane .

It is also contemplated that a blast deflector similar to that shown in can be mounted to the sides of vehicle as shown at in . Aside from its length vane is shaped oriented and disposed in the same fashion as is vane and can optionally extend as far as the entire length of hull . Vane will be disposed at the same angle relative to hull section or hull section or other vertically oriented component as vane is disposed relative to forward hull section . Vane can also be said to form the acute angle with a vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal front to back axis of vehicle . Vane will extend slightly below side inter panel border in the same way vane extends slightly below front inter panel border .

Vanes can but need not extend the full length of the vehicle. It is normally preferred that the deflectors on the sides of the vehicle are symmetric such that they are mirror images of one another are both centered with respect to a vertical plane along the vehicle s transverse axis and are equidistant from plane . It is also preferred that vanes and will have similar widths and thicknesses and are sufficiently rigid and strong to prevent deformation or damage by detonations under vehicle . When a land mine improvised explosive device IED or other blast mechanism detonates underneath a military vehicle the detonation typically does not occur under the center of the vehicle. The detonation is commonly forward or aft of the vehicle center and is commonly either to the right or left of the vehicle s center. Consequently depending on the location of the detonation any downwardly or partly downwardly facing surface on or at the underside of vehicle can be impacted by the detonation and contribute to upward acceleration of the vehicle. Therefore it is considered advantageous that vanes of blast deflector or are disposed completely outboard of vehicle hull . As seen in vane of deflector has an outboard face which is tilted downwardly. Depending on the location of a detonation underneath a vehicle locating deflector underneath the hull and not outboard of the hull would cause vane to contribute to or at least not mitigate upward acceleration of vehicle . Note that mine blasts or the like occurring outboard of the vehicle are less likely to cause vehicle hop or will cause less vehicle hop than blasts under and inboard of the vehicle and this fact is considered in the design of the invention herein. While outboard blasts are not to be ignored they present less of a problem in terms of vehicle hop than inboard blasts.

When a mine blast or the like impacts the underside of V hull the hull directs blast force outboard. For example as seen in forward hull panel directs blast force originating beneath the vehicle in the direction of vector along oblique panel so that the blast force impacts strike face of vane . The impact force on vane can be resolved into component force vectors and where vector has a horizontal outboard direction and vector has a vertical downward direction. The force along vector mitigates the upward acceleration or hop of vehicle which is caused by a detonation under a vehicle.

It will also be understood that explosions from land mines or IEDs can vary in nature. For example some mines or IEDs are constructed or buried so that the blast force from detonation is mainly straight upward. Other mines or IEDs have blast forces that propagate from a center to form a generally hemispherical wave front at the blast periphery. As a function of the mine s or IED s nature and the under vehicle location of a detonation there can be a variable blast force vector impacting vane or that is different from vector . Such an additional blast force vector is exemplified by vector in . Vane or is preferably oriented so that additional force vectors as at will either impact strike face to create additional downward thrust or else have no vertical thrust effect. Accordingly vane or is oriented essentially edgewise relative to additional force vectors such as vector as seen in . It will be understood that blast deflectors and are designed for V hulled vehicles with attention to the blast resistance strength and rigidity of the vehicles lower hull components. Inhibition of vehicle hop by deflectors and during detonations increases the effective impact force experienced by underbody components of the vehicles. Thus one may consider the need for additional rigidity and strength in underbody panels such as panel and on vehicle likewise one may consider the rigidity and strength of forward hull panel and rearward hull panel . It is believed that many V hulled military vehicles such as the U.S. Army s Mine Resistant Ambush Protective MRAP vehicle presently possess the hull strength rigidity and hardness to accommodate addition of deflectors or . For other V hulled vehicles it is believed that conventional approaches to reinforcing underbody armor can be used to modify them if necessary to accommodate blast deflectors and .

When a blast force travels along panel in the direction of vector the blast force will impact vanes so as to create a downward force component which inhibits hop of the vehicle on which running board is installed. Running board also serves as a conventional vehicle running board by providing a step for soldiers entering a vehicle or providing a platform upon which a soldier may stand when servicing or loading the vehicle.

Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims.
