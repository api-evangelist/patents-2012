title: Low radar cross section array panel
abstract: A low RCS array panel employs a number of linkable support segments. Each support segment has several junctions spaced along it, and the support segments are designed to connect with each other at the junctions to create a support grid. The segments can connect orthogonally, and the junctions can be spaced according to the frequency performance requirements for the antenna the array panel is designed to support.

This Application claims rights under 35 USC 119 e from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 522 754 filed Aug. 12 2011 the contents of which are incorporate herein by reference.

The invention was made with United States Government assistance under contract No. FA86290 06 G 4028 0008 awarded by the US Air Force. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to antenna support panels and more particularly to low weight and low reflective antenna array support panels.

When supporting antenna elements in an array element size and frequency range dictate the weight for the antenna array support. Typical array panels provide a ground plane that forms a large reflecting surface causing undesirable radar reflection and a large Radar Cross Section RCS . Planar array supports offer support for the element weight and create a ground plane with a large RCS even for elements that may not require a ground plane. Particularly in the battlefield a large RCS is a large detriment and can be extremely dangerous. A need therefore exists for an antenna array panel that provides consistent array geometry support while limiting weight and RCS.

In order to solve the above problems a low RCS array support panel includes a grid or lattice composed of a number of overlying support segments with overlying support segments having junctions spaced along the support segments. In order to form the lattice in one embodiment the overlying support segments are each designed to connect with each other at the junctions and may be secured by welding and the like. In one embodiment support plates are provided at the junction and are used to mount the antenna elements.

According to one embodiment the support segments are designed to connect orthogonally at the junctions. In another embodiment the support segments are made of mirror image wire segments joined together along their lengths except at the junctions where they are opened to receive a support plate. In a further embodiment the support segments are made of non metal members such as overlying plastic ribs. In another embodiment the junctions are placed along the support segments according to the frequency requirements of the antenna array that will be supported by the array support panel.

More particularly the low RCS array support panel in one embodiment offers support for elements that do not require a ground plane while reducing the RCS for the overall array and at the same time providing a lower assembly weight. The low RCS array support panel permits the formation of antenna arrays of varying sizes with minimal reflecting surfaces. The low RCS array support panel in one embodiment provides support for antenna elements by using an easily assembled adjustable design. The array support panel also implements convenient pre formed methods of construction so that antenna arrays may be fabricated and supported with a low RCS grid or lattice.

Referring now to a planar antenna array is composed a number of printed circuit card antenna elements located in a diamond shaped pattern across an antenna array support panel with antenna element printed circuit cards being mounted between notched support columns as illustrated.

One of the problems with the mounting of such an antenna array is to provide a support structure that has a relatively low radar cross section.

If for instance the elements are mounted to a metalized support panel for instance to provide a ground plane or the like for the antenna array then the panel itself presents a relatively high radar cross section which is undesirable.

There is therefore a requirement to provide a suitable mounting system for antenna arrays whether of the printed circuit card variety shown in or individual elements extended up from a ground plane. It is the purpose of array support panel to support the antenna array elements in the proper position along the array while at the same time minimizing the radar cross section.

Referring to a low radar cross section antenna array support panel in one embodiment is made up of a lattice work or grid of overlying transverse segments and shown here unconnected. These overlying segments in one embodiment are composed of molded or performed wire pairs and that are separated at an aperture . Aperture in one segment is adapted to overlie an aperture in an underlying crossed segment here illustrated at with a support plate located within the aperture.

The subject array support panel is fabricated as a low RCS grid or lattice structure in which the segments may be located orthogonal one to the other and are cross linked at a junction aperture.

Note that the overlying apertures form cross linked segments and create a relief region for the periodic placement of the support plates. Here the support plate is illustrated with a central aperture or hole adapted to accommodate a screw or bolt therethrough.

The array support panel lattice may be configured with the aforementioned apertures spaced apart at distances commensurate with the operating characteristics of the antenna to be mounted thereon with the support plates securing the antenna elements for the formation of the antenna array.

The completed array support panel lattice or grid is shown in in which apertures and are shown to include support plate into hole which is formed.

The overlying lattice work structure composed in one embodiment of orthogonal segments may be formed by welding the overlying structures together or in some other way bonding or connecting the overlying structures in a cross linking manner which may also involve interlocking features of the overlying segments.

While the subject array support panel is shown in one embodiment to incorporate mirror image wire pairs the support structure may be made of plastic and spot welded to create the lattice type support structure it being understood that in this particular embodiment there is no ground plane provided by the support structure.

It is noted that the support plates of may be spaced according to the frequency performance requirements defined for the antenna array being supported. It is also noted that the metallic elements of the support panel may be placed behind the active area of the antenna elements with the area between the wire pairs that form the array grid left open to the antenna environment thus reducing the weight of the antenna array assembly while at the same time creating a support panel with little or no extra reflective surfaces. It is noted that it is the reduced reflectivity of the support panel that provides for the low radar cross section described above.

While the array support panel being of an open work lattice or grid may be used to support the printed circuit card antenna array elements shown in it will be appreciated that the support plates may be utilized to support for instance vertically upstanding antenna elements. Thus the subject array support panel is not limited to the mounting of printed circuit card antenna array elements.

More particularly and referring to columns of may include a square cross section member having longitudinally running slots on all four sides of the member.

It will be appreciated that this column is anchored to support plate with a screw or bolt that runs up through hole in support plate .

The construction of the printed circuit card antenna array element structure is shown in in which numbers of support columns are mounted on associated support plates with the array support panel grid or lattice locating the columns in any one of a number of desired patterns to house the supported printed circuit cards. The arrangement of shows an arrangement that would support the diamond shaped array of but is shown for illustrative purposes only.

Referring to what is shown are opposed columns housing a printed circuit card therebetween. Here each of the columns are secured screwed or bolted to the associated support plate . This provides a secure low radar cross section mounting system with the crossovers of the lattice defining a predetermined pattern related to the operational frequency of the array.

While the present invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment.
