The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 407 111 entitled Systems and Methods for Migrating Customers to Alternative Financial Products and filed on Feb. 28 2012 the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

Aspects of the disclosure relate generally to financial products and more particularly to systems and methods for evaluating alternative financial products for customer migration.

Many financial institutions wish to migrate customers from existing financial products to alternative financial products. For example a financial institution may wish to migrate customers from a free product such as a free checking account product or a free debit account product to one or more fee based alternative products. However while the increased revenue that may be obtained by migration of customers to alternative products is attractive the increased revenue may be easily offset or significantly reduced by customer attrition. Accordingly the context of the disclosure relates to automated systems associated with financial product migration.

Certain embodiments of the disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which example embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the representative embodiments set forth herein rather these representative embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those of ordinary skill in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

Certain embodiments of the disclosure may provide systems and methods for performing pre migration testing in association with financial product migrations. In one example embodiment a set of customers that are eligible for migration from a first financial product e.g. a free checking account a free debit account etc. to a second financial product e.g. a fee based checking account a fee based debit account etc. may be identified. A wide variety of suitable techniques may be utilized to identify the set of customers. For example a financial institution e.g. a bank etc. that provides the financial products may identify the set of customers. As another example a plurality of customers associated with the financial institution may be evaluated utilizing any number of suitable criteria and or parameters e.g. parameters and or criteria associated with various alternative financial products and a subset of the plurality of customers may be identified as the set of customers eligible for migration. As yet another example a service provider may identify the set of customers on behalf of the financial institution and the identified set of customers may be received from the service provider.

Once a set of customers eligible for migration to a second financial product has been identified a pre migration test may be performed for a subset of the eligible customers. Based at least in part upon the results of the pre migration test an attrition risk associated with the migration of the set of customers to the second financial product may be determined or calculated. In the event that the attrition risk is determined to be acceptable a migration of the set of customers to the second financial product may be directed. In the event that the attrition risk is determined to be unacceptable a wide variety of different actions may be taken as desired in various embodiments. For example the set of customers eligible for migration to the second financial product may be modified. As another example one or more parameters or characteristics associated with the second financial product may be modified. In this regard pre migration testing may be utilized to perform one or more optimizations associated with the migration of customers of a financial institution from existing financial products to any number of alternative financial products.

A wide variety of suitable techniques may be utilized as desired to perform a pre migration test. In one example embodiment a respective pre migration notice attrition risk also referred to as a pre notice risk may be determined for each of the customers included in a subset of customers. As desired the pre notice risk for a customer may be compared to one or more threshold values. If it is determined that the pre notice risk fails to satisfy the one or more threshold values the customer may be removed from the subset and in certain embodiments one or more additional customers may be added to the subset. Following the determination of pre notice attrition risks a respective migration notice may be communicated to each of the customers in the subset. A respective post migration notice attrition risk also referred to as a post notice risk may then be determined for each of the customers. An attrition risk associated with the migration of the eligible customers may then be determined from the pre notice attrition risks and the post notice attrition risks. For example an average change in the pre notice attrition risks and the post notice attrition risks may be calculated. The average change may then be compared to any number of suitable threshold values in order to determine whether a migration should be completed.

Other embodiments of the disclosure may provide systems and methods for determining and or optimizing one or more characteristics associated with an alternative product for migration. In one example embodiment one or more customers of a financial institution eligible for migration to an alternative product e.g. eligible for migration to a first financial product from a second financial product etc. may be identified. An attrition risk associated with the migration may then be determined for example by performing pre migration testing. In the event that the attrition risk satisfies one or more threshold values the migration of the one or more customers may be directed and or carried out. However in the event that the attrition risk fails to satisfy the one or more threshold values one or more characteristics associated with the alternative product may be modified. As desired an attrition risk associated with the modified product may be calculated and evaluated in order to determine whether a migration should be directed and or carried out. Further modifications may be performed as desired until relatively optimal alternative product characteristics have been determined.

Additionally as desired in various embodiments once a migration has been initiated and or carried out any number of attrition mitigation procedures may be performed with respect to one or more customers. For example an attrition risk associated with a customer may be identified or determined either following the communication of a migration notice to the customer or following the migration of the customer to an alternative financial product. In the event that the attrition risk fails to satisfy one or more thresholds associated with an acceptable attrition risk one or more mitigation procedures may be performed. In this regard an attempt may be made to retain the customer.

It will be appreciated that the evaluations and or optimizations described herein or at least a portion thereof can be performed by any number of financial systems such as one or more service providers one or more financial service providers a financial institution or a combination thereof.

In various embodiments of the invention a wide variety of migration related services may be performed. These services include for example pre migration testing evaluation and or optimization of alternative financial products and or post migration risk mitigation. In certain embodiments pre migration testing may evaluate an attrition risk associated with a mass migration of financial institution customers from one or more existing products e.g. a free checking account product a free debit account product etc. to one or more alternative financial products such as one or more fee based products. As desired various tiers of alternative financial products may be evaluated. Additionally in certain embodiments the results of pre migration testing may be utilized to modify and or determine parameters associated with alternative financial products as well as to modify the assignment of customers for migration to various alternative financial products. In this regard attrition risks may be managed during the migration of customers to alternative financial products.

At block definitions associated with one or more target products or alternative financial products may be identified. Additionally any number of parameters associated with the products may be identified. In certain embodiments a financial institution or a service provider acting on behalf of the financial institution may define a set of target products or product tiers for a given type of financial product. Customers of the financial institution may then be migrated to various target products or product tiers. For example the financial institution may have a plurality of customers that are currently provided with a free checking account product. In an attempt to migrate customers to fee based checking arrangements the financial institution may define a plurality of different checking account target products. As another example the financial institution may define a set of target products associated with debit card products.

Additionally the financial institution or a service provider may define any number of parameters or characteristics for each of the target products. For any given product these parameters may include for example qualification criteria for a customer to be eligible for migration to a product and or any number of attributes associated with the product. A wide variety of suitable qualification criteria may be utilized to facilitate assignment of customers to various target or alternative products. Examples of suitable qualification criteria include but are not limited to a minimum balance to be maintained in a financial account a minimum daily or average balance to be maintained in a financial account within a given period of time e.g. the previous month the previous three months etc. a minimum or average transaction volume e.g. a number of transactions a total monetary amount of transactions etc. to be maintained within a given period of time a minimum or average number of various types of transactions to be completed within a given period of time e.g. a minimum number of debit transactions per month a minimum number of bill payment transactions per month etc. criteria associated with revenue generated e.g. interest revenue revenue from insufficient funds NSF fees etc. and or criteria associated with other accounts e.g. checking accounts mortgage accounts loan accounts savings accounts money market accounts etc. and or relationships e.g. electronic banking services direct deposit services EBPP services etc. that customers have with the financial institution. In certain embodiments initially identified qualification criteria may be modified by the financial system during the performance of migration related services.

The attributes of a product may specify any number of terms and conditions associated with the product. These terms and conditions may specify or define the services encompassed by the product pricing for the product and or required customer behavior associated with the product. Example attributes include but are not limited to pricing terms for the product e.g. fixed monthly fees transaction based fees NSF fees etc. permitted activities associated with use of the product pricing for additional activities associated with use of the product a minimum balance to be maintained a minimum or average balance to be maintained within a given period of time e.g. the previous month the previous three months etc. a minimum or average transaction volume e.g. a number of transactions a total monetary amount of transactions etc. to be maintained within a given period of time a minimum or average number of various types of transactions to be completed within a given period of time etc. Additionally in certain embodiments the attributes may include alternative pricing associated with different types of customer behavior. For example the attributes may specify reduced pricing based upon certain behavior e.g. a threshold number or volume of transactions a threshold number of direct deposits or direct deposits per month a threshold number of bill payments or bill payments per month etc. . Indeed a wide variety of different product attributes may be specified as desired. Additionally in certain embodiments initially identified attributes may be modified by the financial system during the performance of migration related services.

As one simplified example of product parameters the financial institution may define four types of checking accounts as target products. Example account types may include a flat fee checking account an extended flat fee checking account a regular checking account and a free checking account. The flat fee checking option may typically be utilized for accounts with relatively low balances and relatively moderate account activity e.g. 10 15 checks per month . The extended flat fee checking option may have a higher fee than the flat fee checking option and the extended flat fee option may be utilized for accounts with relatively low balances and higher account activity e.g. more than 15 checks per month . The regular checking account option may be utilized for accounts in which unlimited checking is allowed and the regular checking account option may be associated with an established fee schedule. For example a base monthly fee and or a fee for each check or other transaction e.g. electronic transaction ATM withdrawal etc. may be charged. As desired the fees may be reduced or eliminated in the event that a minimum balance e.g. a minimum daily balance etc. is maintained or in the event that other types of transactions e.g. automatic deposits etc. and or customer behavior e.g. use of online banking and or bill payment occurs. The free checking option may be utilized for the most valuable customers and or for customers that maintain a predetermined account balance and or that otherwise satisfy a set of conditions e.g. total asset on deposit conditions loan or credit account conditions transaction type conditions customer behavior conditions etc. . The product offerings described above are provided by way of example only and other offerings may be utilized as desired in other embodiments of the invention.

A wide variety of suitable methods may be utilized by a financial system to identify definitions of target products and or various product parameters. In certain embodiments the financial system may access definitions and or parameters from memory. In other embodiments the financial system may receive definitions and or parameters from one or more external data sources such as a financial institution system or a service provider system. A wide variety of suitable methods and or techniques may be utilized to receive definitions and or parameters. For example definitions and or parameters may be received via a Web interface hosted by the financial system. As another example definitions and or parameters may be received via batch data transmission and or via any number of application service calls.

At block information associated with a wide variety of risk thresholds for target product offerings and or product migrations may be identified. In certain embodiments a financial institution or service provider may establish one or more risk thresholds for each product tier and the thresholds may be utilized to evaluate proposed product migrations and or to perform any number of risk mitigation procedures. A wide variety of suitable techniques may be utilized to establish risk thresholds. For example risk thresholds may be established by trial and error. As another example risk thresholds may be established based upon a statistical analysis of historical information. Additionally a wide variety of suitable methods may be utilized by a financial system to identify risk thresholds. For example risk thresholds may be accessed from memory received via batch transmission received via one or more application service calls and or received via a Web interface hosted by the financial system.

A wide variety of respective risk thresholds may be identified for each target product offering. As one example a first threshold may define a maximum pre migration notice attrition risk to be utilized during the evaluation of individual customers a second threshold may define a maximum average change in attrition risk for use during the evaluation of a set of customers following the communication of migration notices to the set of customers and a third threshold may define a maximum individual attrition risk associated with performing post migration attrition mitigation procedures. These example thresholds will be described in greater detail below with reference to and . Additionally it should be noted that other types of risk thresholds may be utilized as desired in various embodiments. The risk thresholds described herein are provided by way of example only.

At block assignments of financial institution customers to various target products e.g. tiers of products etc. may be identified. In certain embodiments a financial institution system or service provider system may provide information associated with customer assignments to various target products to the financial system. In other embodiments one or more criteria associated with the assignment of customers to target products may be obtained and utilized to facilitate the assignment of customers to various target products. For example at least a portion of the qualification criteria identified at block may be utilized to evaluate a customer base of the financial institution e.g. a plurality of customers that are currently provided an existing or first financial product etc. and to facilitate customer assignments to various target products or alternative products.

In certain embodiments customer information e.g. historical account and or transaction information associated with customers customer behavior information etc. may be evaluated utilizing the qualification criteria for the target products and customers may be assigned to target products based at least in part upon the evaluation. For example if a customer has a minimum account balance and transactional volume that qualifies the customer for a particular target product then the customer may be assigned to the relevant target product. Accordingly as a result of the evaluation of customer information utilizing qualification criteria a respective set of customers may be identified for potential migration to one or more target products to be offered by a financial institution.

A wide variety of other factors may additionally or alternatively be taken into consideration during the assignment of customers to target products. These factors may include but are not limited to customer segmentation customer valuation and or factors associated with customer fee sensitivity. For example if a customer has a relatively high value to a financial institution e.g. the customer generates relatively high income etc. and it appears that the customer is relatively sensitive to fees then the customer may be assigned to a target product that has lower fees e.g. a free product etc. or to a relatively lower attrition risk product tier.

In certain embodiments the evaluation of customer information may result in a determination that a customer qualifies for or is eligible for migration to more than one target product. In the event that a customer is determined to qualify for multiple target products a wide variety of suitable rules and or evaluations may be utilized to select a target product to which the customer will be assigned. As one example the customer may be assigned to a target product that is a best fit e.g. determined via a best fit analysis or algorithm to the customer s criteria historical information and or behavior. As another example the customer may be assigned to a target product that will provide a higher amount of revenue e.g. fees interest etc. to the financial institution. As yet another example the customer may be assigned to the target product that will result in a lower attrition risk with respect to the customer and or that will impose a lower fee increase to the customer. As yet another example a customer segmentation customer value and or other customer information may be utilized to select a target product. As desired in various embodiments the rules and or evaluations that facilitate conflict determination may be obtained from a financial institution or a service provider system. In other embodiments default rules and or evaluations may be utilized.

At block a next target product or alternative product may be selected for evaluation. For example if three product tiers have been established a next product tier may be selected. Additionally a set or group of customers that have been assigned to the selected target product may be identified. At block a subset of the customers assigned to the selected target product may be identified selected or determined. In this regard the subset of customers may be evaluated in order to determine risks associated with migrating the set of customers to the selected product. For example a product migration test may be performed with respect to the subset of customers and the results of the product migration test may be evaluated in order to determine whether the set of customers should be migrated to the target product.

A wide variety of suitable methods and or techniques may be utilized to select a subset of customers assigned to the selected target product. For example in certain embodiments a random sample of customers may be selected for the subset. As another example every nth customer may be selected from the set of customers in order to determine a subset. Other techniques for selecting a subset will be appreciated. As desired the size of the subset may be proportional to the size of the set of customers assigned to the selected target product. In this regard the subset may be sufficient to provide statistically significant results that are applicable to the set of customers. For example a random sample may be sized to ensure a desired confidence level during product migration testing e.g. an approximately 95 confidence level etc. .

At block a product migration test may be conducted for the selected product. A product migration test may include any number of suitable operations that facilitate a determination of a risk associated with a migration of the set of customers to the selected product. In certain embodiments a product migration test may include a combination of pre migration notice evaluations and or post notice evaluations. For example one or more operations and or evaluations may be performed prior to the transmission of migration notices to the customers included in the subset. As desired the subset customer assignments and or product parameters may be modified based at least in part upon the pre notice evaluations. One example of pre notice operations that may be performed in certain embodiments is described in greater detail below with reference to . Additionally in certain embodiments one or more operations and or evaluations may be performed subsequent to the transmission of migration notices to the customers included in the subset e.g. an initial subset or a modified subset . As desired the subset customer assignments and or product parameters may be modified based at least in part upon the post notice evaluations. One example of post notice operations that may be performed in certain embodiments is described in greater detail below with reference to .

Based at least in part upon conducting a product migration test at block a migration risk associated with migrating the full set of customers assigned to the selected product may be determined. In certain embodiments the migration risk may represent an attrition risk associated with the migration. At block a determination may be made as to whether the migration risk is acceptable. For example the migration risk may be compared to a suitable migration risk threshold e.g. the second threshold described above with reference to block etc. and a determination as to whether the risk is acceptable may be made based at least in part upon the comparison.

If it is determined at block that a migration risk is not acceptable then operations may continue at block . At block a wide variety of suitable modifications may be performed based at least in part upon the determination that the migration risk is unacceptable. For example one or more attributes of the selected product may be modified or adjusted in an attempt to lower the attrition risk associated with product migration. A wide variety of product attributes may be modified as desired in various embodiments including but not limited to one or more pricing attributes one or more services associated with the selected financial product and or one or more attributes associated with required customer behavior. In certain embodiments new target products may be generated and or a number of product tiers may be modified e.g. a product tier may be added a product tier may be removed etc. . As another example one or more qualification criteria associated with the assignment of customers to the selected product may be adjusted. As desired the assignment of a customer base to one or more target products may be recalculated following the adjustment of one or more qualification criteria. As yet another example other modifications of the set of customers assigned to the target product may be performed. In yet other embodiments both one or more target product attributes and a set of customers assigned to the target product may be modified.

Following the modifications performed at block operations may continue at block . At block a new sample of customers may be selected for evaluation. For example a new sample of customers may be selected from a set of customers assigned to a modified target product. As another example a new sample of customers assigned to a target product may be selected following a reassignment of a portion or all of a customer base. The new sample may be selected in a similar manner as that described above at block . In certain embodiments customers previously evaluated during a prior product migration test e.g. customers included in a previously evaluated sample may be excluded from the sample selected at block .

Once a new sample has been selected at block operations may continue at block and a product migration test may be conducted for the new sample. In this regard product migration testing may be conducted until a determination is made that a migration risk is acceptable. As a result attrition risk associated with the migration of customers to alternative financial products may be reduced. Additionally parameters associated with one or more alternative financial products may be optimized in order to reduce and or minimize attrition risks associated with customer migration.

If however it is determined at block that the migration risk is acceptable then operations may continue at block . At block the financial system may execute and or direct the execution of a migration program with respect to the selected target product or modified target product . In certain embodiments the financial system may direct a financial institution or a service provider to carry out a product migration with respect to any number of customers of the financial institution. In other embodiments the financial system may carry out a product migration. A product migration program may include any number of suitable operations. As one example respective migration notices may be communicated to the customers included in a set for migration to a target product. The migration notices may include a wide variety of suitable information such as criteria associated with the target product and or a date e.g. 30 days out 60 days out etc. at which the migration will occur. Once the migration date is reached the customers may be migrated from an existing or first product to the target product. Additionally as desired in various embodiments respective attrition risks associated with one or more customers may be determined following the communication of a migration notice and or following the migration of the customers. Based at least in part upon the attrition risks and or any number of other factors e.g. customer value etc. one or more attrition mitigation procedures may be directed and or performed. A few example operations for facilitating a product migration and or attrition risk mitigation are described in greater detail below with reference to .

Following the execution of a migration program at block operations may continue at block . At block a determination may be made as to whether the end of the target products has been reached. If it is determined at block that the end of the products has not been reached then operations may continue at block and a next target product may be selected for evaluation. Otherwise if it is determined at block that the end of the products has been reached then operations may end. Additionally although the method describes the sequential evaluation of various target products in certain embodiments a plurality of target products may be evaluated in parallel. In certain embodiments multiple pre migration tests may be performed in parallel for a particular financial institution. The method may end following block .

At block a sample of customers such as a subset of customers assigned to a target product or alternative financial product may be identified. Additionally a next customer included in the sample or subset of customers may be selected for evaluation. At block a determination may be made as to whether the end of the sample has been reached. If it is determined at block that the end of the sample has not been reached then operations may continue at block described below and the selected customer may be evaluated. If however it is determined at block that the end of the sample has been reached then operations of the method may end. Accordingly the method may facilitate the evaluation of each of the customers included in the sample. Although described herein as sequential evaluations in certain embodiments any number of customers may be evaluated in parallel.

At block a pre migration notice attrition risk may be calculated for the selected customer. A wide variety of suitable methods techniques algorithms formulas and or models may be utilized as desired to calculate or determine a pre notice attrition risk. Additionally any number of suitable factors predictors and or weightings may be utilized to calculate or determine the attrition risk. In certain embodiments one or more predictive models may be invoked and or utilized in order to determine an attrition risk for the customer. The attrition risk may be expressed for example as a probability or a score within an applicable range. The one or more predictive models utilized to evaluate the customer may be identified and or selected based at least in part upon a wide variety of different factors such as one or more customer attributes. As one example a predictive model may be identified based upon the tenure of the customer with the financial institution. A few examples of predictive models that may be utilized are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 893 822 filed Sep. 29 2010 and entitled Systems and Methods for Customer Value Optimization Involving Product Service Optimization and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 893 841 filed Sep. 29 2010 and entitled Systems and Methods for Customer Value Optimization Involving Relationship Optimization. Each of these applications is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

A wide variety of different types of techniques may be utilized as desired to generate or form predictive models such as logistic regression models neural network models and or other types of models. In certain embodiments a model may be generated by evaluating historical data associated with financial institution customers including historical data associated with customers that closed accounts with the financial institution. For example historical data may be obtained from the core account systems of one or more financial institutions and the historical data may be processed in order to generate an attrition model. The process of devising an attrition model may involve identifying one or more data attributes that provide a best indication of customer attrition and or determining appropriate weightings of the attributes and or relationships between the attributes. In this regard customer values for the attributes may be provided to the model in order to predict customer attrition. As desired a model may be specific to a particular financial institution or alternatively the model may have a scope that encompasses a plurality of financial institutions. Additionally a model may be adjusted based upon the presence of new data. For example a model may be periodically adjusted or a model may be adjusted following the identification of a predetermined event.

Once generated a predictive model may be utilized to evaluate data associated with a customer in order to determine an attrition risk associated with the customer. In certain embodiments current data for a customer may be provided to a predictive model and or formula in order to determine an attrition risk. As desired in other embodiments current and or historical account data for the customer such as relatively recent transactional data for a predetermined past period may be collected and at least a portion of the historical account data may be provided to and or run through a predictive model. In certain embodiments data may be periodically obtained e.g. once a day once a week once a month etc. from a financial institution system and at least a portion of the data may be stored for subsequent evaluation utilizing the model. In other embodiments data may be acquired in a just in time manner when desired for processing. The predictive model may be utilized to evaluate any number of components of the data including but not limited to an account balance a sum of the balances of multiple accounts increases and or decreases in one or more account balances percentage increases and or decreases in one or more account balances timing associated with account withdrawals deposits and or fees e.g. a time since a last deposit or fee etc. credit extended to the customer etc. In one example embodiment the predictive model may identify and evaluate attributes of the data that have been determined to be significant indicators of attrition risk. In this regard the predictive model may calculate an attrition risk for the customer. In certain embodiments the predictive model may evaluate account activity patterns irrespective of the actual or potential incidence of fees. As a result of examining a variety of account relationships and activities other than simply the charging of fees a predictive model may identify an attrition risk that may otherwise go undetected.

One example mathematical calculation that may be utilized to determine or calculate an attrition risk will now be described however a wide variety of other calculations may be utilized. Any number of predictors may be utilized in association with an attrition model and the mathematical calculation such as the predictors set forth below 

A wide variety of other predictors and or predictor ranges may be utilized as desired. Additionally the illustrated weights for the predictors and predictor ranges are representative and in certain embodiments may be determined as a result of statistical modeling of historical data. As desired the attrition risk for a customer may be calculated utilizing the predictor ranges set forth in Table 1 above as well as customer values for the various predictors. For example an attrition risk P e.g. a risk that a customer will close an account etc. may be calculated in accordance with equation one 1 below 

A wide variety of different formats may be utilized to represent a determined attrition risk. For example an attrition risk may be represented as a probability value in the range of zero to one or as a score within some other range of possible values. In certain embodiments once a pre notice attrition risk has been determined for the customer the determined pre notice attrition risk may be stored. In this regard the determined attrition risk may be utilized in association with subsequent processing for the customer.

At block a determination may be made as to whether the calculated pre notice attrition risk for the selected customer satisfies one or more pre notice attrition risk thresholds such as the first threshold described above with reference to block of . In other words prior to the communication of a migration notice to the selected customer a determination may be made as to whether the attrition risk for the selected customer exceeds an acceptable level of risk specified by the financial institution or a service provider . If it is determined at block that the pre notice attrition risk satisfies one or more pre notice attrition risk thresholds then operations may continue at block .

At block the financial institution may transmit or direct the transmission of a product migration notice to the selected customer. A wide variety of suitable methods and or techniques may be utilized to transmit the notice. For example a notice may be transmitted via email regular snail mail short message service SMS messaging automated phone messaging and or various in application messaging via an online application e.g. messaging via an online electronic banking application messaging via an online EBPP application or a dedicated application e.g. a dedicated banking application etc. . In certain embodiments the financial institution may generate and transmit the product migration notice. For example if the financial institution hosts electronic banking and or EBPP services the financial institution may generate and transmit the notice. In other embodiments the financial institution may provide a generated notice to another entity for transmission or the financial institution may direct or request another entity to generate and transmit the notice.

As desired in various embodiments a wide variety of different types of information may be included in the generated migration notice and or referenced by a migration notice e.g. referenced by a hyperlink etc. . Examples of suitable information that may be included in and or referenced by the notice include but are not limited to an identification of a target product to which the customer has been assigned one or more criteria associated with the target product e.g. fee information services associated with and or encompassed by the target product customer requirements associated with the target product etc. an identification of a current product that the customer is receiving criteria associated with the current product and or a date e.g. 30 days out 60 days out etc. at which migration to the target product will occur. Once transmission of the migration notice has been directed at block operations may continue at block and a next customer may be selected from the sample for evaluation.

If however it is determined at block that the pre notice attrition risk fails to satisfy one or more pre notice attrition risk thresholds then operations may continue at block . As desired prior to proceeding to block the selected customer may be removed from the sample of customers. In this regard the likelihood of customer attrition may be reduced. As desired in certain embodiments various parameters associated with the customer may be reevaluated and the customer may be assigned to a different target product. At block a determination may be made as to whether the size of the sample should be increased in order to complete the product migration test. In other words with the elimination of the customer from the sample the size of the sample may be examined in order to determine whether it will still produce statistically significant results or otherwise function as an indicator associated with migration of a set of customers to the target product. In certain embodiments the size of the sample may be compared to one or more threshold size values. In other embodiments the size of the sample may be evaluated utilizing one or more statistical techniques in order to determine whether a desired confidence level can be achieved with respect to the sample. If it is determined at block that the size of the sample does not need to be increased then operations may continue at block and another customer may be selected from the sample for evaluation.

If however it is determined at block that the size of the sample should be increased then operations may continue at block . At block an additional customer may be selected from the set of customers assigned to the target product for inclusion in the sample. In certain embodiments any customers previously selected for the sample and or any other samples in the event that products and or assignments have been modified may be excluded from the selection process. Operations may then continue at block and another customer may be selected from the sample for evaluation. In this regard pre notice attrition risk may be evaluated for each of the customers included in the sample or a modified sample .

Following the transmission of migration notices to the customers included in a sample of customers a product migration test process may be utilized to conduct additional evaluations on the customers. For example post notice attrition risks may be determined or calculated for each of the customers included in the sample and a determination may be made as to whether the attrition risks following transmission of the notices remain at an acceptable level. The post notice evaluation process may be performed at any point in time following the transmission of the migration notices. For example the post notice evaluation process may be performed approximately 30 days to approximately 45 days or at any other time interval following the transmission of the notices. Additionally in certain embodiments the evaluation process may be performed prior to the migration date specified by the notices.

At block a sample of customers such as a subset of customers assigned to a target product or alternative financial product may be identified. The sample of customers may be a sample to which migration notices were previously transmitted. Additionally at block a next customer included in the sample or subset of customers may be selected for evaluation. At block a determination may be made as to whether the end of the sample has been reached. If it is determined at block that the end of the sample has not been reached then operations may continue at block . At block a post notice attrition risk may be calculated for the selected customer. In certain embodiments the post notice attrition risk may be a current attrition risk for the selected customer. A wide variety of suitable methods techniques algorithms formulas and or models may be utilized as desired to calculate or determine a post notice attrition risk. In certain embodiments these attrition risk calculation techniques may be similar to those described above with reference to block illustrated in .

At block a change in the attrition risk of the customer may be calculated or determined based at least in part upon the post notice attrition risk and the previously determined pre notice attrition risk for the selected customer. In one example embodiment the pre notice attrition risk may be accessed from memory or obtained from an external data source. The difference between the pre notice attrition risk and the post notice attrition risk for the customer may then be calculated or determined. In certain embodiments the calculated difference may be referred to as a risk delta. Additionally it should be noted that the difference between the pre notice risk and the post notice risk may either be positive or negative. In other words the attrition risk may increase or decrease. Once the change in attrition risk for the customer is determined at block operations may continue at block and a next customer may be selected from the sample or subset for evaluation.

If however it is determined at block that the end of the sample has been reached then operations may continue at block . At block an average risk delta for the subset may be calculated or determined as the sum of the respective risk deltas calculated for the various customers in the sample divided by the number of customers included in the sample. In other embodiments a median risk delta or some other representative attrition risk may be determined. Alternatively a wide variety of different types of attrition risks that are representative of the subset of customers may be calculated or determined.

At block a determination may be made as to whether the average risk delta or a representative attrition risk for the sample satisfies one or more risk deltas or average change thresholds such as the second threshold described above with reference to block of . For example a determination may be made as to whether the average risk delta exceeds a risk delta threshold. In this regard based upon the product migration testing performed on a subset of a set of customers assigned to the target product a determination may be made as to whether the entire set of customers should be migrated to the target product. If it is determined at block that the average risk delta satisfies the one or more risk delta thresholds e.g. the average risk delta does not exceed a risk delta threshold then operations may continue at block . At block the risk associated with a migration of the set of customers to the target product may be identified as an acceptable risk. If however it is determined at block that the average risk delta does not satisfy one or more risk delta thresholds e.g. the average risk delta exceeds a risk delta threshold then operations may continue at block . At block the risk associated with a migration of the set of customers to the target product may be identified as an unacceptable risk. Operations of the method may end following either block or block .

In addition to evaluating risks that are representative of a set of customers assigned to a target product e.g. an average risk delta etc. in certain embodiments market research may be performed for the sample or subset of customers for which product migration testing was conducted. For example the results of customer questionnaires and or surveys may be collected and evaluated in order to determine customer feedback and or customer satisfaction associated with a product migration or a proposed product migration. As desired the market research may be evaluated in order to determine whether a migration should be performed with respect to a target product.

Additionally in certain embodiments one or more predictive models or other desired calculation techniques may be utilized to identify or predict a respective future or expected value for each customer included in the sample or subset. Similarly a respective revenue potential for each customer may be calculated. A future value or revenue potential may take a wide variety of different factors into account such as expected interest income and or expected fee income associated with migrating the customer to the target product. In certain embodiments an expected value and or revenue potential may be evaluated in conjunction with calculated attrition risks and or risk deltas in order to determine whether to proceed with a migration of a set of customers from an existing financial product to an alternative or target financial product. Indeed a wide variety of suitable evaluations may be performed in association with product migration testing in order to determine whether a full migration should be completed. Additionally the results of one or more of these evaluations may be utilized to modify and or optimize product parameters or characteristics and or customer assignments.

In the event that an attrition risk associated with the migration of a set of customers to an alternative product is determined to be acceptable a mass migration to the alternative product which may be a modified or adjusted product may be directed and or performed by a financial system. In certain embodiments an entity or system that conducts product migration testing may also perform and or carry out the mass migration. For example a financial institution system may perform product migration testing and a subsequent mass migration based upon a determination that a calculated attrition risk is acceptable. In other embodiments the entity or system that conducts product migration testing may direct or request another entity to perform the mass migration. For example a financial service provider may request a financial institution and or another service provider system to perform the mass migration. In doing so a wide variety of suitable information e.g. alternative product definitions customer assignment information etc. may be provided to the other entity.

At block a set of customers assigned to an alternative or target product may be identified. Additionally at block a next customer included in the set of customers may be selected for evaluation and or communication of a product migration notice. At block a determination may be made as to whether the end of the set has been reached. If it is determined at block that the end of the set has been reached then operations may end. If however it is determined at block that the end of the set has not been reached then operations may continue at block .

At block the transmission of a product migration notice to the selected customer may be directed and or performed. As desired if the selected customer was previously involved in a pre migration test then a product migration notice may not be transmitted to the selected customer. A wide variety of suitable methods and or techniques may be utilized to transmit a notice. For example a notice may be transmitted via email regular snail mail short message service SMS messaging and or various in application messaging via an online application e.g. messaging via an online electronic banking application messaging via an online EBPP application or a dedicated application e.g. a dedicated banking application etc. . In certain embodiments a financial institution may generate and transmit the product migration notice. For example if the financial institution hosts electronic banking and or EBPP services the financial institution may generate and transmit the notice. In other embodiments the financial institution may provide a generated notice to another entity for transmission or the financial institution may direct or request another entity to generate and transmit the notice.

As desired in various embodiments a wide variety of different types of information may be included in the generated migration notice. Examples of suitable information that may be included in the notice include but are not limited to an identification of a target product to which the selected customer will be migrated one or more criteria associated with the target product e.g. fee information services associated with and or encompassed by the target product customer requirements associated with the target product etc. an identification of a current product that the customer is receiving criteria associated with the current product and or a date e.g. 30 days out 60 days out etc. at which migration to the target product will occur. Once transmission of the migration notice has been directed at block operations may continue at block and a next customer may be selected from the set of customers for evaluation and notice transmission.

Additionally although the sequential transmission of migration notices is described in certain embodiments any number of migration notices may be transmitted in parallel. In other embodiments migration notices may be selectively transmitted based upon predetermined events. For example when a customer logs into an electronic banking application a product migration notice may be transmitted to a customer device.

In certain embodiments following the transmission of a product migration notice to a customer a wide variety of different types of post notice and or post migration processing may be performed with respect to the customer. In this regard a determination may be made as to whether attrition mitigation should be performed on behalf of the customer. illustrates a flow diagram of an example method for conducting risk mitigation in association with a product migration according to an illustrative embodiment of the disclosure. The method may be performed by any number of suitable systems and or associated computers such as the financial service provider system and or associated financial service provider computers illustrated in the financial institution system s and or financial institution computers illustrated in or the service provider system s and or service provider computers illustrated in . The method may begin at block .

At block a customer who has previously received a product migration notice may be identified. In certain embodiments the customer may be identified subsequent to the transmission of a migration notice and prior to migration. In other embodiments the customer may be identified subsequent to a migration. A wide variety of suitable methods and or techniques may be utilized as desired in various embodiments to identify a customer for evaluation. For example various customers may be periodically evaluated and or evaluated in accordance with a predetermined schedule. As another example customers may be randomly selected for evaluation following the transmission of migration notices to a set of customers. As yet another example a relatively high value customer may be identified for evaluation. As yet another example a customer may be identified in response to certain customer behavior. In other words a determination may be made that a customer has exhibited a particular kind of behavior and the customer may be identified for evaluation based at least in part upon the determination. As one example the customer may be identified in the event that the customer has requested closure of an account or if the customer has provided a negative review and or complaint associated with an alternative financial product.

Once a customer has been identified at block operations may continue at block . At block a post notice or post migration attrition risk may be calculated for the identified customer. In certain embodiments the post notice or post migration attrition risk may be a current attrition risk for the customer. A wide variety of suitable methods techniques algorithms formulas and or models may be utilized as desired to calculate or determine a post notice or post migration attrition risk. In certain embodiments these attrition risk calculation techniques may be similar to those described above with reference to block illustrated in .

At block a determination may be made as to whether the calculated post notice or post migration attrition risk for the identified customer exceeds one or more attrition risk thresholds associated with attrition mitigation such as the third threshold described above with reference to block of . In other words a determination may be made as to whether the current attrition risk of the customer qualifies the customer for one or more risk mitigation activities. For example a determination may be made as to whether the current attrition risk exceeds a threshold associated with attrition mitigation. Additionally in certain embodiments other attributes associated with the customer such as a customer value a customer segmentation and or expected revenue associated with the customer may be evaluated in order to determine whether attrition mitigation should be performed.

If it is determined at block that the attrition risk does not exceed one or more thresholds associated with attrition mitigation then operations may end. If however it is determined at block that the attrition risk exceeds one or more thresholds associated with attrition mitigation then operations may continue at block . At block any number of customer handling processes may be invoked and or directed in order to mitigate the attrition risk associated with the customer. The customer handling processes may include any number of automated processes human driven or manual processes and or any combination of automated and manual processes. In this regard an attempt to retain the customer may be carried out. Additionally as set forth above other customer attributes and or customer information may be analyzed e.g. customer value etc. in order to determine whether customer retention is desired.

A wide variety of attrition mitigation and or retention procedures and or techniques may be utilized as desired in various embodiments of the invention. For example the customer may be assigned to a different financial product such as a financial product that will result in a lower attrition risk for the customer. As another example one or more parameters of a financial product to which the customer is assigned may be modified. In this regard a product may be tailored for the customer. As yet another example one or more special offers and or discounts may be offered to the customer. Other procedures and or techniques will be appreciated. Operations may then end following the performance of one or more attrition mitigation procedures at block . As desired an identifier of the customer may be stored to facilitate a subsequent evaluation of the customer. In this regard the effectiveness of the mitigation procedure s may be evaluated.
