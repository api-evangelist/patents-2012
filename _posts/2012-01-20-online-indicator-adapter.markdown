Embodiments of the invention relate to systems and methods for communications among the devices in a computerized network. More particularly an embodiment of the invention relates to systems and methods that facilitate communications among various computer peripheral devices.

Unified communications represents an important aspect of productivity in contemporary business culture and its success from company to company can serve as a bellwether indication of the company s overall management success. An essential feature behind unified communications is the ability to have a single way for reaching an employee. Thus in a fully configured unified communications environment all messages to an employee regardless of the format of their origin e.g. e mail will reach the employee at the earliest possible moment via another format e.g. SMS if necessary.

Unified communications may include the integration of real time communication services e.g. instant messaging with non real time communication services e.g. SMS . Unified communications systems typically comprise not a single system but the integration of data from a potentially unlimited set of separate communications devices and systems.

As a further representative example unified communications permit one party e.g. a co worker to send a message on one medium and have it received by another party on another medium. This process effectively transfers an activity from one communications medium to another. For example a message recipient could receive an e mail message from a co worker and access it through a mobile phone.

Presence information refers to the combination of the availability of a communication recipient to receive a message and that person s willingness to speak. For example if the message sender is online according to the presence information and currently accepts calls the response can be sent immediately through text chat or video call. Otherwise the communication may be sent as a non real time message that can be accessed through a variety of media. Thus presence information typically represents a status indicator that conveys the availability and willingness of a potential communication partner.

Difficulties arise in producing a unified view of data such as presence information when a party s communication media are spread across multiple and or overlapping systems. When a user s communications environment comprises multiple devices not all of which are aware of the others then the unity among the devices of the user s communications network is incomplete. So for example a party s laptop computer might not know about the same user s mobile telephone. Consequently the mobile telephone is not joined into the same effective communications network as the other devices associated with the laptop computer and a presence system cannot integrate the mobile phone into the unified communications environment.

Signaling a user s availability status to the coworkers in his immediate vicinity is also an important element in modern communications. It may matter little how sophisticated a presence system operates if the user s co workers do not know that he is engaged in a conversation and interrupt him. For this reason online indicators OLIs have become popular. OLIs can take many forms but the most common form is a lighted device that stands somewhere near the user s desk. When illuminated the light signals that the user is engaged in a conversation and when out the light indicates the user s presence and potential availability for interruption.

Automatic phone lifters also provide critical support for modern communications. A phone lifter is a device configured to lift the physical handset on a conventional hard phone to engage a call. Lifters may provide their greatest benefits when operating in conjunction with headsets. This combination allows a user to answer or place a call using buttons associated with his headset or computer with corresponding actions mimicked by the manual lifter on the physical telephone.

Unified communications has analogs in the home consumer market. A home user may want to watch a television program surf the Internet or play a game uninterrupted. The home user may be able control devices e.g. a wired telephone associated with the home cable network to implement the desired message routing but this home cable network has little control over interruptions coming from outside this equipment configuration.

Attempts to solve these problems in the prior art have tended to be either overly complicated overly expensive or both. To further complicate matters many corporations now employ softphones in their corporate networks. Softphones are typically computer programs that facilitate audio and or audiovisual conversations. For internal calls softphones may operate over some form of local area network such as an Ethernet. Softphones may even be configured to provide telephone communications outside the company such as via the Internet. Calls that arise outside the conventional hard phone installation on the user s workstation may not necessarily communicate with equipment associated only or primarily with the hard phone. Equipment falling into this category includes many conventional OLIs. A simple and robust solution is called for that makes unified communications more robust and ubiquitous and unites the elements of the user s communication system and its related equipment.

Embodiments of the invention provide a dongle adapter that comprises a first connection configured for communications using a first communications protocol wherein the first connection is attachable to a computing device configured for communications according to the first communications protocol. The dongle adapter also comprises a second connection configured for communications using a second communications protocol wherein the second connection is attachable to a peripheral device configured for communications according to the second communications protocol and the dongle adapter further comprises a translator configured to receive commands from the computing device formatted according to the first communications protocol translate the received commands into the second communications protocol and send the translated commands to the peripheral device. The translator is further configured to translate commands received from the peripheral device formatted according to the second communications protocol translate the received commands into the first communications protocol and send the translated commands to the computing device.

Embodiments of the invention comprise a dongle adapter that configures a first connection for communications using a first communications protocol wherein the first connection is attached to a computing device configured for communications according to the first communications protocol. The dongle adapter further comprises configuring a second connection on the dongle adapter for communications using a second communications protocol wherein the second connection is attached to a peripheral device configured for communications according to the second communications protocol. The dongle adaptor also comprises receiving commands in a translator associated with the dongle adapter from the computing device formatted according to the first communications protocol translating the commands by the translator into the second communications protocol and sending the translated commands to the peripheral device. The translator also receives commands in the translator from the peripheral device formatted according to the second communications protocol translates the received commands into the first communications protocol and sends the translated commands to the computing device.

Embodiments of the invention enable a conventional online indicator OLI configured organically for communications in a first protocol to communicate with other devices in a computerized system where the other devices have been configured for communication via a second communications protocol. For example the computerized system may employ a well known standard such as the Universal Serial Bus USB for the communications among its peripheral devices while the OLI may communicate according to a different communications protocol according to an embodiment of the invention. The OLI s communications protocol may be a proprietary one associated with its manufacturer for example.

Conventional OLIs have often been designed to communicate using proprietary protocols. Consequently these OLIs have limitations in terms of how readily they may integrate and communicate with other devices employed in the same workstation installation. A conventional OLI is typically plugged into a conventional telephone where the telephone has typically been manufactured to operate according to the same communications protocol as the OLI and where the protocol may even be a proprietary one with few or no open interfaces. In some conventional configurations the light on a conventional OLI might not activate when other devices such as a lifter are not also employed. Thus embodiments of the invention provide a solution to this problem by permitting a conventional OLI to be used in conjunction with devices operating on a different communications protocol such as a USB headset and a conventional softphone application without requiring modification of the conventional OLI.

USB is an industry standard that defines communications protocols as well as the connectors and cables used in a bus for communication as well as connection and power supply between computers and peripheral devices. USB has been used to standardize the connection of computer peripherals such as keyboards pointing devices digital cameras printers portable media players disk drives and network adapters as well as smartphones PDAs and video game consoles.

Instead of using a well known communications protocol such as USB the OLI s organic communications protocol may employ an Accessory Interface Bus AIB according to an embodiment of the invention. The AIB provides similar functionality to a communications protocol like USB but just employs its protocol in a different manner. The AIB itself may constitute a proprietary protocol such as the Plantronics Serial Bus PSB according to an embodiment of the invention. The PSB like the USB protocol is intended for controlling and monitoring many types of accessory devices including those currently fielded as well as ones that may become available in the future which are configured for or easily adapted to coupling with the PSB. In some embodiments the PSB provides a positive unregulated high voltage rail V used as a power line for providing power to the accessories coupled to the PSB a low voltage rail V used as a ground line and at least one signaling line for transferring communications. The signaling line may be a bi directional signaling line although two or more signaling lines may be used where each of these lines may be either unidirectional or bi directional. Embodiments of the PSB operate as a multi master type bus with unique addressing wherein accessories connect to the PSB in parallel and are assigned a unique bus address. Embodiments of the PSB may employ a communications packet protocol for transmitting command data back and forth over the PSB. Further information about an embodiment of the PSB may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7 633 963 entitled Accessory Interface Bus for Telephone Headset Adapter co owned with the present application by Plantronics Inc. and which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Embodiments of the invention comprise a dongle adapter configured to communicate in a first direction using a first communications protocol such as that of a conventional OLI that operates according to a specialized protocol and to communicate in a second direction using a second communications protocol such as USB. Thus embodiments of the invention may employ proprietary communications software like the PSB for operation of the OLI while providing interoperability with various softphone clients using non proprietary software.

A telephony workstation associated with an embodiment of the invention comprises a headset wired or wireless a softphone application and an OLI. However many other telecommunications devices could be used with the telephone workstation system. The headset may also include a headset adapter for USB communications if the headset has not been designed for USB communications according to an embodiment of the invention. The workstation may also comprise additional equipment such as a conventional telephone and a handset lifter. The telephony workstation may be coupled to a communication network such as the Ethernet the Internet and or the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN .

The workstation system further includes an online indicator OLI configured to indicate when the user s headset is engaged in a phone conversation provided by the softphone application on the computer according to an embodiment of the invention. The OLI lets others know when the user has engaged the headset in a telephone conversation using a softphone application such as the softphone application shown in . A light on the OLI illuminates when the user has engaged the call and lets others know that the user is occupied with a telephony task. The user has placed the OLI on her computer monitor where the light may be more visible to colleagues passing by her work area. Once her colleagues have been trained to pay attention to the light they are less likely to disrupt her telephone calls. The OLI is typically easy to use and may significantly reduce the number of calls that are interrupted.

The OLI may operate according to a conventional design and provide an indication of online status via a number of mechanisms such as by having lights that become illuminated when the user is on the telephone e.g. the light is illuminated . The lights may be configured to have different colors to indicate different communication statuses and other means may be provided to indicate that the user is engaged and unavailable according to embodiment of the invention. The OLI shown in has been designed to receive power and commands via a cord connected to the computer . However the OLI could be designed to operate wirelessly and or via another power source e.g. battery power .

The OLI communicates with the headset via a dongle adapter according to an embodiment of the invention. The dongle adapter connects to a port on the computer . The port operates according to a communications protocol such as USB that is different from the communications protocol of the OLI . The dongle adapter is also configured to receive the utility cord from the OLI at a connection according to an embodiment of the invention. The dongle adapter translates commands formatted for communications via the port e.g. the USB protocol into commands associated with the protocol of the OLI e.g. such as an AIB which may be a proprietary protocol like the PSB . Similarly the dongle adapter also translates commands formatted in the communications protocol employed by the OLI into commands formatted according to the communications protocol used at the port . Thus the OLI itself may be of a conventional design that communicates only via a specialized AIB protocol yet still sends and receives communications from the computer because of the presence of the dongle adapter according to an embodiment of the invention. The dongle adapter may be configured for operations with accessory devices beyond the OLI according to an alternative embodiment of the invention.

The softphone application sends and receives communications that travel along a computer bus and some of these communications may be routed through ports and . As shown in the port is associated with a headset and the port is associated with a dongle adapter according to an embodiment of the invention. The bus operates as a conventional computer bus and the protocols associated with the ports and are compatible with the computer s busing protocol e.g. the ports and are configured to operate according to the USB protocol. Additional communications beyond those of the software application may transpire over the bus and may involve the ports and as appropriate. For example communications between the headset and the computer may provide the headset with a source of power. The dongle adapter may also be configured to request power from the computer via the bus for the adapter s own operations and or for an OLI according to an embodiment of the invention.

The telephony workstation system includes the headset that may communicate with the softphone application such as when the user is engaged in a phone conversation. The headset communicates through the port using a conventional protocol e.g. USB . The headset may operate internally in a proprietary communications protocol. As shown in a translator may accept internal communications from the headset and translate them into a protocol acceptable for transmission through the port according to an embodiment of the invention. The translator is likely not needed if the headset has been designed to communicate according to the same protocol as the port . Whether or not the headset includes a translator e.g. the translator the headset communicates with the softphone application via the port according to an embodiment of the invention. The headset may connect directly into the port as shown in or may communicate with the port via a dongle such as the headset adaptor shown in .

The telephony workstation system includes the OLI . The OLI may be of a conventional design and the OLI may be configured only for communications in a proprietary protocol e.g. the PSB . A dongle adapter includes a translator configured to accept commands in the proprietary communications language of the OLI and translate them into a communications protocol suitable for transmission to the port e.g. the USB protocol according to an embodiment of the invention.

The translator may employ the Human Interface Device HID Class USB protocol in communications between the telephony workstation and the OLI according to an embodiment of the invention. The translator may convert commands received from the telephony workstation formatted in the USB HID protocol into commands and protocols utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB. The translator may also convert various status and event messages utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB into HID protocol status and event messages and post these messages to the telephony workstation according to an embodiment of the invention.

Using the telephony workstation system a communication could originate from the headset in the AIB protocol be translated into the USB protocol by the translator and sent to the computer where it ultimately is received by the dongle adapter and translated by the translator back into the AIB protocol according to an embodiment of the invention. Similarly messages could be communicated through the softphone to the OLI and vice versa.

In the telephony workstation system for example a message could be transmitted from the headset or from the softphone that the user was engaged in a phone conversation and accordingly a light in the OLI should be illuminated e.g. the light shown in according to an embodiment of the invention. One exemplary communications sequence would have a call related signal going from the softphone to the headset via the bus and the port and then having the headset send a signal via the port the bus and the port to the dongle that instructed the OLI to turn on its light according to an embodiment of the invention.

The OLI may not typically be configured to light automatically when audio is being provided to the headset from a non telephonic source such as streaming media according to an embodiment of the invention. The OLI could be configured for manual lighting in such non telephonic situations according to an embodiment of the invention. The manual lighting could be engaged externally to the OLI such as from the headset according to an embodiment of the invention.

Assume for example that a conventional standalone OLI such as the OLI shown in has a 3.5 mm jack or plug . This size may have been selected for interoperability with other proprietary equipment by the manufacturer of the OLI for example. Thus the connection would be configured to accept a 3.5 mm jack. For example the dongle adapter may comprise a standalone OLI adapter with a 3.5 mm jack configured to connect with conventional Plantronics Online Indicators using Plantronics serial bus and also configured to plug into a conventional USB port according to an embodiment of the invention. In an alternative embodiment of the invention a headset adapter could be configured to accept both a headset and an OLI according to an alternative embodiment of the invention.

The translator may employ the Human Interface Device HID Class USB protocol in communications transpiring over the USB connection according to an embodiment of the invention. The translator may convert commands received over the connection formatted in the USB HID protocol into commands and protocols utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB and transmitted over the connection . The translator may also convert various status and event messages utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB into HID protocol status and event messages and post these messages over the connection according to an embodiment of the invention.

Assume a user has inserted the dongle adapter e.g. the dongle adapter shown in into a port on a computer e.g. the port on the computer shown in . The dongle adapter receives an appropriate introductory communication step from the computer via the USB port e.g. the port shown in . The dongle adapter sends an appropriate introductory communication step to the computer through the USB port according to an embodiment of the invention.

The dongle adapter checks step to see if an OLI has been plugged into its OLI jack e.g. the connection shown in . If the dongle adapter finds that an OLI has not been plugged into the OLI jack step then the dongle adapter enters a waiting state and performs the OLI jack check again. If the dongle adapter finds that an OLI has been plugged into the OLI jack step then the dongle adapter sends step an appropriate message to the computer according to an embodiment of the invention. In some embodiments of the invention the dongle adapter s connection message may cause the computer to provide services e.g. power to the OLI.

Once the dongle adapter has been connected to both a computer and an OLI then if the dongle adapter receives a message in a protocol associated with the computer step then the dongle adapter translates step the message into an appropriate protocol for the OLI. The dongle adapter then sends the translated message to the OLI. Conversely if the dongle adapter receives a message step in the Auxiliary Interface Bus AIB format of the OLI e.g. the format used by the PSB then the dongle adapter translates step the message into an appropriate protocol for the computer. The dongle adapter then sends the translated message to the computer.

The translator in the dongle adapter may employ the Human Interface Device HID Class USB protocol in communications between the computer and the OLI according to an embodiment of the invention. The translator may convert commands received from the computer formatted in the USB HID protocol into commands and protocols utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB. The translator may also convert various status and event messages utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB into HID protocol status and event messages and post these messages to the computer according to an embodiment of the invention.

The dongle adapter continues its operations until either the computer is powered down or until the dongle adapter is disconnected from the computer and or the OLI is disconnected from the dongle adapter. For many embodiments the dongle adapter will not have a power supply of its own and may simply stop operating when the dongle adapter is removed from the computer.

Telephony workstations may have multiple duties e.g. technical support offices and include various peripheral devices. These peripheral devices may include a handset lifter that reduces answering the telephone to a single button push e.g. either on the headset and or on the computer keyboard . As previously discussed a workstation is typically equipped with a softphone application that provides telephony features. A suitable softphone may comprise an MS Telephony client and or a generic softphone application such as Skype. The telephony workstation may even be located in a facility such as a call center that contains many telephony workstations that communicate using the Ethernet such as the Ethernet shown in . Some corporations even configure their telephony facilities so as to provide communications among offices around the world.

The headset has been configured to operate with a desk phone according to an embodiment of the invention. The phone includes a handset lifter . The headset lifter allows the user to answer incoming calls with just the push of a button on either the headset and or the computer keyboard according to an embodiment of the invention. When the user answers the phone then the lifter raises a handset on the phone making the telephone temporarily unable to receive new phone calls. The headset lifter also works when engaged in softphone calls via the computer .

The headset is connected wirelessly to the computer . The headset adapter connects to a port e.g. a port configured for USB communications on the computer and transmits commands and data between the headset and the computer . The computer includes a softphone application such as the softphone application shown in that provides telephonic communications over a communications medium such as an Ethernet the Internet and or the wired telephony network e.g. the communications network shown in . The computer may also include other computing equipment such as a monitor and other conventional software applications. A suitable softphone application may comprise a specialized or proprietary telephony program and or a generic softphone application such as Skype. TAPI provides a representative proprietary telephony program.

The telephony workstation system further includes an online indicator OLI configured to indicate when the user s headset is engaged in a phone conversation provided by the softphone application on the computer according to an embodiment of the invention. The OLI lets others know when the user has engaged the headset in a telephone conversation using a softphone application such as the softphone application shown in . A light on the OLI illuminates when the user has engaged the call and lets others know that the user is occupied with a telephony task.

The OLI may operate according to a conventional design and provide an indication of online status via a number of mechanisms such as by having lights that become illuminated when the user is on the telephone. The OLI has been designed to receive power and commands via a cord connected to the computer . However the OLI could be designed to operate wirelessly and or via another power source e.g. battery power .

The OLI communicates with the headset via a dongle adapter according to an embodiment of the invention. The dongle adapter connects to a port on the computer . The port operates according to a communications protocol such as USB that is different from the communications protocol of the OLI . The dongle adapter is also configured to receive the utility cord from the OLI according to an embodiment of the invention. The dongle adapter translates commands formatted for communications via the port e.g. the USB protocol into commands associated with the protocol of the OLI such as an AIB which may be a proprietary protocol like the PSB. Similarly the dongle adapter also translates commands formatted in the communications protocol employed by the OLI into commands formatted according to the communications protocol used by the port . Thus the OLI itself may be of a conventional design that communicates only via a proprietary protocol yet still sends and receives communications via the computer because of the presence of the dongle adapter according to an embodiment of the invention. The dongle adapter may be configured for operations with accessory devices beyond the OLI according to an alternative embodiment of the invention.

The softphone application has been configured to communicate via a bus configured for communications via a protocol such as USB. Using the bus the softphone may send communications to an online indicator and a headset according to an embodiment of the invention. The headset may communicate directly to a lifter using an AIB communications protocol such as PSB.

The headset may similarly communicate to the online indicator using the AIB protocol however the headset first needs to translate the command from the AIB protocol to a universal protocol such as USB. Thus the headset formulates communications with a port that provides communications according to a conventional protocol such as USB. Once the communication has been received at the port it may be transmitted to the softphone application and or it may be communicated to the online indicator according an embodiment of the invention. The communication to the online indicator needs to be translated from the USB protocol into the AIB protocol. The dongle adapter includes a translator that provides the translation from one protocol to another.

The translator may employ the Human Interface Device HID Class USB protocol in communications between the computer and the OLI according to an embodiment of the invention. The translator may convert commands received via the port from the computer formatted in the USB HID protocol into commands and protocols utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB. The translator may also convert various status and event messages utilized by the AIB protocol e.g. the PSB into HID protocol status and event messages and post these messages to the computer via the port according to an embodiment of the invention.

The softphone application sends and receives communications that travel along a computer bus and some of these communications may be routed through the ports and . As shown in the port is associated with the headset and the port is associated with a dongle adapter according to an embodiment of the invention. The bus operates as a conventional computer bus and the protocols associated with the ports and are compatible with the computer s busing protocol e.g. the ports and are configured to operate according to the USB protocol. Additional communications beyond those of the software application may transpire over the bus and may involve the ports and as appropriate. For example the headset may send communications that provide the headset with a source of power according to an embodiment of the invention. The dongle adapter may also be configured to request power from the computer via the bus for the adapter s own operations and or for an OLI .

The telephony workstation system includes the headset that may communicate with the softphone application such as when the user is engaged in a phone conversation. The headset communicates through the port using a conventional protocol e.g. USB . The headset may operate internally in an AIB protocol which may be proprietary. As shown in a translator may accept internal communications from the headset and translate them into a protocol acceptable for transmission through the port according to an embodiment of the invention. The translator is likely not needed if the headset has been designed to communicate according to the same protocol as the port . Whether the headset includes a translator e.g. the translator the headset communicates with the softphone application via the port according to an embodiment of the invention.

The workstation system includes the OLI . The OLI may be of a conventional design and the OLI may be configured only for communications in an AIB protocol e.g. the PSB . A dongle adapter includes a translator configured to accept commands formatted in the AIB protocol of the OLI and translate them into a communications protocol suitable for transmission to the port e.g. the USB protocol according to an embodiment of the invention.

Using the telephony workstation system a communication could originate from the headset in the AIB protocol be translated into the USB language by the translator and sent to the computer where it ultimately is received by the dongle adapter and translated by the translator back into the AIB protocol according to an embodiment of the invention. Similarly messages could be communicated through the softphone to the OLI and vice versa.

In the workstation system for example a message could be transmitted from the headset or from the softphone that the user was engaged in a phone conversation and accordingly a light in the OLI should be illuminated e.g. the light shown in according to an embodiment of the invention. One exemplary communications sequence would have a call related signal going from the softphone to the headset via the bus and the port and then having the headset send a signal via the port the bus and the port to the dongle that instructed the OLI to turn on its light.

The OLI may not typically be configured to light automatically when audio is provided to the headset from a non telephonic source such as streaming media according to an embodiment of the invention. The OLI could be configured for manual lighting in such non telephonic situations according to an embodiment of the invention. The manual lighting could be engaged externally to the OLI such as from the headset according to an embodiment of the invention.

The translator used in various embodiments of the invention may be comprised of software and or hardware. For example the translator may be comprised of a memory device such as PROM configured to include all the mappings from the proprietary language to the USB protocol and vice versa.

While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described it will be clear that the invention is not limited to these embodiments only. Embodiments of the invention discussed herein have generally been described using Plantronics equipment e.g. headsets and OLIs however the invention may be adapted for use with equipment from other sources and manufacturers. Headsets used in conjunction with the invention may be configured to operate according to a conventional computer protocol e.g. USB and or may be configured to operate according to a specialized protocol e.g. a Plantronics serial bus and communicate to the computer using a specialized interface similar to the translator provided here for the OLI. Similarly a single dongle adapter could be employed for multiple devices operating in a computerized system but using an AIB such as PSB. Apart from an additional routing configuration such a multiple device dongle adapter would need to have a translator or multiple translators that could translate commands for all the proprietary devices to which the dongle adapter could be connected. Numerous modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described in the claims. In general in the following claims the terms used should not be construed to limit the invention to the specific embodiments disclosed in the specification but should be construed to include all systems and methods that operate under the claims set forth hereinbelow.
