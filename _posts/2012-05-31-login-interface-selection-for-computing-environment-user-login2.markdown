title: Login interface selection for computing environment user login
abstract: A device may provide a login process to authenticate users prior to admittance to a computing environment. The device may also enable users to adjust various the computing environment, e.g., the language selected for communicating with the user and the user interfaces to be presented to the user, and may store such adjustments in a secured user account. However, if the user account is inaccessible to the device during the login process, the device is unable to adapt the login process to apply the user's adjustments. Instead, the device may be configured to store users' adjustments (including language selection) outside of the user accounts, and to, upon identifying the user during the login process, present login interfaces specified in the user account. Additionally, users may select different login interfaces during login, and the device may retrieve these login interfaces for selection during future login processes for the same user.

In the field of computing many scenarios involve a presentation of a login interface for a user to complete a login process. For example a device may present a textbox pair to receive a username and a password or a numeric keypad to enter a numeric passcode. The device may compare the text entry to authentication credentials stored in the user s profile and in the event of a match may admit the user to the computing environment.

As another aspect in the field of computing many scenarios involve the configuration of a device to support variations in the computing environment to suit the interests of the user. For example the user may select a language from among a set of available languages and may communicate with the user within the computing environment using a selected language. In addition to translating text to and from the selected language the computing environment may also adjust other aspects based on the selected language such as adjusting user interfaces based on the text direction of the selected language and presenting data types in a data format associated with the selected language e.g. presenting dates in a mm dd yyyy or dd mm yyyy format . Additionally the user may adjust other aspects of the computing environment such as the set of input devices available to the user the presentation of particular types of user interfaces such as an on screen keyboard and accessibility features such as high contrast color schemes and large font sizes for users with poor vision and audible user interfaces for users with no vision. Information about users selections to adjust the computing environment may be stored in a user account such as a local or roaming user profile. Additionally the user profile of a user may be secured e.g. through encryption or data access policies and may be accessible to the device only after the user completes the login process e.g. the user profile may be encrypted based in part on the password of the user which may not be directly stored by the device and may be usable only when provided by the user .

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Difficulties may arise in the intersection of the login process of the computing environment and the user s selected adjustments of the computing environment to support features such as selected languages. In particular it may be desirable to present the login process in the user s selected language and optionally with other adjustments such as the user s selected accessibility features and or user interfaces. Indeed in some scenarios a completion of the login process may depend upon such adjustments e.g. a user may not be able to understand the login process if presented in an unfamiliar language or without applying the user s accessibility selections and or may have a username or password including characters in a language that is not supported by the login interface. Moreover if the user s profile is secured prior to completing the login process the device may be unable to access the user s selections during the login process e.g. even after identifying the user the device may be unable to adjust the login process to utilize the user s language selections if this information is stored only in the secured user profile.

Presented herein are techniques for configuring devices to adapt the login process in view of the selections of a user attempting to complete the login process. In accordance with these techniques the device may store a set of login interfaces that vary in different respects e.g. presenting different text languages including user interfaces adapted to different languages and or featuring particular input devices or user interfaces . The device may also be configured to store a set of associations of user accounts and login interfaces such that upon identifying a user as a preliminary or intermediate stage of the login process the device may identify the login interfaces associated with the user account of the user and may present the selected login interfaces during the remainder of the login process. Additionally the associations of user accounts and selected login interfaces may be stored outside of the secured user accounts either alternatively or redundantly with language selections stored within the user accounts and may therefore utilize this information before the completion of the login process that confers access to the secured user account. In this manner the configuration of the device may adapt the login process based on the user s selections of the user representing the selected languages user interfaces accessibility features data types and other user interface variants in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a device featuring a computing environment that is protected by a login process whereby users may present credentials that identify and authenticate the user. These credentials may involve e.g. a username a password or passcode a question involving an answer known only to the user a distinctive activity such as recognizing an image biometric identifiers such as face voice retina or thumbprint recognition or certificates tickets or tokens generated by other authenticating services to identify the user. These login credentials may be compared with or tested against information stored by the device in a user profile of the user in order to verify the login credentials before admitting the user to the computing environment.

Additionally the computing environment to which the user is admitted may be customized on behalf of the user in various ways. For example the user may specify one or more languages in which the user is fluent and the computing environment may adjust the input and output interfaces to communicate with the user in the selected languages. This language adaptation may involve extensive adjustments including adjusting the behavior of input interfaces based on the text direction of the written language e.g. configuring textboxes to receive text in a right to left order for languages with a right to left text direction and data formats e.g. presenting date values in a mm dd yyyy or dd mm yyyy format based on the selected language . The user interface may also be adjusted in other ways e.g. using a set of accessibility features such as high contrast color schemes and large font sizes suitable for users with poor vision and audio only interfaces for blind users and or a set of aesthetic selections such as a color scheme or font that the user selects for the login process . These settings are often stored in a user account such as a user profile that may be stored locally or remotely. Additionally user accounts are often secured e.g. through encryption or data access security policies such that only the user associated with the user account may access these details. In many such configurations the user account may be encrypted and inaccessible until the user provides login credentials which the login process may use to decrypt and access the user profile. For additional security the device may not even store the user s login credentials but may simply use information derived from them for the decryption process. In this manner the information in the user account including the user s selected languages and other settings may be protected from unauthorized access by other users.

However the exemplary scenario of may illustrate some limitations and conflicts arising within this architecture. In particular the security mechanisms of the user account may prevent the device from accessing the user account of the user until the user completes the login process . However the use may be unable to complete the login process unless the user login interface is adjusted to reflect the settings specified in the user account . As a first example the login process may not be able to access the language setting within the user account and may be unable to determine the selected language of the user . The login process may therefore present a login interface using a language that the user does not understand thus interfering with the user s completion of the login process . As a second example the login credentials of the user may include characters that are particular to the selected language of the user but the user interface presented by the login process may not permit such characters. For example the login interface or input components of the device may include a keyboard featuring an ANSI mechanical layout but the user s credentials may include Greek characters that are not available in this mechanical layout. As another example the user account may specify a set of accessibility settings such as a large font size that may not be applied to the login interface and the user may have difficulty completing the login process without the application of these accessibility settings. These and other complications may arise from the inability of the login process to adapt the login interface based on the user account of the user due to the inaccessibility of the user account during the login process .

Presented herein are techniques for alleviating the conflict between the secured storage of a user account of a user and the adaptation of the login process to reflect a selected language and other settings requested by the user . In accordance with these techniques while the user account may remain inaccessible until the completion of the login process the device may be configured to also store language settings selections of accessibility features and other such details outside of the user account in a manner that is associated with the user account of the user . While the user account of the user may contain sensitive information e.g. the user s passwords financial information and private communications to be secured by the security protocol such security considerations may be less significant for the language settings and similar information for the login process and it may be acceptable to store such information outside of the secured user profile .

When the user initiates the login process a default login interface may be presented. When the user selects a user account e.g. inputting a username the login process may examine the language settings and other information that is associated with but stored outside of the user account of the user and may adjust the login interface e.g. to communicate with the user in the user s selected language thereby facilitating the user in completing the login process while maintaining the security of the user account .

Another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner that when executed on a processor of a device cause the device to perform the techniques presented herein. For example the processor executable instructions may be configured to cause the device to perform a method of applying a language selected by a user such as the exemplary method of . Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be implemented.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be applied with many types of devices such as workstations servers consoles and mobile devices such as notebook computers palmtop computers mobile phones portable media players and portable gaming devices.

As a second variation of this first aspect the login process may be presented at many login stages of the device and or operating system . For example the login process may be presented during an initial user registration of the user with the computing environment an initiation of a user session of the user within the computing environment e.g. a new login of a currently logged out user a resumption of a suspended user session of the user within the computing environment e.g. a lock screen presented during a temporary absence of the user and a transfer of a current user session of the user to a different device e.g. a remote login from another device through a protocol such as terminal services .

As a third variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be implemented using various architectures. As a first example the login process may be provided by the device or by the operating system or may comprise a standalone application or library that is separately installed on the device . As a second example the login process may be implemented as a hardware component e.g. a circuit embedded in or inserted into the device a software component that is installed within the computing environment of the operating system or a combination thereof.

As a fourth variation of this first aspect the login process may involve many techniques for user identification and or authentication including a username or distinctive user identifier a password or passphrase a security token provided by an authentication device e.g. in a multi factor authentication protocol questions about knowledge known only to the user biometric identifiers such as face voice retina or thumbprint recognition or certificates tickets or tokens generated by other authenticating services. Additionally the login process may present many types of login interfaces through which the user may interact to complete the login process e.g. textboxes on screen keyboards and or numeric keypads and face and voice recognition techniques as well as several types of hardware input devices e.g. a keyboard or keypad a pointing device such as a mouse or touch sensitive display a camera a microphone and a thumbprint or retina scanner .

As a fifth variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be applied to enable users to select among a variety of languages . While the examples presented herein utilize naturally arising human languages such as English French and German the techniques may also be adapted to enable the selection of a range of natural and artificial languages usable in a range of contexts such as print verbal and gestural communication with other users and or devices. For example the concepts presented herein may be applied for the selection of artificially designed languages such as Esperanto fictional languages such as pirate and Klingon gestural languages such as American Sign Language and semaphore tactile languages such as Braille language encodings such as Morse and functional languages such as C and Java. The techniques presented herein may enable many such types of selections and may involve configuring the operating system to adapt the login process in various ways to reflect such selections.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques involves the manner in which the login process stores and accesses the associations of login interfaces with various user accounts .

As a first variation of this second aspect the associations may identify many types of user accounts including a local user profile that is stored locally on the device a roaming user profile that is accessible to the device over a network and a user directory entry of the user in a user directory e.g. an LDAP server or a contacts database . The association may also identify a user account associated with a different service such as a social network profile of the user in a social network that identifies the user s languages .

As a second variation of this second aspect the device may store the associations in various ways particularly with respect to user accounts that are securely stored by the device . As a first such example for devices that store user accounts according to a security profile that restricts access until login completion of the login process the associations of user accounts and selected login interfaces may be stored outside of the user accounts either redundantly with information stored within the user accounts or exclusively stored outside of the user accounts . For example the device may comprise a device registry having a user registry portion for respective users that is accessible only after login completion of the login process by the user and a login registry portion outside of the user registry portion that is accessible to the device and where the associations are stored. While storing the information in a device registry may present some advantages it may also create some difficulties e.g. in a multi user computing environment where a first user is currently logged in it may be desirable to disable the presentation of the selected login interfaces associated with respective user accounts in order to reduce conflicts over access to the device registry.

As a third variation of this second aspect the associations may be generated and or updated in various ways. As a first such example when the user selects a login interface during or after the login process the device may update the associations to reflect the selected login interface . As a second such example when the user adjusts the computing environment after completing the login process e.g. selecting a language or an accessibility feature to be used by the device while communicating with the user the device may update the language settings and other information within the user account and may also update the associations stored outside the user account between the user account and the selected login interfaces in order to reflect the new selections during the next login process of the user . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such ways of storing and accessing the associations in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the stages and details of the login process .

As a first variation of this third aspect the device may be configured before receiving a selection of a user account to communicate with users through a default login interface such as a default language .

As a second variation of this third aspect the device may enable a user to select a login interface during the login process and may adjust the login process to utilize the selected login interface .

As a first example of this second variation the device may be configured to present to the user a set of available login interfaces upon detecting a new user of the device e.g. either the first user to access the device upon activation or a different user of a device that is already in use by others .

As a second such example the device may be configured to infer a selection of a language and a corresponding login interface based on various factors. For example the device may be configured to receive a type of user input from the user e.g. the user s name an entry of text or a speech segment to infer a selected language of the user based on the user input e.g. inferring a user s nationality and native language based on his or her name or applying a natural language parser to any input provided by the user to identify the language of the user input and to select a login interface corresponding to the identified language .

As a third example of this second variation the login process may enumerate for the user a set of available login interfaces such as a list of languages that are installed on the device and applicable to the login process . Upon receiving a login selection of a login interface from the user during the login process e.g. a selection of a language from the language list the device may present the login interface associated with the login selection. In addition to the login interfaces associated with a user account of a user the enumeration may include the default login interface . This may be advantageous e.g. if the device is incapable of presenting the login interfaces associated with the user account e.g. the user may select a Japanese language login interface but the device may include neither an input device with a Japanese mechanical layout nor a Japanese language on screen keyboard and the user may only be able to complete the login process using the default login interface for the device . Alternatively or additionally a user profile of a user may directly or indirectly exclude one or more login interfaces e.g. that are not to be presented to or used by the user during the login process e.g. an input device that a physically disabled user is unable to manipulate or an authentication technique that is deemed to be inaccurate or inadequately secure and the device may exclude these options from the enumeration of login interfaces presented to the user .

As a third variation of this third aspect the login process may be configured to enable a user to select a user account in various ways. For example the device may initiate the login process by enumerating for the user the user accounts available in the computing environment e.g. the names of users permitted to login to the device and upon the user selecting a user account may present a login interface associated with the selected user account for the remainder of the login process . Alternatively the device may initiate the login process by presenting a login account identifier interface e.g. a textbox where a user may enter a username or other user account identifier or instructions for the user to present a biometric identifier or security badge .

As a fourth variation of this third aspect the login process may enable a user to present a request for a particular a login interface and if the requested login interface is not currently available the device may endeavor to retrieve or generate the requested login interface for the user . For example the device may have access to a login interface store that is capable of providing resources for various login interfaces e.g. translations in various languages of the information provided in the login process . Upon receiving a user request for a login interface that is not available on the device the device may request the specified login interface from the login interface store and upon receiving the login interface may present the login interface to the user . In some scenarios the login interfaces may be distinctively identified by a login interface identifier e.g. the ANSI defined language code of the languages for installed or retrievable user interfaces . The login process may be configured to indicate the available and or retrievable login interfaces for the user using these distinctive login interface identifiers and may receive the user request specifying a login interface according to its distinctive login interface identifier. In this manner the device may facilitate the login process for a user even if the requested login interface is not currently available.

As a fifth variation of this third aspect the login process may adapt and present a login interface with variants in many login interface variants based on the user s selected settings in addition to a login interface language variant i.e. the language used by the device to communicate with the user during the login process . As a first example the user s settings may also specify a login interface accessibility variant e.g. an accessibility adjustment of the computing environment of the device such as a high contrast color scheme and or large font size for users with poor vision or a audio only interface for users with no vision . As a second example the user s settings may include a login interface input device variant that specifies an input device through which the user is permitted to achieve the login completion e.g. the identification of trusted input components that have been inspected for security or the types of input devices that are trusted by the security process for example a tightly secured device may only permit users to authenticate through highly trusted authentication mechanisms such as retina scans rather than less trusted authentication mechanisms such as thumbprint scans . As a third example the user s settings may specify aesthetic selections e.g. a color scheme and font that the user selects for the login process and the login process may adapt the login interface according to these selections. Many such login interface variants may be designed and applied by the login process in accordance with the techniques presented herein.
