title: Processing combining-character sequences
abstract: Particular embodiments of a computing device receive an indication of a character encoding system and a combining-character sequence. The character encoding system may comprise one or more ranges of character elements. The combining-character sequence may comprise two or more character elements. The two or more character elements may comprise at least one base letter and one or more combining marks. A mapping code may be determined for the combining-character sequence. If no mapping code exists, a next-available mapping code may be determined, and the combining-character sequence may be stored in association with the next-available mapping code in a data store on the computing device. A corresponding glyph may be determined based on the mapping codeâ€”if no glyph exists, the glyph may be generated or retrieved from a server and stored in association with the mapping code in the data store. Information may be provided to display the glyph.

This disclosure generally relates to displaying text on client devices in particular processing combining character sequences for display on client devices.

Web browsers and other software applications may rely upon character encoding standards in order to ensure that most if not all characters including combining character sequence based characters such as hacek over and tilde over are predictably rendered across different client devices which may have different versions of the browser or other software application running on top of different operating systems which are themselves executing on different hardware configurations. One such character encoding standard is Unicode. The Unicode Standard A Technical Introduction provides a concise introduction to Unicode as shown in the following excerpt see http www.unicode.org standard principles.html 

The Unicode Standard is the universal character encoding standard used for representation of text for computer processing. The Unicode Standard defines codes for characters used in all the major languages written today. Scripts include the European alphabetic scripts Middle Eastern right to left scripts and many scripts of Asia. The Unicode Standard further includes punctuation marks diacritics mathematical symbols technical symbols arrows dingbats emoji etc. It provides codes for diacritics which are modifying character marks such as the tilde that are used in conjunction with base characters to represent accented letters n for example . In all the Unicode Standard Version 6.0 provides codes for 109 449 characters from the world s alphabets ideograph sets and symbol collections.

The majority of common use characters fit into the first 64K code points an area of the codespace that is called the basic multilingual plane BMP . There are sixteen other supplementary planes available for encoding other characters with currently over 860 000 unused code points. More characters are under consideration for addition to future versions of the standard. The Unicode Standard also reserves code points for private use. Vendors or end users can assign these internally for their own characters and symbols or use them with specialized fonts. There are 6 400 private use code points on the BMP and another 131 068 supplementary private use code points should 6 400 be insufficient for particular applications.

Text elements are encoded as sequences of one or more characters. Certain of these sequences are called combining character sequences made up of a base letter and one or more combining marks which are rendered around the base letter above it below it etc. . For example a sequence of a followed by a combining circumflex would be rendered as . Certain sequences of characters can also be represented as a single character called a precomposed character or composite or decomposible character . For example the character can be encoded as the single code point U 00FC or as the base character U 0075 u followed by the non spacing character U 0308 umlaut over . The Unicode Standard encodes precomposed characters for compatibility with established standards such as Latin 1 which includes many precomposed characters such as and .

A single number is assigned to each code element defined by the Unicode Standard. Each of these numbers is called a code point and when referred to in text is listed in hexadecimal form following the prefix U . For example the code point U 0041 is the hexadecimal number 0041 equal to the decimal number 65 . It represents the character A in the Unicode Standard. As discussed above a range of code points on the BMP and two very large ranges in the supplementary planes are reserved as private use areas. These code points have no universal meaning and may be used for characters specific to a program or by a group of users for their own purposes. For example a group of choreographers may design a set of characters for dance notation and encode the characters using code points in user space. A set of page layout programs may use the same code points as control codes to position text on the page. The main point of user space is that the Unicode Standard assigns no meaning to these code points and reserves them as user space promising never to assign them meaning in the future. end of excerpt 

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users. The social networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system.

Particular embodiments of a client device maintain a data store of mapping codes e.g. Unicode code points in the range s reserved for private use that correspond to particular combining character sequences used by a particular user associated with the client device. In particular embodiments when there is a need for a glyph corresponding to a new combining character sequence that does not already exist as a pre composed glyph and that does not already exist in the mapping table a new listing may be created in the mapping table that correlates a new mapping code to the new combining character sequence. The client side software may also request from a server side data store a rendered version of the glyph corresponding to the combining character sequence and stores the glyph on the client device. In particular embodiments the mapping table may be stored in session space in a cache and may be refreshed cleared on a per user session basis. In particular embodiments the client side software may maintain certain frequently used mapping codes in a persistent data store on the client device.

Particular embodiments of a client device generate mapping codes e.g. Unicode code points in the range s reserved for private use that correspond to particular combining character sequences used by a particular user associated with the client device. When there is a need for a glyph corresponding to a new combining character sequence that does not already exist as a pre composed glyph and that does not already exist in the mapping table a new listing may be created in the mapping table that correlates the next available mapping code to the new combining character sequence. A new mapping code may be used for each graphical variant of a glyph e.g. different font sizes different font typefaces bold underline italic etc. . The client side software may also request from a server a rendered version of the glyph corresponding to the combining character sequence and stores the glyph on the client device. Client devices are described in further detail with respect to and corresponding text in the specification.

In particular embodiments new mapping codes are associated with combining character sequences on an as needed basis for the user of the client device. The mapping table may be stored in session space in a cache and may be refreshed cleared on a per user session basis. The client side software may maintain certain frequently used mapping codes in a persistent data store on the client device. The determination of which combining character sequences are to be mapped in the first instance and or preserved in the persistent data store may be based on the user s usage history.

In particular embodiments where the user is part of a social networking system new mapping codes may also or alternatively be associated with combining character sequences according to social networking factors tracked server side in relation to usage statistics for 1 combining character sequences that are predicted to be popular with users of a social networking system that have profile characteristics similar to the user s profile age gender location groups school interests 2 combining character sequences that are predicted to be popular with users of a social networking system that are connected to the user in a social graph 3 combining character sequences that appear in social networking content generated by social connections of the user or 4 combining character sequences that appear in third party content associated with the user or social connections of the user. In such embodiments a server may periodically push out new glyphs to client devices to be added to their mapping tables. In such embodiments the server may also maintain a multi dimensional table to track the social factors in relation to usage statistics for combining character sequences. Social graphs and related social networking content are described in further detail with respect to and corresponding text in the specification. Social networking systems are described in further detail with respect to and corresponding text in the specification.

Within the context of this disclosure a character element may be a base character element or a combining character element. A base character element may form a character on its own. A combining character element does not form a character on its own in typical use and usually appears in conjunction with a base character element. A character may be comprised of two or more character elements i.e. at least one base character element and one or more combining character elements . A character may refer to a pre composed character or a decomposed combining character sequence. A glyph may refer to the final rendered form of a character including all character elements in a combining character sequence. A glyph is typically provided in an image file format such as a bitmap. See Table 1 for a few examples of characters and their decompositions into character elements 

The overall set of possible combining character sequences in any given language may be extremely large however the typical number of combining character sequences typed by any given user is very low on the order of tens and rarely exceeds 500 on a per user session basis. Particular embodiments generate mapping codes e.g. Unicode code points in the range s reserved for private use that correspond to particular combining character sequences used by a particular user associated with the client device. The steps involved in producing the examples shown in are described in further detail in and related text in the specification.

In either case the client device may receive one or more combining character sequences for which it needs to render the appropriate characters for display. Each combining character sequence may comprise two or more character elements. Of the two or more character elements there are at least one base character element and one or more combining character character elements as illustrated by the examples shown in .

In step for each received combining character sequence particular embodiments determine whether a mapping code based on the character encoding system exists for the combining character sequence. Table 2 below illustrates an example table storing combining character sequences associated with mapping codes and corresponding glyphs.

In particular embodiments a separate set of mapping codes may exist for each character encoding system utilized on the client device. Mapping codes may be stored in a table in cache memory as part of a user session in a database in persistent storage or in any other form of data store on the user s device. Types of data stores for a client device are described in further detail with respect to and corresponding text in the specification. In particular embodiments where the mapping codes are stored in a database table the database table may be indexed according to the combining character sequences.

If a mapping code already exists for the combining character sequence in step particular embodiments retrieve the mapping code for the combining character sequence from the data store on the client device. In step particular embodiments retrieve the glyph for the combining character sequence based on the mapping code. The glyph may also be stored on the client device.

If a new mapping code needs to be created for the combining character sequence in step particular embodiments determine a new mapping code for the combining character sequence and store the new mapping code in association with the combining character sequence. In step particular embodiments request a new glyph for the combining character sequence and store the new glyph on the client device in association with the mapping code. In particular embodiments the request may be made to a server that renders the new glyph and sends it back to the client device. For example the client device may send a HTTP request to a server wherein the request comprises the combining character sequence at which point the server composes the corresponding character and generates a rasterized bitmap of the glyph which is then sent back to the client device. In particular embodiments software may exist on the client device itself that can compose the character corresponding to the combining character sequence and generate the glyph. The glyph may be stored in the same data store and or data structure as the mapping code or it may be stored in a related data store and or data structure.

In particular embodiments the character encoding system may reserve a range of codes for private use e.g. the Unicode private use code points in which case the next available code in this private use range may be utilized for the new mapping code.

In particular embodiments a new mapping code may be used for each graphical variant of a glyph e.g. different font sizes different font typefaces bold underline italic etc. . For example acute over may be stored using a different mapping code than acute over .

In step particular embodiments provide information to display the glyph on the client device. For example a bitmap of the glyph may be rendered for display in a manner appropriate to the display capabilities of the client device.

In particular embodiments where mapping codes for combining character sequences are stored in a data store on the client device there may be a need to continually or periodically remove old listings or entirely clear out or refresh the mapping codes. In one example in embodiments where mapping codes are stored on a per user per session basis all mapping codes may be flushed at the end of each user session. In another example only the most frequently used mapping codes may be retained in more persistent storage and all others cleared from a cache. In another example mapping codes may be assigned an expiration date. Any conventional algorithm for determining how to manage the storage of mapping codes may be utilized. If storage space is not an issue there may be no need to remove old mapping codes and their corresponding glyphs.

In step particular embodiments may determine which stored mapping codes to clear from the client device e.g. if there is a need to reclaim storage space for other purposes . For example any mapping code that has not been used in the last month may be deemed no longer useful to retain. In step particular embodiments clear one or more perhaps all of the mapping codes and possibly the corresponding glyphs from the client device.

In particular embodiments if the user is part of the social networking system the creation and or maintenance of mapping codes and corresponding glyphs may be based on social networking factors assessed by the social networking system in relation to usage statistics. When the social networking system determines that particular users may require new mapping codes to be generated in association with certain new combining character sequences the social networking system may send notifications to the client devices associated with those particular users so that mapping codes can be pre emptively created for those new combining character sequences. In addition if required a server may generate and push out the corresponding glyphs to those client devices that cannot generate the glyphs on their own. In such embodiments where mapping codes and glyphs are pre emptively created and or stored management of the client side data store for such mapping codes and glyphs may become more important.

New mapping codes may be generated in association with combining character sequences that are or are predicted to be popular with users of the social networking system that have profile characteristics similar to the user s profile age gender location groups school interests . For example 13 17 year old students who attend public high schools in a particular county may adopt new slang that requires one or more particular combining character sequences. In another example 25 40 year old professionals working in a particular industry may coin a neologism that requires one or more particular combining character sequences. In this case glyphs corresponding to those new combining character sequences may also be pushed out to users who fit the profile of users using those new combining character sequences in anticipation that they may also begin using the combining character sequence soon. New mapping codes may also be generated in association with combining character sequences often used by users of the social networking system that are connected to the user in association with a social graph. For example if a critical mass of the user s first degree connections have all recently begun using a particular combining character sequence the glyph corresponding to that combining character sequence may also be pushed out to the user.

New mapping codes may also be generated in association with combining character sequences that appear in social networking content or other information generated by social connections of the user. For example if many users having similar interest as the user or belonging to the same group as the user have begun tagging particular types of photos with a new combining character sequence or posting status updates with the new combining character sequence the social networking system may anticipate that the user may also adopt the new combining character sequence. New mapping codes may also be generated in association with combining character sequences that appear in third party content or other information associated with the user or social connections of the user. For example if a particular music video published by an entertainment company goes viral e.g. PSY s Gangnam Style or the social networking system may then determine that social networking users who upload like or comment on the video may be inclined to start using new combining character sequences detected in the video.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may also maintain a multi dimensional table to track the various social networking factors in relation to usage statistics for new combining character sequences. In particular embodiments client devices may transmit usage statistics and or a usage history back to the social networking system.

The client device may receive combining character sequences from different sources such as input typed by a user into client computing device content retrieved from a third party server content retrieved from social networking system or notifications regarding new combining character sequences pushed out by social networking system .

The client device may then attempt to look up mapping codes and glyphs for the new combining character sequences . If client device determines that mapping codes does not currently exist for the new combining character sequences then client device may create the mapping codes and send a request for corresponding glyphs based on the combining character sequences to a third party server . Note for the purposes of this diagram the third party server has been depicted as both providing new combining character sequences and also as providing new glyphs however in practice these two functions may be performed by separate and completely unrelated systems. Once the client device receives the glyphs it can then provide the glyphs for display and store them on client device .

In particular embodiments where notifications regarding new combining character sequences have been pushed out by social networking system client device may send back usage statistics regarding the user s use of combining character sequences to social networking system in order to facilitate data collection to support the social networking factors.

Although the embodiments disclosed herein describe the mapping codes as being stored on the client device in particular embodiments a set of mapping codes may be maintained on a server in association with a profile for the user of the client device. In particular embodiments sets of mapping codes may be determined by a server or on client devices for users in particular locations e.g. according to the state country borders particular self identified groups of users users with particular demographic profiles users associated with particular organizations etc.

In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to a user of social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments when a user registers for an account with social networking system social networking system may create a user node corresponding to the user and store the user node in one or more data stores. Users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to registered users and user nodes associated with registered users. In addition or as an alternative users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to users that have not registered with social networking system . In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may provide his or her name profile picture contact information birth date sex marital status family status employment education background preferences interests or other demographic information. In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more webpages or one or more user profile pages which may be webpages .

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social network system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a webpage.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may transmit a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes paritcular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

This disclosure contemplates any suitable network .
