Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to particle imaging and more particularly to methods and apparatuses for contact free holographic imaging of aerosol particles.

The in situ characterization of small aerosol particles is a persistent objective in many applied contexts. Examples include the determination of atmospheric aerosol composition for climate modeling and the detection of biological or chemical weapons agents for defense applications. Various measurements and calculations of single and multiple particle scattering patterns are known. The overall goal of such work is to infer information relating to the particles physical form such as size and shape by analyzing the angular structure of these patterns. Unfortunately a fundamental limitation of this approach is the absence of an unambiguous quantitative relationship between a pattern and the corresponding particle properties i.e. the so called inverse problem. Consequently the inference of these properties from the patterns has proved to be very difficult in practice except for the simplest of cases. Ideally one would prefer to image the particles directly thus eliminating the complexity and ambiguity associated with interpretation of the scattering patterns.

However the typical particle size range of interest for many applications is roughly 0.1 10 m. Because of the small size direct images are possible in only part of this range and only with high numerical aperture NA optics and small focal volumes. Such imaging typically requires the collection and immobilization of particle samples and thus is not a practical technique for particle characterization in applications requiring high sample through put or images of the particles in their undisturbed form i.e. in situ images.

Holography is an alternative technique that combines useful elements of both conventional imaging and scattering. Fundamentally this is a two step process first an object is illuminated with coherent light and then the intensity pattern resulting from the interference of this light with that scattered by the particle is recorded. The resulting pattern constitutes the hologram from which an image of the object is reconstructed. Traditionally holograms are recorded with photographic film due to the film s high resolution. Such a high resolution medium is required to capture the finer features of the interference pattern. The subsequent chemical development of the film is costly and time consuming which greatly limits the practical utility of the technique.

Methods and apparatuses for holographic contact free imaging of aerosol particles in an efficient manner are described herein according to embodiments of the present invention.

According to one embodiment an apparatus for holographic imaging of an aerosol particle may include a delivery device configured to deliver the particle into a region a light source for outputting a first beam of light and a second beam of light wherein the first beam travels into the region producing a first light wave which is un scattered by the particle and a second light wave that is scattered by the particle and the second beam does not travel into the region a beam splitter for combining the second beam with the scattered light of the first beam into combined interference light an image sensor for sensing an interference pattern created by the combined interference light and an image processor configured to generate an image of the aerosol particle based on the sensed interference pattern.

According to another embodiment a method for holographic imaging of an aerosol particle may include delivering the particle into a region outputting a first beam of light and a second beam of light wherein the first beam travels into the region producing a first light wave which is un scattered by the particle and a second light wave that is scattered by the particle and the second beam does not travel into the region separating the scattered light from the un scattered light of the first beam combining the second beam with the scattered light of the first beam into combined interference light sensing the interference pattern of the combined interference light and generating an image of the aerosol particle based on the sensed interference pattern.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise forming a holographic image of particles using a light source to generate a wave which scatters when interacting with the aerosol particle and an un scattered reference wave and recording the interference pattern between the scattering wave and the reference wave on an image sensor and using a computer aided algorithm to generate an image from the interference pattern.

Aerosol particles of interest may include for example environmental hazards e.g. asbestos smog smoke etc. chemicals toxins biological contaminants or spores e.g. or anthrax chemical or biological warfare agents hydrosols i.e. particles in water other airborne contaminants e.g. dust pollen or other pollutants and the like. Particles may be already present in the air or originate in water dirt or other substances which may then become airborne.

The particle characterization techniques disclosed herein extend capabilities of elastic light scattering by using holography to form images of one or more particles rather than their scattering patterns in embodiments. A particle s far field scattering pattern interferes across the surface of an image sensor along with a reference wave having a portion of the light incident on the particle. For example the scattered and reference wave may overlap in an in line configuration embodiment and be separated for instance in an off axis configuration in other embodiments.

The resulting intensity distribution recorded by the image sensor is the particle s hologram. A three dimensional image of the particle can then be generated computationally from the hologram. Further computational analysis of the resulting image can be performed to satisfy the requirements of the intended application such as for example detection of particle size shape and or other characteristics thereof. One advantage of these techniques is that there may be no further need to interpret or invert a complicated scattering pattern as information can be retrieved directly from the image. Holography permits the reconstruction of phase magnitude or both of the scattered wave pattern for instance.

Using digital media rather than traditional photographic film holograms can be recorded rapidly in succession as the particles flow through the apparatus. This makes for a high through put detection technique. Reconstructing images of a particle from its hologram digitally enables application of any number of image analysis techniques intended to characterize the particle. For example the digitally reconstructed particle images can be automatically correlated with a library of simulated or measured images. This may enable a rapid detection identification system.

The optical device in may be implemented with the laser and the optics . The laser outputs a light wave into a polarizer . The polarizer polarizes the light . In an embodiment the polarizer is a Glan Thompson polarizer though the present invention does not restrict the type of polarizer used. The light from the polarizer is directed towards a convex lens for focusing onto a pinhole which in an embodiment the convex lens has a focal length of 75 mm and the pinhole has a 50 m diameter. The primary lobe of the pinhole diffraction pattern produced by pinhole illuminates a second pinhole with a diameter of 25 m. These pinholes clean the beam improving its spatial coherence and enhancing the quality of the hologram. All but the primary lobe of this second pinhole pattern is blocked by iris where convex lens then collimates the beam which is brought to a focus by convex lens at a point approximately 2 mm from the aerosol nozzle outlet . In an embodiment the convex lens may have a focal length of 300 mm and the convex lens has a focal length of 30 mm.

The aerosol nozzle outlet and the aerosol nozzle inlet may form the delivery device in . In this embodiment a nozzle and suction tube are used to direct aerosol particles into the scattering volume area region however the present invention does not limit the delivery mechanism. shows in more detail one embodiment of the region. In other embodiments the delivery device includes a free flowing channel of aerosol or particles entrained in a microfluidic channel or flow.

The optical trigger device in may be implemented using the photomultiplier tubes and along with the diode laser beams and . In an embodiment the PMTs are a Hamamatsu Corp. Model No. H6780 02 and the diode laser beam is a 635 nm wavelength laser beam. The beam from the laser is focused using the convex lens into the region where the particles are delivered by delivery device .

The focused laser beam scatters from particles in the region. The scattered waves are focused using a convex lens and pass through an iris a 635 nm line filter and then passes to photomultiplier tube if the wavelength of the focused light is 635 nm. The diode laser generates a 670 nm beam which is focused using convex lens into the region where particles are delivered. The focused laser beam scatters from particles in the region. The scattered waves are focused using a convex lens and pass through an iris a 670 nm line filter and then to photomultiplier tube if the wavelength of the focused light is 670 nm. The laser may be pulsed only when both photomultipliers and detect light for their particular wavelength at which point it is established that there is particle in the region. The controller uses a processor to execute a FFT module to generate the particle s image from the hologram sensed by sensor . For instance the sensor may be spaced apart from the particle stream by a distance of approximately 8 cm in some cases. In an embodiment the controller identifies the particle by matching its holographic image with images stored in database stored in memory of the controller . The database may store a digital library of simulated or measured images. The resolution of the image produced by the controller for this embodiment of the inline system is on the order of 5 m but may readily be improved to less than 5 m by using a shorter wavelength laser and a sensor with smaller pixel dimensions.

In some embodiments one or more of the NPBS the pin hole and the convex lens illustrated in may be omitted from implementation . This is because the polarizer and or dual pin holes may only be needed in some instances if the light source laser has poor beam quality. In addition other optical elements may be removed where they are considered redundant or superfluous.

Further using a pulsed light source may also permit investigation of particle systems in motion. Other elements in various embodiments may be the same or similar as those in implementation shown in .

The light scattering pattern from an aerosol particle is generally a function of its size shape composition and or surface structure. The light scattering pattern signal may be used to characterize the particle. In particular the angular structure of a particle s scattering pattern may be related to the particle s overall shape through a Fourier transform relationship. For example information relating to the largest length of the particle is contained in the small angle region of the scattering pattern. Likewise small length scale features of the particle such as surface roughness are generally contained in larger angle regions of the pattern. Consequently holographic imaging of the particle s overall shape dictates that the hologram is formed from a portion of the particle s scattering pattern that includes the small forward scattering angles. However because of the small size of the particles it may be difficult to separate this small forward angle region of the pattern from the much more intense unscattered illumination beam. This problem may be overcome or ameliorated using a spatial filtering technique in which the unscattered light is removed from the pattern.

A digital hologram or interference image may include gray scale image data which corresponds to the intensity distribution of interference of the incident and scattered waves across the image sensor. A nested ring appearance which may be visible at some portions of the holographic image for a point like particle is due to the intersection of the spherical wave structure of the scattered wave with the planar incident wave.

To obtain images of a particle from the digital hologram one or more pixels of the hologram may be regarded as a point electric dipole with polarization proportional to the gray value of the pixel. If a pixel in the hologram is black indicating no light on that portion of the image sensor then the polarization may be assumed to be zero. Conversely for a white pixel value the Maxwell volume integral equation may be used to calculate the electric field resulting from the radiation of the collection of dipoles corresponding to the hologram pixel. The magnitude and or phase of this radiation or reconstruction field is then calculated in a plane parallel to the hologram but separated from it by a distance equal to the separation between the particle and the image sensor. This results in a two dimensional computer generated image of the particle in this place as given by the distribution of reconstruction field magnitude. The phase the magnitude or both of this field can be used to generate a three dimensional rending of the particle.

One embodiment for generating an image of the sample aerosol particle according to the sensed interference pattern will now be described. Let the source of the reference wave laser be located at a distance I from the particle and the sensor at a distance d. Provided that kl and kd are large enough to satisfy far field conditions described in M. Mishchenko L. Travis and A. Lacis Multiple scattering of light by particles radiative transfer and coherent backscattering Cambridge Cambridge University Press 2006 pp. 74 78 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The reference and scattered waves will be transverse and spherical at the sensor and can be represented entirely by their scattering amplitudes as described by M. Berg and G. Videen Digital holographic imaging of aerosol particles in flight Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy Radiative Transfer 112 2011 pp. 1776 1783 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety as follows 

Often the intensity of the reference wave at the sensor is much greater than that of the scattered wave. This is especially true in this work where the objects being illuminated are small particles as opposed to the macroscopic sized objects involved in many other applications. This means that the term

One advantage of using the Fresnel Kirchhoff approximation to generate the reconstructed particle image is that the approximation s mathematical form is essentially a discrete Fourier transform of the sensor pixel values constituting I. This enables the use of the fast Fourier transform FFT in the calculation thus substantially reducing the computation time required to render the particle image. In practice d may not be known to sufficient accuracy to be able to reconstruct an image from a single application of the reconstruction routine. This inaccuracy is due to the variation in particle positions in the aerosol stream as they enter the region . Consequently the image reconstruction stage includes a focusing like procedure First an initial image is reconstructed using an estimate of d based on the experimental layout. Then the reconstruction plane is scanned along the z axis in small steps until the reconstructed image comes into focus.

In other embodiments the reconstruction of the holographic image may use a computational procedure using a Kirchoff Helmholtz formula such as Equations 2 and 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 6 411 406 entitled Holographic Microscope and Method of Hologram Reconstruction herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

By using the disclosed holographic techniques multiple particles may be in the scattering region at a time. In addition the holographic techniques do not require particles to be in each other s far field zones. Thus if multiple particles are present when the hologram is recorded they can be independently imaged digitally from the hologram by varying the distance from the hologram to the reconstruction plane. Accordingly it is possible to digitally target or focus in on one particle or another.

Holographic images that can be used to characterize the morphology of particles may be on the order of the wavelength of the illuminating light which may be between 4 and 7 m in size and larger for visible light and resolutions may be obtained approximately 1 10 of this wavelength for example in some implementations.

The detecting device comprises two diode lasers and respectively emitting 635 nm and 670 nm light in an embodiment. The beams emitted from the diode lasers and intersect where a particle will be delivered and scatter the respective wavelength light to be detected by photomultipliers and . The detecting device may further include additional elements not shown similar to those shown in such as convex lens and for focusing the laser beams emitted from the diode lasers onto the particle convex lens for focusing the scattered light from the particle toward the PMTs and filters for selectively filtering a particular wavelength of light that is received by the PMTs . When the PMTs and detect a particle the optical device is enabled and the laser light source pulses laser beam .

The NPBS splits the laser beam into two beams and . Beam interacts with particle causing a first scattering pattern in addition to non scattered light to emerge at lens . The lens serves two purposes. First the lens is placed at a distance of one focal length from the scattering volume where particle is located such that the scattered light is collimated when it leaves lens . Second the un scattered illuminating beam is brought to a focus at the back focal plane of lens . Since it is desired to remove this portion of un scattered light the mirror reflects the scattered light and the un scattered illuminated focused beam passes through through hole of the mirror . In some embodiments the mirror can be configured to separate the scattered and unscattered light down to very small angles i.e. 0.1 degree from the forward direction. The scattered light is then reflected to NPBS . It will be appreciated that other optical elements might also be used to separate the scattered light from the unscattered light. This separation also removes the D.C. or so called zero order region in the hologram which is the high intensity region due to the unscattered light.

The second split wave from NPBS serves as a reference beam and is deflected towards the mirror which may be placed at an angle e.g. a 45 degree angle in an embodiment further deflecting the beam. In some embodiments a neutral density ND filter may be provided to maximize the contrast of the interference fringes by making the field intensity of the reference beam approximately the same as that of the scattered light field. The lens expands the beam and the convex lens collimates the light from lens onto the NPBS . The NPBS then combines the reference beam with the particle scattered wave reflected from mirror into combined interference light. The NPBS may be placed on a rotation stage introducing a small offset angle between the reference wave and the collimated scattered wave not shown . This introduces a small angular separation between the so called twin images that occur during the image reconstruction stage. Convex lenses and image the interference pattern of the reference wave and the collimated wave through the iris onto the sensor . The lens pair and the iris in front of the sensor are used to suppress stray light from dust and the like that collects on the optical surfaces between the region and the sensor . In an embodiment the sensor is a Charged Coupled Device CCD camera but in other embodiments the sensor may be any sensor capable of capturing an image such as an Intensified Charged Coupled Device ICCD camera or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor CMOS camera and the like. In an embodiment a Finger Lakes Instrumentation LLC Model ML8300 CCD having a pixel size of approximately 5.4 m may be used. The sensor outputs the interference pattern to the computer system containing a processor and memory with a FFT and a database . The processor executes the FFT and generates an image of the particles. The resolution of the holographic image produced by the system for a dual beam system is in this embodiment on the order of about 1 micron.

Other elements of implementation may be the same or similar as those of implementations in some embodiments such as for example optical elements systems for focusing or collimating light trigger system electronics and a particle trap.

By using two separate beams it may be further possible to modify the intensity of the reference beam the incident beam or both to increase the contrast of the fringes on the sensor . And with this configuration the particle s forward scattered light can be collected over an angular range of about 0.1 to 20 degrees in the polar angle and 0 to 360 in the azimuthal angle. The interference pattern recorded by the sensor may be a digital off axis hologram. From this hologram an image e.g. a three dimensional image of the particle can be reconstructed computationally. Holograms can be recorded for one or more particles in the aerosol sample as they flow through the scattering volume substantially in real time. The scattered field remains stable with the particle located at different positions within the scattering volume.

Limitations on the apparatus may be the read out or refresh rate of the image sensor the size of the image sensor and or the processing speed of the image processor for digital reconstruction. Features in the interference pattern at the image sensor plane that are finer than the pixel size may be averaged out across that pixel although this may result is some image loss in some instances. The finite size of the image sensor can also limit the resolution with the resolution of the reconstructed image being diffracted limited by the array pixels. Assuming a pixel size of 5.4 micrometers and an image sensor array size of 3000 3000 pixels reconstruction resolution of image features with length scaled less than one micron may not be feasible in some instances.

In addition to pixel size there may also be a restriction on the maximum particle size that may be feasible for imaging. This limitation may originate from the requirement that the collimated scatting wave and the incident reference wave intersect at the image sensor plane at an angle large enough to separate the particle image from the so called zero order term. This term represents a region in the reconstruction plane around the forward direction where the autocorrelation of the particle s image forms than its image alone. For example one typical upper size limit for 532 nm illuminating light may be about 20 micrometers. This may not be a critical limitation for all monitoring situations since particles of interest tend to be smaller than 10 micrometers and larger particles tend to fall out of the atmosphere more rapidly.

Finally image is a depiction of a conventional microscope image of the same cluster of ragweed pollen particles for comparative purposes.

By comparing these images one can see that the holographic apparatus successfully produces an accurate image of the pollen cluster with sufficient resolution to discern individual pollen particles and even a faint signature of the single particle surface roughness seen in the microscope images. This corresponds to a resolution roughly between 8 10 m although a more rigorous resolution analysis is not performed. Referring to the measured and contrast holograms shown in this figure it is apparent how subtraction of the incident beam across the CCD i.e. Iremoves noise due to imperfections in the incident beam profile. This has the consequence of producing a cleaner contrast hologram which subsequently improves the particle image. The holographic and microscope images of the cluster may differ slightly in overall size and detailed structural form. Although it is clearly the same cluster in c and d the differences are likely due to shifting of the cluster on the microscope slide during transfer from the apparatus to the microscope. is a block diagram of an embodiment of a computer system in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention.
