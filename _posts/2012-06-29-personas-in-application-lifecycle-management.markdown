title: Personas in application lifecycle management
abstract: A user management construct, referred to as a persona, is provided to enable a flexible mechanism that grants elevated or administrative privileges to users, such as application developers. Developers may utilize the privileges bestowed by a persona to execute tasks that normally requires access by traditional information (IT) roles, such as IT administrators, to deploy applications in a cloud computing environment. The tasks may include the provisioning of virtual or physical computing resources and/or the configuration of compute, storage, and networking resources.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a method for managing administrative access to a computing platform having a plurality of tiered computing components that support a virtualization environment.

Software is increasingly being developed as web applications to be deployed in a cloud computing environment. Software development cycles have shrunk and products are deployed in cloud computing environments with increasing frequency. As such enterprises engaged in managing application lifecycles e.g. developing testing and deploying applications face challenges in dealing with various layers of the cloud computing environment that include hardware infrastructure e.g. computing networking and storage virtualization environments executing thereon and application services e.g. database customer relationship management services etc. For example software developers have been taking on a role sometimes referred to as dev ops that shares some duties similar to that of a traditional information technology IT role. However traditional enterprise information technology IT roles such as server administrator UNIX administrator network storage or Exchange administrator have not adjusted to this trend and continue to operate in isolation or in silos . As a result use of cloud services in IT administration has caused organizational friction within enterprises particularly between developers and IT. For example it has been difficult for a developer to play the role of an IT administrator when a web application they have developed is deployed in a cloud environment and the developer does not have administrative credentials to provision resources set up virtual machines etc.

Embodiments of the invention provide an enterprise IT organizational structure referred to as a persona which defines administrative privileges for a specific situation during a lifecycle of an application. Users such as developers may be granted membership in or adopt a persona and then invoke operations that are associated with and authorized for the persona. Personas obviate organizational friction that may result from insufficient authorization between different organizational units e.g. developers and IT administrators by introducing amorphous groups of identifies to an existing organizational structure that grants authorization and access control in a transitory role in a controlled manner.

Embodiments of the invention provide a method for managing administrative access to a computing platform having a plurality of tiered computing components. The method includes generating a plurality of personas each of which defines a different set of administrative tasks that a user having the persona is permitted to carry out. The method further includes selecting one of the personas to be associated with a user to allow the user to carry out the set of administrative tasks defined by the persona.

Embodiments of the invention also provide a method for carrying out administrative access to a computing platform having a plurality of tiered computing components. The method generally includes receiving a request from a user to carry out an administrative task and determining if the user is permitted to carry out the administrative task based on whether the user is associated with a persona that defines a set of administrative tasks that can be carried out by users associated therewith wherein the administrative task requested by the user is in the set. The method further includes issuing commands to execute the administrative task responsive to determining the user is permitted to carry out the administrative task.

According to one embodiment of the invention the physical infrastructure may be organized into a computing block based infrastructure wherein physical infrastructure units are characterized by repeatable units of construction based having similar performance operational characteristics and discrete requirements of power space and cooling that facilitate rapid deployment integration and scalability. The computing block based infrastructure is configured to dynamically provision hardware resources based on performance demands placed on the physical infrastructure . One such example of physical infrastructure is a Vblock Infrastructure Platform available from the VCE Company LLC.

Hardware resources further include an infrastructure manager configured to manage the configuration provisioning and policy compliance of the physical infrastructure . Infrastructure manager provides an interface by which provisioning of hardware resources e.g. computing networking storage may be managed with policy based automation. One example of an infrastructure manager includes EMC Ionix Unified Infrastructure Manager UIM available from EMC Corporation. Similarly network includes a network manager configured to configure network devices e.g. switches routers and manage addressing subnets virtual local area networks VLANs and other network configurations. One example of a network manager includes a Cisco Switch accessible via a Cisco IOS command line interface CLI available from Cisco System Inc.

The virtualized platform includes a virtualization environment configured to simulate i.e. to virtualize conventional components of a computing device e.g. a processor system memory a hard disk drive for executing one or more virtual machines to . For example each virtual machine may include a virtual processor and a virtual system memory configured to execute an application e.g. web application . In one example implementation of an embodiment similar to that of virtualization environment may be implemented by running VMware vSphere or VMware ESX based hypervisor technologies on servers to provided by VMware Inc. of Palo Alto Calif. although it should be recognized that any other virtualization technologies including Xen and Microsoft Hyper V virtualization technologies may be utilized consistent with the teachings herein . In one embodiment virtualized platform including VMs to may be configured as a cloud application platform such as the VMware vFabric cloud application platform available from VMware Inc.

Virtualization environment additionally includes an orchestration manager e.g. implemented as a process running in a virtual machine in one embodiment that monitors the infrastructure resource consumption levels and requirements of virtualization environment . For example if virtualized platform requires additional VMs to host newly deployed web applications or to scale currently running web applications to support peak performance demands orchestration manager can manage the instantiation and configuration of additional virtual machines to support such needs. In one example the orchestration manager may be a virtualization management platform such as the VMware vCenter virtualized management platform from available from VMware Inc. of Palo Alto Calif.

The computing platform further includes a platform manager e.g. executing on one or more VMs configured to manage administrative access to components of computing platform e.g. virtualization environment hardware resources network . Platform manager provides a logical control layer by which a user e.g. developer or administrator of enterprise may manage components of computing platform . Platform manager stores administrative credentials for components of computing platform . Administrative credentials may include value pairs such as usernames and passwords but may also include other suitable authentication mechanisms such as shared key pairs digital signatures tokens etc.

Platform manager includes a task orchestrator that communicates with administrative components of the virtualized platform and physical infrastructure e.g. orchestration manager infrastructure manager network manager using corresponding administrative credentials to execute one or more administrative tasks. For example task orchestrator may transmit one or more commands to orchestration manager to clone a VM create a VM and or perform other operations that typically require administrative privileges with orchestration manager . In another example task orchestrator may transmit commands to infrastructure manager to provision a physical blade server having a predetermined service profile install a virtualization environment on a provisioned server launch a server with particular software packages therein installed and other operations that require administrative privileges with infrastructure manager . In yet another example task orchestrator may communicate with network manager to create one or more VLANs configure routing to a network and other operations that require administrative privileges with network manager .

Platform manager is configured to create and manage personas for administrating components of the computing platform e.g. virtualization environment hardware resources network . Personas represent a federated identity for a group of one or more users with transitory authorization to perform administrative tasks on components of the computing platform e.g. virtualization environment hardware resources network without explicit knowledge of administrative credentials normally required to perform said administrative tasks. Users that are granted membership to or adopt a persona may perform operations on the computing platform using the transitory administrative privileges delegated to them by the personas . For example a cloud admin persona may be created with cloud related privileges e.g. from a cloud controller to execute tasks such as deploying an application from a code repository and granting firewall exceptions to freely access an external library site e.g. rubygems.org . In the described example developers or even administrators can then be added to this cloud admin persona be able to deploy application on a cloud computing environment.

While the platform manager is depicted as a single entity in for the sake of discussion it is understood that platform manager represents one or more server and or server applications that may be implemented using a variety of architectures and configurations having multiple components modules and or servers in communication. For example the task orchestrator of the platform manager may be implemented in one dedicated server or virtual machine and management of personas and users by the platform manager may be implemented in a separate interface.

Operations of platform manager are described in further detail in . is a flow diagram of method steps for managing administrative access to the computing platform of according to certain aspects of the present disclosure. In one example an enterprise wishes to develop and deploy a web application or any other application on the computing platform to be accessed by end users . The enterprise may include users such as administrator who have knowledge and access to administrative credentials for the computing platform . Such users are given a platform administrator role that enables them to configure the platform manager as described in the operations of . Other users such as developer do not have knowledge or access and are otherwise not permitted to view administrative credentials . Such users are given a platform user role which may adopt personas according to techniques described herein.

In step an administrator operating an administrative client may provide one or more administrative credentials for tiered computing components of computing platform to platform manager . In step the platform manager verifies the received administrative credentials by attempting to login into each tiered computing component. In step each of tiered computing components e.g. orchestration manager infrastructure manager network manager authenticates each login connection attempt using the received administrative credentials and transmits an indication of successful login back to platform manager . In step the platform manager securely stores the administrative credentials for tiered computing components of the computing platform in a data store for example such as a database table as shown in .

In step the administrator provides a definition of a persona to platform manager which includes a set of administrative tasks authorized for execution by any users adopting the persona . In step platform manager generates a plurality of personas each persona defining a different set of administrative tasks that a user having a persona is permitted to carry out. In one embodiment the set of administrative tasks may be organized into blueprints which represent a package of administrative tasks to perform an application lifecycle operation such as deploying or upgrading an application. Platform manager may be utilized to create and modify blueprints as well as invoke e.g. execute administrative tasks of the blueprint and expire e.g. cease execution of administrative tasks of the blueprint blueprints. Accordingly by packaging administrative tasks into blueprints platform users may indirectly operate the tiered components of the computing platform without need to know any specific administrative credentials .

In step administrator selects a user to be associated with a persona to allow the selected user to carry out the set of administrative tasks defined by the persona. In step responsive to user input platform manager generates a mapping between the selected user and the persona to authorize the selected user to perform the set of administrative tasks. Accordingly in one example a user having a persona may utilize the platform manager to invoke a blueprint which in turn triggers deployment of an application.

The platform manager stores a data structure embodied as a database table that includes information regarding a plurality of personas configured to provide administrative access to tiered computing components. According to one embodiment the personas are associated with one or more administrative tasks that a user having the corresponding persona may be authorized to carry out. For example a persona identified as Persona in is associated with administrative tasks to provision one or more physical blades to install VMware ESX environment on the physical blade and to create one or more virtual machines. Each of the described administrative tasks may require use of the one or more administrative credentials in table .

Platform manager further stores a data structure embodied as a database table that includes mappings between users e.g. developers and personas . Each user persona mapping may include a time constraint that represents a time interval for which the mapping is valid. For example upon expiry of the time constraint a user having adopted a particular persona may no longer be authorized to carry out a set of administrative tasks associated with the persona. In an alternative embodiment each user persona mapping may include a time constraint that represents a time interval by which effects of administrative tasks performed under a given persona are permitted to persist. For example for a user persona mapping having a time constraint of 48 days any computing resources e.g. virtual machines database instances provisioned under the user persona mapping may persist for a period no longer than 48 days. Upon expiry of the specified time constraint computing resources for example may be de allocated and returned to a pool of available resources.

In step the IDE may request execution of one or more administrative tasks to manage the lifecycle of the web application . For example the developer may operate the IDE to package the web application transmit the packaged application to platform manager and request deployment of the packaged application onto one or more virtual machines of the computing platform . In step the platform manager receives a request from the developer to carry out administrative tasks on one or more tiered computing components. For example t deployment request may include one or more administrative tasks such as the provisioning of virtual machines an allocation of network addresses configuration of routers to direct requests to the provisioned virtual machine at the allocated network address and other similar release management operations.

In step the platform manager determines a persona associated with the user if any and a set of administrative tasks that can be carried out by users associated with the persona. In step responsive to determining that one or more of the requested administrative tasks are not authorized for the persona and in turn for the requesting developer the platform manager returns an error message indicating lack of authorization back to IDE . In step the IDE receives the status of the execution of the administrative tasks. Upon receipt of an error message indicating lack of authorization the developer may take remedial action such as requesting membership of a persona having authorization to execute the administrative tasks to deploy the web application .

Alternatively in step responsive to determining that the requested administrative tasks are authorized for the persona and in turn the developer the platform manager determines administrative credentials that may be necessary to invoke administrative privilege and carry out the administrative tasks on behalf of the developer . In step the platform manager transmits commands using via REST Representational State Transfer APIs Application Programming Interface or any other client server communication protocols and messaging interfaces to connect to the appropriate tiered computing component of the computing platform e.g. orchestration manager infrastructure manager network manager and execute the administrative tasks.

In step the tiered computing component e.g. orchestration manager infrastructure manager network manager receives commands and administrative credentials from the platform manager . In step the tiered computing component authenticates the administrative credentials to earn elevated privileges that are used to execute the received commands from the platform manager . In step the tiered computing component transmits status of the executed command back to the platform manager for example to indicate successful completion of the command and or provide other status output resultant from the executed command.

In step the platform manager forwards the received status of execution back to the IDE and developer . As described above in step the IDE receives status of execution of the administrative tasks which may include for example an indication of a successful deployment of the web application .

Accordingly embodiments of the invention provide an enterprise access control and enforcement mechanism for users to perform administrative operations or tasks without knowing administrative credentials. Embodiments of the invention enable certain users e.g. administrators to determine and describe what abilities a persona has and to continue to determine which users in an enterprise may be part of the persona thereby preserving traditional IT privileged roles while enable rapid deployment in cloud computing environments.
