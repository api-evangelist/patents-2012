This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 512 329 entitled IDENTIFICATION OF ROGUE SOCIAL MEDIA ASSETS filed Jul. 27 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

Social media includes various forms of electronic media for social interaction. Social media typically involves the use of social networks based on social graphs that can use various highly accessible and scalable communication techniques. For example social media can include the use of web based and mobile communication technologies to facilitate communication as well as various forms of interactive dialogue to provide for social interaction.

The invention can be implemented in numerous ways including as a process an apparatus a system a composition of matter a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium and or a processor such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification these implementations or any other form that the invention may take may be referred to as techniques. In general the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein the term processor refers to one or more devices circuits and or processing cores configured to process data such as computer program instructions.

A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.

Social media is an increasingly important medium for communication and marketing. Social media can leverage the dynamic and contextual relevancy of social relationships e.g. using social graphs associated with social identities on various social networks to reach various target audiences such as for targeted marketing or marketing campaigns. For example based on certain knowledge about a potential customer an advertiser can send targeted advertisements and promotions that are tailored for the potential customer s needs or interests. Because targeted marketing tends to yield better results for the advertiser than traditional non targeted marketing targeted marketing can be an effective way for businesses to spend their advertising budget. Social networking can also leverage network effects to efficiently and effectively increase the depth and relevance of such communication and or marketing efforts using various forms of social media assets.

A variety of different social networks exist e.g. Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google and various other social networks are available . These social networks can be used to provide social media assets for entities such as corporations educational institutions governmental organizations trade groups ad hoc consortia user groups individual persons e.g. athletes celebrities politicians business leaders and or any other persons and or other forms of entities or groups interested in using social media assets as a communication medium and or marketing medium and or for commercial brand names or trade names. However almost any person can use such social networks to create a social media asset that can be associated or appear to be associated with the entity e.g. a Twitter handle that appears to be associated with the entity such as twitter.com ENTITY NAME or a Facebook page for a user that appears to be for a person associated with the entity such as www.facebook.com ENTITY NAME . For example a customer of a company e.g. who likes products from a particular corporation or who dislikes product from that corporation can create a social identity on one or more social networks which can appear to be a social identity associated with the company. As another example an employee of the corporation e.g. a sales employee or a marketing employee can create a social identity on one or more social networks which can appear to be a social identity of a person associated with the company. However the corporation may not even be aware of the existence of these social identities. Also the corporation cannot marshal such social media assets in order to manage these social assets e.g. to ensure compliance with various business rules or policies of the corporation and or to advantageously use such social media assets for various communication and or marketing efforts .

As such existing techniques generally do not adequately meet the requirements of entities e.g. businesses educational institutions governmental institutions or other organizations that need to accurately identify social media assets that are associated with their entity and or to identify social media assets that are not properly authorized to be associated with their entity e.g. rogue social media assets . Existing techniques also do not adequately meet the requirements of businesses that need to more effectively manage social media assets that are associated with their entity.

Accordingly identification of rogue social media assets is provided. In some embodiments identification of rogue social media assets includes identifying a plurality of social media assets comparing the plurality of social media assets with known social media assets to identify previously unknown social media assets and displaying the identified previously unknown social media assets.

In some embodiments identification of rogue social media assets further includes receiving a confirmation input that at least one of the identified previously unknown social media assets is a rogue social media asset.

In some embodiments identification of rogue social media assets further includes receiving an input to add at least one of the identified previously unknown social media assets to the known social media assets in which the known social media assets are managed social media assets e.g. automatically monitored to identify and report periodically and or based on an event trigger s compliance and or violations based on various standard and or configurable business rules and or policies for social media assets .

In some embodiments identification of rogue social media assets includes a rogue page finder that systematically identifies social media pages that represent for example a company s brand but remain outside corporate control. In some embodiments infractions on managed and or identified rogue pages e.g. some of which could subject the company to fines or other risks are also monitored and can be displayed e.g. in a report alert dashboard and or other output or notification .

Processor is coupled bidirectionally with memory which can include a first primary storage typically a random access memory RAM and a second primary storage area typically a read only memory ROM . As is well known in the art primary storage can be used as a general storage area and as scratch pad memory and can also be used to store input data and processed data. Primary storage can also store programming instructions and data in the form of data objects and text objects in addition to other data and instructions for processes operating on processor . Also as well known in the art primary storage typically includes basic operating instructions program code data and objects used by the processor to perform its functions e.g. programmed instructions . For example primary storage devices can include any suitable non transitory computer readable storage media described below depending on whether for example data access needs to be bidirectional or unidirectional. For example processor can also directly and very rapidly retrieve and store frequently needed data in a cache memory not shown .

A removable mass storage device provides additional data storage capacity for the computer system and is coupled either bidirectionally read write or unidirectionally read only to processor . For example storage can also include computer readable media such as magnetic tape flash memory PC cards portable mass storage devices holographic storage devices and other storage devices. A fixed mass storage can also for example provide additional data storage capacity. The most common example of mass storage is a hard disk drive. Mass storage generally store additional programming instructions data and the like that typically are not in active use by the processor . It will be appreciated that the information retained within mass storage can be incorporated if needed in standard fashion as part of primary storage e.g. RAM as virtual memory.

In addition to providing processor access to storage subsystems bus can be used to provide access to other subsystems and devices as well. As shown these can include a display monitor a network interface a keyboard and a pointing device as well as an auxiliary input output device interface a sound card speakers and other subsystems as needed. For example the pointing device can be a mouse stylus track ball or tablet and is useful for interacting with a graphical user interface.

The network interface allows processor to be coupled to another computer computer network or telecommunications network using a network connection as shown. For example through the network interface the processor can receive information e.g. data objects or program instructions from another network or output information to another network in the course of performing method process steps. Information often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed on a processor can be received from and outputted to another network. An interface card or similar device and appropriate software implemented by e.g. executed performed on processor can be used to connect the computer system to an external network and transfer data according to standard protocols. For example various process embodiments disclosed herein can be executed on processor or can be performed across a network such as the Internet intranet networks or local area networks in conjunction with a remote processor that shares a portion of the processing. Additional mass storage devices not shown can also be connected to processor through network interface .

An auxiliary I O device interface not shown can be used in conjunction with computer system . The auxiliary I O device interface can include general and customized interfaces that allow the processor to send and more typically receive data from other devices such as microphones touch sensitive displays transducer card readers tape readers voice or handwriting recognizers biometric readers cameras portable mass storage devices and other computers.

In addition various embodiments disclosed herein further relate to computer storage products with a computer readable medium that includes program code for performing various computer implemented operations. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to all the media mentioned above magnetic media such as hard disks floppy disks and magnetic tape optical media such as CD ROM disks magneto optical media such as optical disks and specially configured hardware devices such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs programmable logic devices PLDs and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of program code include both machine code as produced for example by a compiler or files containing higher level code e.g. script that can be executed using an interpreter.

The computer system shown in is but an example of a computer system suitable for use with the various embodiments disclosed herein. Other computer systems suitable for such use can include additional or fewer subsystems. In addition bus is illustrative of any interconnection scheme serving to link the subsystems. Other computer architectures having different configurations of subsystems can also be utilized e.g. server devices appliances with hardware configured for specific functions such as a web server or an application server and or various other types of computing devices that can execute various operating systems and or virtual machine software techniques .

For example the unknown social media assets can be displayed using the portal . The authorized user for the entity e.g. social media asset management administrator admin can identify whether or not such assets are associated with the entity and authorized by the entity e.g. and the known social media assets and unknown social media assets can be updated accordingly . The authorized user for the entity can then also indicate whether any of the known and or unknown social media assets sets should be monitored and which monitoring policies should be applied e.g. business rules and or compliance policies according to a specified monitoring criteria e.g. time based such as once per day or once per week or event based such as upon request by the admin or another event based trigger . In some embodiments the business rules and or compliance policies can include various pre configured or default rules e.g. a list of keywords such as certain profanity terms religious terms political terms legal terms and or other terms and can also include various configurable rules e.g. to search for the use of certain keywords such as guaranteed or names of certain competitors . In some embodiments the authorized user can create new business rules and or customized compliance policies using the portal . In some embodiments regional based monitoring compliance policies can be applied to social media assets based on the associated region e.g. to apply region based customized polices and or to address regional based regulatory compliance requirements .

In some embodiments the rogue social media asset identifier engine analyzes components of various social media assets and generates reports that can also be based on a component level. For example a Facebook page can include various tabs. The rogue social media asset identifier engine can report rogue tabs of various social media assets. The portal can then also allow authorized users to view reports of any such rogue tabs and configure the monitoring and or management of such rogue tabs. Similar techniques can be applied to various other component levels supported by other forms of social media assets e.g. using public APIs or other techniques to crawl identify and monitor such components .

In some embodiments the portal displays compliance reports for managed social media assets. For example known social media assets and or identified rogue social media assets can be monitored and social media crawler e.g. or another similar function or component can be used to apply a compliance policy to the monitored social media assets. The portal can display reports that indicate which monitored social media assets are out of compliance with the compliance policy e.g. various compliance policies can be applied to different social media assets using for example key words and or regular expression based techniques to determine whether various rules associated with each applied compliance policy have been violated .

In some embodiments the rogue social media asset management platform can be accessed using a programming interface such as an application programming interface API e.g. a private API or a public API . For example another application can access the rogue social media asset management platform via an API that allows for displaying some or all of the information as similarly described herein and or for configuring and interacting with some or all of the functionality as similarly described herein.

In some embodiments the portal is provided for use by authorized users e.g. social media asset management admins for the entity for identifying rogue social media assets and or managing social media assets for the entity. The portal can allow the user to view an output of potentially rogue social media assets e.g. on demand based on a periodic reporting or event based reporting configuration setting s . The portal can also allow the user to select one or more of the potentially rogue social media assets for various actions. For example the user can select an identified potentially rogue social media asset and provide a confirmation input to verify that the identified potentially rogue social media asset is a rogue social media asset or to indicate that the social media asset is not a rogue social media asset e.g. but should be added to a monitored or managed social media asset list and to possibly trigger a workflow to determine an authorized owner or responsible owner for managing the social media asset for the entity . A list of confirmed rogue social media assets can then be displayed e.g. displayed or output in a potentially rogue social media assets log report and or other form of notification or output . The authorized user can also select and or configure various monitoring policies for continuing to monitor confirmed rogue social media assets.

In some cases a confirmed rogue social media asset can be reported to an admin at the entity responsible for managing social media assets. The confirmed rogue social media asset may be a candidate for reporting to the entity s legal department e.g. to determine whether or not a cease and desist letter or take down notice request should be issued for that rogue social media asset . The confirmed rogue social media asset may be an unauthorized social media asset that is associated with an employee of the entity but which is not authorized to be associated with the entity e.g. violates a social media asset business rule or policy such as certain employees may not be permitted to post certain content associated with the entity . In that case the employee and or a management contact for the employee can be contacted and informed of the social media asset compliance policy. In some cases a rogue social media asset can be monitored to determine a region associated with the rogue social media asset e.g. California United States South Korea Germany and or any other geographical region using various techniques e.g. geographical information or content on the social media asset IP address information or host information or user associated with the social media asset and or various other techniques . If a region can be determined for the rogue social media asset then the entity can apply a monitoring action policy that assigns an appropriate regional social media asset admin to be responsible for addressing the rogue social media asset. In some cases a name of the person identified as the owner sponsor and or otherwise associated with the rogue social media asset can be compared against the entity s employee list to determine whether or not the rogue social media asset can be determined to potentially be associated with a current e.g. or possibly former employee of the entity. Various other monitoring action policies can be applied based on a categorization of the social media asset and or based on various other criteria rules and or heuristics that can be configured and or customized for the entity.

Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding the invention is not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways of implementing the invention. The disclosed embodiments are illustrative and not restrictive.
