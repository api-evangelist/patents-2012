This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 545 685 filed Oct. 11 2011 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to the field of entertainment systems and more particularly to a system apparatus and method for configuring a wireless sound reinforcement system.

Music and entertainment systems in general are mostly a tangled web of cords. For example cords to connect guitars to amps cords to connect speakers to sound reinforcement systems etc. Cords are used for everything. Although there have been a number of wireless solutions over the years that free musicians from their cords these solutions have been limited to wireless microphones and wireless guitar transmitters. These wireless devices mostly use standard UHF or VHF frequencies to transmit and receive analog data although some of them are now starting to be digitally controlled.

A sound reinforcement system is an arrangement of microphones electronic signal processors amplifiers and loudspeakers that makes live or pre recorded sounds usually music or speech louder or that distributes the sound to a larger or more distant audience. A sound reinforcement system can simple such as a small public address PA system in a coffeehouse consisting of a single microphone connected to a self powered 100 watt loudspeaker system or very complex such as hundreds of microphones complex mixing and signal processing systems tens of thousands of watts of amplification and multiple loudspeaker arrays all overseen by a team of audio engineers and technicians e.g. a famous entertainer or group performing a concert in a large arena or stadium . In both cases these sound reinforcement systems reinforce sound to make it louder or distribute it to a wider audience.

Normally when the band sets up they arrange their instruments and instrument amplifiers on the stage. Once this is set up they mic up which means that microphones and other forms of input are placed strategically to pick up the sounds emanating from the instrument amps drums vocals etc. and physically connected to the mixing console. The mixing console has a plurality of audio channels each dedicated to a single input instrument sound source of some kind etc. . The outputs of the mixing console are routed to typically stereo channels which are then sent to an amplification system. This mixing board also known as a soundboard is wired to either power amplifiers which are then wired to speakers or powered speakers which have built in amplification that are generally pointed away from the stage and towards the audience.

At the same time on the stage a plurality of wires bundled together and terminated with an input box provides localized input for microphone cables and other sound sources. This device is commonly referred to as a snake. The snake is then routed to the mixing board and each wire on the snake is plugged into the input of the corresponding channel on the board. In essence the snake provides remote input jacks for the board. The setup process can be extensive and quite time consuming depending upon the complexity of the gear and size of the show. Numerous cables must be removed from storage containers road cases uncoiled and connected to the various pieces. Furthermore at the conclusion of the show all of this must be broken down. Despite improvements such as digital analog conversion these configurations are basically the same as it has been for 50 years or more and are costly and time consuming to set up and tear down as most musicians and roadies will explain. For example the setup and teardown on large complex shows can cost into the tens of thousands and sometimes a lot more. Much of this is due to extensive cabling that must be run.

A wireless musical instrument transmitter and receiver such as a wireless microphone is a microphone or body pack without a physical cable connecting it directly to the sound recording or amplifying equipment with which it is associated. The musician generally plugs the body pack into the instrument via an analog cord that accepts the signal from the electric device such as a guitar . As the musician plays the instrument the signal is transmitted to the receiver which is then plugged into for example the musician s guitar amplifier. Typically these systems utilize UHF or VHF frequencies and have recently started to integrate audio digital and digital audio converters ADC DAC . ADC DAC encodes the analog sound to digital signals before transmitting them to the receiver where they are then converted back to analog signals before being output. However these wireless systems are subject to RF interference tend to be unreliable and provide lower quality than wired systems. Other limitations include range limitations latency limitations on the number of wireless devices at a performance etc.

As a result there is a need for a wireless entertainment system that eliminates the complex cabling required in large sound reinforcement systems while preserving the quality and low latency requirements demanded by performers and their audiences.

The present invention provides a wireless entertainment system that eliminates the complex cabling required in large sound reinforcement systems while preserving the quality and low latency requirements demanded by performers and their audiences.

More specifically the present invention provides a method for configuring a wireless sound reinforcement system by detecting a controller and two or more wireless adapters using a router.

A destination network address of each received data packet is identified and each received data packet is sent to the identified destination network address. The foregoing method can be implemented as a computer program embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium for execution by a computer or processor such that the steps are implemented as one or more code segments.

In addition the present invention provides a wireless sound reinforcement router that includes a wireless transceiver a network interface a memory and a processor communicably coupled to the wireless transceiver the network interface and the memory.

The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention and do not delimit the scope of the invention. The discussion herein relates primarily to sound reinforcement systems but it will be understood that the concepts of the present invention are applicable to any type of entertainment system.

The present invention provides a system and technology platform referred to as WiDi Wireless Instrument Digital Interface . Broadly speaking the present invention turns musical instruments into streaming Internet Protocol IP enabled instruments that communicate with a router which can be separate or integrated into a soundboard. Note that one skilled in the art can adapt the present invention to work with other communication protocols existing now or developed in the future. Using the present invention an entire orchestra could be wireless 

Now referring to a block diagram of a wireless sound reinforcement system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The wireless sound reinforcement system includes two or more entertainment devices a router and a controller . The entertainment devices can be a microphone e.g. a speaker e.g. and a display a headset an earpiece a musical instrument e.g. guitar drum set an amplifier a body pack a foot pedal a recording device a teleprompter a monitor a display screen a projector a television a light a lighting system a laser a smoke machine a pyrotechnics device a platform or stage moving device an audio device a video device an audio video device an audio effects device a visual effects device or a combination thereof. Each entertainment device has a network adapter that is integrated into the entertainment device e.g. and attached to the entertainment device e.g. and or connected to the entertainment device e.g. with a cable . The router will be described in more detail below. The controller can be a computer a mixer a soundboard a recording console an event audio visual control panel s or other suitable device to control a performance of the two or more entertainment devices . The controller has a plurality of input channels and output channels. The controller can be an off the shelf device or a controller that is specifically designed to interface with the router of the present invention. The system may also include one or more access points communicably coupled between the wireless adapters of the entertainment devices and a network interface not shown of the router via a cable or one or more wireless repeaters communicably coupled between the wireless adapters of the entertainment devices and a transceiver not shown of the router. The dashed lines indicate wireless communication links . Note that entertainment devices may also be connected to the router using cables. The wireless adapters may also communicate with one or more peripheral devices e.g. via wireless communication links e.g. or cables not shown . The one or more peripheral devices can be a microphone a display a headset an earpiece an amplifier a body pack a foot pedal a teleprompter a monitor a display screen or other suitable device. Note that the wireless adapter can communicate with the router using a first communication protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 etc. and the one or more peripheral devices using a second communication protocol e.g. Bluetooth etc. .

The network interface not shown of the router is communicably coupled to the controller via one or more cables . Cables can be single or multiple optical Ethernet or other suitable communication cable. Note that integrating the router into the controller can eliminate cables . Moreover the controller can be configured such that the router plugs into a router interface of the controller . One or more remote controllers may be communicably coupled to the controller or the router . The remote controller s can be a handheld computer a mobile computing device a mobile phone a handheld tablet a laptop or a combination thereof. The remote controllers can be used to monitor the performance and communicate with controller or change one or more parameters based on information detected measured or obtained from areas away from the controller e.g. backstage rafters top row etc. . In addition one or more recording or data storage devices can be communicably coupled to the router or controller to record the performance of the entertainment devices operational data logs diagnostics or other desirable data. The router or controller may also have sufficient data storage capacity to record such information. The router and or the controller may also be connected to another network e.g. Internet LAN WAN etc. such that the performance can be transmitted broadcast or recorded by one or more remote devices .

Referring now to a block diagram of a wireless sound reinforcement router in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. Router includes one or more wireless transceivers a network interface a memory and a processor . The processor is communicably coupled to the wireless transceiver the network interface and the memory . The router may also include a user interface one or more input output I O ports or connectors a power supply and various other components as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The router may also be communicably coupled to a network switch or integrated with the network switch. The router provides bidirectional communications using two or more communication channels between the controller and the entertainment devices via the wireless adapters . Note that wired entertainment devices can be connected to the router via the network interface or an addressable I O port . The network interface can also be used to connect to another internal or external network.

Now referring to a block diagram of a wireless adapter in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The wireless adapter includes a wireless transceiver a memory an analog output a digital to analog converter DAC communicably coupled to the analog output an analog input an analog to digital converter ADC communicably coupled to the analog input and a processor communicably coupled to the wireless transceiver the memory the digital to analog converter and the analog to digital converter . The wireless adapter may also include a user interface communicably coupled to the processor a digital output communicably coupled to the processor and a power supply . Note that the digital to analog converter and the analog to digital converter can be integrated into the processor . Other components can be used.

In one simplified example the wireless adapter is a wireless body pack that contains two primary components 1 a radio transceiver which uses one or more of the IEEE 802.x WiFi Internet standards and 2 an analog to digital converter . In addition it contains two or more bi directional data channels which enables the device to communicate much like a computer. So for example the same body pack that is transmitting the digital guitar audio could also receive a monitor mix that is being sent from the router sound console. One chipset that can be used is STS Wireless s fourth generation wireless chip which delivers audio up to 150 feet throughout a house or up to 500 feet outdoors. Longer range is available with a wireless repeater. It supports up to eight simultaneous channels of uncompressed 96 kHz 24 bit CD quality audio and its bidirectional feature allows for use in VoIP devices.

The transceiver can be programmed or set to operate in a receive only mode transmit only mode or a normal mode. The normal mode transmit and receive will generally be preferable. The ADC converts analog audio signals through the analog input into digital signals. The DAC converts digital signals such as the previously digitized audio signal or messages commands instructions or other information into analog signals. The digitized audio signal or messages commands instructions or other information may also be provided to the digital output . The processor with firmware handles the processing of encapsulating the digital audio into packets suitable for routing on the network. Think of the transceiver unit as a self contained miniature computer whose express function is to provide input and output.

The device through firmware and a simple hardware user interface with visual display is programmed with a TCP IP address to identify and connect it to the network either manually or through DHCP. The transceiver is tied to the DA converter. This is a standard chipset described above that converts an analog signal into digital audio of which there are several commercially available to choose from. Through the circuit board converted data is encapsulated into packets for streaming over the network. The packets are then further encapsulated into TCP IP packets which are then transmitted wirelessly via the radio transceiver .

Simultaneous to packets being sent outbound the device also has two to four or more data channels where the device may receive information for further processing. This can include for example teleprompter MIDI music instrument digital interface for controlling midi compliant devices digital audio monitors for wireless monitoring of audio instead of floor monitors etc. The transceiver unit itself may be embedded or integrated directly into the device it is processing or it may be worn as described above as a bodypack. For example it may be completely encased in custom designed speakers guitars mics amplifiers pedal boards and numerous other devices.

Referring now to a flow chart of a method for configuring a wireless sound reinforcement system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. Also referring to the processor detects the controller and the wireless adapters in block . Channel information about each input channel and output channel is obtained from the controller in block . Device information is obtained from each entertainment device via the wireless adapter in block . The processor assigns a network address to each input channel of the controller each output channel of the controller and each wireless adapter in block and maps each entertainment device to at least one of the input channels and or output channels of the controller in block . The device information and the channel mappings for the entertainment devices are provided to the controller in block . Thereafter the processor receives one or more data packets from the wireless adapters and the controller in block identifies a destination network address of each received data packet in block and sends each received data packet to the identified destination network address in block . Note that the data packets can be encrypted and or compressed. Moreover the router may include a firewall or other security features to prevent unauthorized access to the router controller wireless adapters or entertainment devices . The foregoing steps can be all performed automatically without any user input. Alternatively a setup program can be run that guides a user through accepting changing or rejecting the device information and or the channel mappings via the user interface of the router or the controller . The user interface of the router or the controller can also be used to make one or more modifications to the device information and or the channel mappings. The foregoing method can be implemented as a computer program embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium for execution by a computer or processor such that the steps are implemented as one or more code segments.

The router is integrated with digital audio components to convert and route digital audio packets through to their destinations. In one example when router is turned on it is configured to automatically assign network e.g. Internet Protocol addresses to entertainment devices and through an integrated web server built into the device . For example the IP address assignments can be 

Simultaneously the router maps the IP addresses to channels on the soundboard . If the router is already on and a given device is turned on for example a wireless body pack attached to a guitar the router automatically detects the device and assigns an IP address to the device using industry standard DHCP served through the router . When the link is made the router automatically determines what the device is and assigns it a channel. In addition the router can provide device information such as the device name e.g. Zach s Guitar to the soundboard for display on the channel listing. The router employs packet switching technology to reduce or eliminate packet collisions and therefore delivers near zero latency performance. Quality of Service QoS and packet prioritization can also be used. The router eliminates the need for complex cabling and enables numerous benefits such as audio channel auto assignment bi directional data transfer and more. For example a performer could have a small screen on his guitar with lyrics or tab or the system could route information and music to in ear monitors using the same device.

The router and wireless adapters connected to the entertainment devices can employ any known or future wireless digital communication standard such as 802.11 Bluetooth WiGig etc. In this manner numerous devices may be turned on and assigned channels . These devices would be interference free because they are 100 digital. This also includes powered speakers so that a wireless signal may be sent and no wires would need to be run. The present invention provides the capability to route wireless instrument traffic over any network architecture. Moreover the router can employ multiple frequencies protocols and sophisticated frequency and time domain techniques to eliminate or reduce interference and packet collisions. The system is modular in that it is designed to be transportable across multiple wireless packet based technologies or frequencies in the event a next generation communications platform is developed.

For example let s say we have a guitar that has uses the present invention and a mixing console that has a built in wireless instrument digital router router . The player switches on his guitar pack. It automatically gets a TCP IP address from the router which is the mixing console . The console assigns the player a channel and his name hostname appears in the display of the channel. Presto No snake multi channel wire that goes from stage to console Further implications include memory settings in the console for that instrument etc.

In another example when Joe the guitar player turns on his rig the mixing console router automatically syncs with his guitar recognizes it through bi direction communication and automatically assigns a channel on the console to his guitar. As the sound engineer the guy who makes it sound good live watches his console up pops Joe s guitar on a channel strip requiring no further setup. At the same time as the large powered public address PA speakers are set up and turned on these also automatically sync to the board and require no wires other than the AC power required to run them.

Take it from there and imagine an entire band that is wireless including not only the instruments but also the speakers. All of a sudden you now have a solution to the age old problem of PAs with wires. Take it further and you have the ability to digitally lay tracks anywhere in the world with nominal issues. Of course the present invention will accept wired instruments through the console but these connections can be digital instead of analog.

Generally speaking a wireless router is a network device that routes IP traffic across several wireless IP networks and wired networks utilizing the 802.11x wireless standard WiFi technology . Wireless routers are used to build independent WLANs that can communicate with each other and the Internet. Some access points can function either as a wireless gateway or wireless router while other devices function solely as a wireless router. Devices communicate with the router via a wireless network adapter that is either built into the device or utilizes one of the devices available PCI slots or USB ports. A typical wireless router is capable of routing Internet traffic to 254 unique private IP addresses using IPv4 and can automatically assign IP addresses to these devices or they can be manually assigned .

Packets of data from one computer system are sent to another computer system using the IP addresses of each device. Additionally each device has a MAC address which is the physical ID of the actual interface. Every device that communicates on the Internet or Intranet usually a private firewalled network has an IP address. Essentially a wireless device such as a wireless Internet card is a transceiver which means it is a radio that sends and receives signals much like a walkie talkie but more sophisticated .

The router would also contain wired connections that would be standard Gigabit Ethernet ports. These ports would allow the user to connect other devices such as light controllers power amps etc. ALL of which could be WiDi enabled. Additionally the router would have the capability to uplink to the web creating an instant method for aggregating digital music potentially mixing it and delivering it simultaneously and remotely to distant destinations. It would also allow incoming connections from musicians who may be elsewhere and would include compensation algorithms for any latency.

The router may also perform many other functions such as configuring the router based on one or more settings and perform one or more diagnostic tests whenever the router is turned on reset or restarted. In addition the processor of the router automatically detects e.g. by scanning for new adapters a new wireless adapter associated with a new entertainment device obtains device information from the new entertainment device via the new wireless adapter assigns a new network address to the new wireless adapter maps the new entertainment device to at least one of the input channels and or output channels of the controller provides the device information and the channel mapping for the new entertainment device to the controller . The router can also be used to change one or more characteristics of at least one of the entertainment devices using the controller . The one or more characteristics may include a delay a reverberation an amplification a pitch a tuning or other adjustable or programmable aspect of the entertainment device . The device information and the channel mappings for the entertainment devices can be saved locally or remotely. Moreover a program can be used to control at least one of the entertainment devices . In addition one or more diagnostics can be performed on at least one of the entertainment devices using the controller .

An example will now be described. In a typical wired world a four piece band consisting of drums bass guitar and vocals would amplify their instruments through a PA system. This system which as described above is typically called sound reinforcement allows the band to amplify and mix their sound. This can be for anything from a large arena to a small club. The typical gear involved in this kind of setup including the instruments would be Guitar and amplifier Bass and amplifier Microphone for vocals Microphones for amps Microphones for drums Mixing console sometimes called a mixing board Outboard effects processing devices PA Amplifiers and Left and Right PA speakers.

In a WiDi configuration in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the standard mixing console for example would be replaced by a WiDi enabled integrated mixing console and digital WiDi router all input devices would be fitted or equipped with WiDi transceivers as well as speakers and amps. The devices themselves would be either hard coded with IP addresses or would work with DHCP served up from the console router. As each component comes up pre programmed channels sync with the instrument and all previously stored information is retrieved for quick setup. When a device is played or mic is used the signal is routed wirelessly through the console router to the speakers where the sound is amplified for the audience. This system eliminates most if all wires necessary to provide sound reinforcement.

Another scenario could involve a traveling band with limited production walking into a big venue. The big venue could have some type of Widi router installed permanently and the band could have a similar unit that would sync to it. This would allow quick configuration when in fact the band is not carrying the complete system and or the venue does not have an installed system. This saves time and provides consistency security and reliability in that a Band s settings will remain the same. In addition big equipment suppliers such as clair rent out their gear for large venues so the band can have a component that seamlessly plugs into the rented gear and saves and uploads one or more performance configurations specifically setup for the band.

The router controllers can be manually configured such that configurations scenes event ambiance or other aspects of a performance can be programmed stored and recalled. This is a pretty standard feature in today s consoles and likewise we should have it too. Not only are the router and controller programmable the router and or controller or storage media can retain the network addresses of the wireless adapters associated with the entertainment devices and the device information for the entertainment devices so that next time you can just pull up the band name Journey and the settings would reappear. For example the band Journey could have a base profile for a tour a base profile for an event location a profile that is specific to the tour and the event location or any other desirable profile. The system can record configurations settings as they are set or changed such that the configuration settings can be stored and replayed. Moreover an application programming interface or other program can be used to assist in the setting up and operation of the present invention. The system will also plug and play with industry standard plug ins devices and software such ProTools and Logic Pro.

The ability of the router to connect to the Internet creates an instant method for aggregating digital music potentially mixing it and delivering it simultaneously and remotely to distant destinations. It also allows incoming connections from musicians who may be elsewhere geographically and would include compensation algorithms for latency.

Now referring to a flow chart of a method for configuring a wireless sound reinforcement system in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The router switch is turned on in block and one or more configuration settings and diagnostics are run in block . If a new device is detected as determined in decision block and the port type is a controller port as determined in decision block channel information about each input channel and output channel is obtained from the controller in block and a network address is assigned to each input channel of the controller and each output channel of the controller in block . Thereafter the process returns to decision block . If however the port type is a device port as determined in decision block a network address is assigned to each wireless adapter in block and device information is obtained from each entertainment device via the wireless adapter in block . Each entertainment device is mapped to at least one of the input channels and or output channels of the controller in block . The device information and the channel mappings for the entertainment devices are provided to the controller in block . Thereafter the process returns to decision block . If however no new device is detected as determined in decision block one or more data packets are received from the wireless adapters and or the controller in block a destination network address of each received data packet is identified in block and each received data packet is sent to the identified destination network address in block . Thereafter the process returns to decision block . Note that the data packets can be encrypted and or compressed. The foregoing method can be implemented as a computer program embodied on a non transitory computer readable medium for execution by a computer or processor such that the steps are implemented as one or more code segments.
