title: Automated security analytics platform with visualization agnostic selection linked portlets
abstract: Visualization agnostic selection linked portlets provide a tree from a parent to one or more children that present each portlet with its own visualization and data synchronized with a root portlet based upon related filters. Each portlet uses its visualization to display a data set derived by applying its filter in conjunction with the filters of its ancestors. Each portlet then presents data that is at most the same size as its root in a visualization adapted to the child's type and quantity of data.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 677 152 entitled Automated Security Analytics Platform With Multi Level Representation Conversion For Space Efficiency And Incremental Persistence inventor Donovan Kolbly filed on same day herewith describes exemplary methods and systems and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates in general to the field of information security and more particularly to an automated security analytics platform.

Information technology has made businesses government and individuals more efficient. Mobile networking allows end users to interact with work government and home resources from almost anywhere and at almost any time. To support networking resources business and government enterprises often employ information technology IT specialists who maintain the networking resources and protect the networking resources and enterprise information from unauthorized access. IT specialists employ a variety of tools to maintain network security such as firewalls intrusion prevention anti virus applications spam sorting applications phishing protection applications identity management security event management etc. . . . Unfortunately conventional network security tools have weaknesses and vulnerabilities that cyber criminals attack and penetrate to access sensitive information.

IT specialists attempt to protect network assets from attacks with conventional network security tools and by monitoring network activity to detect and counteract attacks. For example IT specialists collect network telemetry information such as events flows logs user authorizations and authentications. The network telemetry is stored in a database using conventional database servers that communicate with networking resources. The network telemetry is then retrieved and analyzed to identify unauthorized network accesses and access attempts. Often network telemetry represents a substantial amount of data that the IT specialists sort and process to identify potential security threats. The gathering and analyzing of historical network telemetry to identify security threats enhances conventional security measures however the process takes time and all too often provides information about network security threats only after a security breach has occurred.

Cyber criminals have many advantages in their malicious work against IT security measures. Cyber criminals mount multi stage attacks to pursue financial assets intellectual property network telemetry control and government trade secrets. Rule based security measures can only react to known threats that implicate a rule. Anomaly detection systems help detect new types of attacks however also consume large amounts of data for analysis over lengthy time periods. Thus anomaly detection systems have a delayed response based upon the inherent performance limitations of relational databases to process network information with various known analytics. Policy based devices such as firewalls and identity products suffer from bit rot and configuration errors that leave vulnerabilities waiting for an attacker. Cyber criminals working against conventional network security tools have IT specialists outnumbered and outgunned Cyber criminals patiently tap social media or phishing information with sophisticated tools that enable protracted entry and exfiltration techniques. If IT specialists or enterprise employees make a misstep leave a door ajar or unknowingly provide a copy of the network house keys cyber criminals will eventually find access to network resources.

Therefore a need has arisen for a system and method which provides an automated security analytics platform that protects networking resources from malicious attacks. In accordance with the present invention a system method and machine readable medium are provided which substantially reduce the disadvantages and problems associated with previous methods and systems for protecting networking resources from malicious attacks.

A method system and machine readable medium of one embodiment maintains network security by sensing network telemetry information at plural network resources communicating the network telemetry information to an active memory such as DRAM acting as data memory in support of operation of a processor for use as inputs to network security modules in accordance with input specifications that support logic of a logic specification to provide an output of an output specification for each network security module. Network security is maintained by investigating the network telemetry information with the security modules using network telemetry information stored in active memory and neutralizing threats to the network with security modules in response to detecting predetermined network telemetry information in the active memory. Network security modules activate in response to storage of network telemetry information in predetermined allocated areas of the active memory. A memory allocation module interfaced with the active memory allocates memory areas to network security modules for activation of the network security modules as network resource sensors provide network telemetry information to the active memory. The memory allocation module maintains the active memory to keep network telemetry information up to date by removing older data and allocating memory based upon the usage of network telemetry information.

Another method system and machine readable medium of one embodiment maintains network security by distributing network security platforms to each of plural networks having a sensor execution environment and analysis execution environment. Network activity is monitored at each network with sensor modules running on the sensor execution environment to store monitored network activity in memory accessible by the analysis execution environment. Network threats are detected with one or more analysis modules running on an analysis execution environment by analyzing stored network information and in response to detecting one or more of the analysis modules are distributed to plug into others of the plural network security platforms. For example analysis modules are distributed as pluggable modules that execute on the analysis execution environments of other network security platforms. In one embodiment analysis modules bind an executable to become part of a dataflow from a sensor table so that the analysis module activates as a sensor writes network telemetry information to the sensor table that is an input to the analysis module.

Another method system and machine readable medium of one embodiment manages network information such as network telemetry information stored in an active memory by storing the network information as objects accessing the objects with a security platform selectively converting less than all of the plural objects into a serialized form in the active memory and accessing at least some of the plural objects from the serialized form in the active memory with the network security platform. Objects in the active memory are incrementally partially serialized in plural partially serialized forms to reduce the amount of active memory used in storage of the objects. The partially serialized forms remain in active memory for rapid retrieval albeit somewhat slower retrieval than fully realized objects. A memory allocation module determines how to incrementally perform partial serialization based upon predetermined factors such as the complexity of an object the storage time of an object the frequency of retrieval of an object and other factors that weigh the cost in memory allocated to store the object versus the cost in increased retrieval time for the object.

Another method system and machine readable medium of one embodiment presents information for analysis at a display with visualization agnostic selection linked portlet trees. A portlet presents information as visual images at a display with a visualization component visualization settings and a filter. By interacting through the display with the root portlet a child portlet is presented having at least the parent filter and at least one unique factor relative to the root portlet such as a different visualization and or different filter. A tree of portlets from a root allows an end user to drill down into data with each child portlet having no greater amount of data than that presented by the parent.

Monitoring real time stateful network telemetry information in an active memory provides real time network threat neutralization unavailable from conventional network security systems that rely upon database analysis to find network security threats. An active memory used in embodiments of the present disclosure stores network telemetry information as the network telemetry information is provided from network sensors thus allowing a dataflow engine having plural pluggable network security modules to neutralize security threats as the security threats present in the active memory. The dataflow engine has defined memory and logic resource allocations for pluggable network security modules so that efficient use of memory and processing resources provide an accurate and timely response to network threats in rapidly deployable modules.

Pluggable modules provide investigative collaborative and threat neutralization functions based upon network telemetry information stored in an active memory. Sensor modules monitor network activity by interfacing with network sensors and storing monitored network activity in active memory accessible by analysis modules. Sensor modules selectively gather network telemetry information to allocated areas of active memory where network security modules analyze the network telemetry information and take action to neutralize detected network threats. Sensed network telemetry information includes large quantities of a wide variety of activity sensed by network resources. The sensed network telemetry information is arranged sorted and filtered with visualization agnostic selection linked portlets that rapidly present plural visualizations of rows columns graphs aggregations parallel coordinates or other desired views that isolate outlier activity typically associated with malicious attacks. The active memory provides analysis modules with live network telemetry information directly from collection by network resource sensors rather than stale information stored and then retrieved from a database. The active memory network information includes state information that is often lost with archived and retrieved information such as state information associated with protocols and connections so that pluggable analysis modules correlate virtually any number of incident parameters imaginable in real time. As a network security platform dataflow engine detects and reacts to threats pluggable network security modules used to detect and respond to threats are collaboratively shared with other network security platforms to respond to similar threats in other networks.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts network resources protected by network security platforms having a dataflow engine that uses pluggable network security modules interfaced with an active memory to identify and neutralize threats. The network resources monitored and or protected by network security platform include a wide variety of physical devices that communicate process store and use information such as servers that support clients local to an intranet clients remotely interfaced with intranet through Internet and mobile clients remotely interfaced through a mobile network . Some network resources are deployed within Internet to aid in communication of information such as routers and switches . Network resources include conventional network security devices such as firewalls that restrict access to servers or clients identification authenticators that restrict access to information based upon an end user identifier authorization and anti phishing and anti spam applications that filter out e mail messages having indications of a malicious source.

Dataflow engine executes over a network security platform under the management of a security client . For example network security platform is a server interfaced with intranet to communicate information with network resources using TCP IP and other protocols. Network security platform has one or more processors that execute instructions stored in non persistent memory such as dynamic random access memory and persistent memory such hard disk drives and solid state drives. Dataflow engine provides one or more execution environments that support execution of network security modules such as sensor modules that collect network telemetry information sensed at various network resources and store the network telemetry information in active memory and analysis modules that analyze network telemetry information stored in active memory . In one embodiment dataflow engine is a Python based object oriented environment that pushes native code of network security modules into an execution path of program memory for rapid access to network telemetry information as it arrives in active memory . In one embodiment active memory is dynamic random access memory DRAM directly accessible by the processor s running sensor modules and analysis modules . Active memory stores data memory of the dataflow engine execution environment without archiving sensed network telemetry information to a database format. Security client is for example a client computer interfaced with network security platform through a web browser that presents network telemetry information to an information technology specialist for detection and neutralization of network security threats. As network security threats are identified and neutralized by a network security platform pluggable modules for detecting and responding to the network security threats are stored in a pluggable module library for transfer and use at other network security platforms that face the same or similar threats.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts a network security platform having a processor and active memory to run network security modules for monitoring network resources and neutralizing network threats. Processor interfaces with a network interface to retrieve network telemetry information sensed at network resources and store the network telemetry information in active memory . For example network security modules in active memory include a sensor module that has native code executing in program memory of processor to retrieve sensor information from network resources and to store the sensor information in allocated portions of active memory as network telemetry information . A memory allocation module executing from program memory of processor associates each network security module with an allocated area of network telemetry information stored in active memory . As network telemetry information is stored in an area allocated to a network security module memory allocation module activates the associated network security module to process the information such as by activating native code of the associated network security module to process the network telemetry information . Thus as network telemetry information is updated functions associated with predetermined portions of the network telemetry information are activated performed and then returned to an inactive state for real time responses. For example memory allocation module uses a publish and subscribe method to link network security module outputs to the inputs of other network security modules. Memory allocation module manages active memory to maintain the most relevant network telemetry information in active memory without exceeding storage resources. For example active memory is DRAM that memory allocation module divides into allocated areas based upon memory allocations made for each network security module . As an allocated area becomes full memory allocation module discards older and or less relevant network telemetry information to a database for archiving. Memory allocation module tracks the usage of network telemetry information to re allocate storage resources so that more relevant information has a greater storage life within active memory .

Referring now to a block diagram depicts a network security module having an input specification logic specification and output specification . For example network security modules are objects defined to execute in a Python execution environment. In the example embodiment depicted by the security module d has an input specification defining information stored in active memory used as inputs for a network security function provided by logic specification . Logic specification performs functions on the inputs using predetermined allocations of memory m and processing resources p to generate an output defined by output specification . Output specification stores output in predetermined allocated areas of active memory that may in turn provide an input to another network security module . In one embodiment memory allocation module dynamically optimizes network security platform requirements by including in active memory only network telemetry sources of information required by the aggregation of all network security module input specifications . For example network telemetry information from sources that do not fall within the aggregate of input specifications for a network security platform are discarded from active memory to an archive of persistent memory such as a database. Network security modules are automatically linked together by the input and output specifications to create an efficient data flow dependence graph. In one embodiment network security platform processing and memory resources are optimized by only storing network telemetry information required by network security modules in use at the network security platform and by processing logic only when new input information associated with a security module in use arrives at network security platform . By optimizing the selection of information sources the memory requirements and the processing cycles of each dynamically linked network security module greater numbers of network security modules can run on a given set of memory and processor resources. Memory allocation module applies the input specification and the memory and processing allocations of the logic specification to allocate active memory in association with network security modules . Memory allocations are adapted by memory allocation module to store network telemetry information optimized in accordance with historically measured usage. Memory allocation module further optimizes memory utilization by assigning a time frame for maintaining network telemetry information in active memory so that information is removed from active memory as the information exceeds a predetermined aging period. In addition to aging memory pressure is considered. Memory aging primarily determines what information to remove while memory consumption primarily determines when to remove the information.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts dynamic linking between security modules by linking output to input specifications. Tables in active memory store outputs of security modules with a publish and subscribe method to link the output of selected modules to the input of selected modules. Linking security module outputs to inputs efficiently activates a downstream security module only when a relevant output of an upstream security module is presented as a new input. In this manner network security modules that perform analysis or threat neutralization functions remain inactive until a sensor module outputs a sensed network telemetry value that maps to an input of the analysis or neutralization module. The publish and subscribe method passes the output value of the sensor module to subscribed analysis and neutralization modules so that analysis and neutralization functions are activated only when relevant inputs are sensed by network security platform. In one alternative embodiment security modules are executed by multiple platforms or multiple CPUs that use a shared memory architecture to provide data access to each platform or CPU. Alternatively a non shared memory architecture may be used for some security modules such as based upon the platform or CPU that executes the security modules. For example in a non shared memory architecture messages communicate information between security modules such as with network messaging. As an example multiple platforms might each support one or more security modules with a shared memory on the platform while the security modules communicate between platforms using a non shared memory architecture such as network messaging.

In the example embodiment depicted by five network security modules have dynamically constructed links that selectively activate downstream network security modules d d and d when outputs are made by d and d. Network security modules d and d receive inputs from a subset of external input sources stored in allocated areas of active memory . Network security module d has an input from d and modules d and d have an input from module d. Generally network security platform is a system S of n security modules d through d n that optimizes data flow by selecting only the subset of all network telemetry information data sources needed for the system S to operate. In the example embodiment depicted by the optimized data flow is the intersection of the inputs of all externally facing inputs which equals the inputs i 1 to security module d plus the inputs i to security module d . Active memory need only store these optimized inputs to support a network security platform dataflow engine having network security modules d while the total memory allocated to the dataflow engine is the sum of the memory of each logic specification for each of the network security modules d . Each network security module can have very specific memory allocations so that new network security modules can be added to the dataflow engine incrementally without having to allocate large or arbitrary amounts of memory to the entire system. In an example optimized network security platform only data needed or used by one or more security modules are ever stored in active memory to optimize the use of memory and allow the network security platform to operate at high speed with direct access to information stored in DRAM instead of relying upon hard disk drive storage or archive database information. Further limiting data saved to only that called for by the sum of inputs of network security modules increases the number of network security modules that can run on a given allocation of memory. Processing efficiency is achieved since a network security module s logic processing is activated only when relevant input changes occur at active memory that are specific to a network security module so that minimal processing is performed based upon new data events.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts a method for performing a dataflow engine at a network security platform to maintain security of a network. At step network telemetry information is sensed by sensors associated with network resource devices such as servers firewalls authentication services routers etc. . . . At step the network telemetry information is communicated to an active memory of a network security platform. In one example embodiment sensor modules of the network security platform receive the network telemetry information and selectively store only the portions of the network telemetry information that fall within the sum of external inputs of network security modules running on the network security platform. As an example network telemetry information is selectively pushed from sensors to a predetermined active memory location with an agent associated with the sensor. As an alternative example network telemetry information is selectively pulled to an active memory location with an agent associated with the active memory platform such as an agent running on a server. At step the network telemetry information is stored in allocated areas of active memory by the sensor modules. At step a new data event for an allocated area of the active memory activates network security modules associated with the allocated area such as by a publish and subscribe method linking new data to network security module s that use the new data in their input specification. At step the activated network security modules perform analysis and threat neutralization functions on the sensed information by executing logic to use the inputs. At step the active memory is maintained within allocated restraints by selectively pruning information from allocated areas based on data aging data usage data size or other constraints.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts plural network security platforms deployed at plural networks each network security platform having pluggable network security modules . Pluggable network security modules offer rapid collaborative distribution of protective measures between plural networks when network threats are discovered at one network that have the potential to spread to other networks. Pluggable functionality is provided by making network security modules separately installable and distributable units of software from the base network security platform . Network security platform is built with plural execution environments adapted to execute pluggable network security modules such as object oriented Python execution environments. In the example embodiment depicted by a sensor execution environment runs pluggable sensor network security modules that perform data mining functions by collecting selected of sensed network telemetry information defined by input specifications of network security modules running on network security platform . In order to make more rapid data transfers serialized or partially serialized data having a reduced memory footprint as set forth below may be used to transfer network telemetry information instead of transferring a fully realized object form. In one example embodiment a fully realized object is translated to the compact or semi compact form of data in order to effectuate data transfers in a more rapid manner. Additionally an analysis execution environment runs pluggable analysis network security modules that have logic to perform network security functions with the network telemetry information. A dataflow engine is formed within a network security platform by relating one or more execution environments to each other. In one alternative embodiment a network security platform may support plural data flow engines each dataflow engine having plural dynamically linked pluggable modules . An application programming interface defines communications between the execution environment and pluggable modules so that pluggable modules adapt collaboratively to network security platforms as needed. For example the execution environment exposes a Python language interface so that pluggable network security modules interface to the execution environment by defined Python subclasses and calls into the execution environment via inherited methods. Although presents an example embodiment with sensor and analysis execution environments in alternative embodiments alternative execution environments and modules may be used such as a separate execution environment and modules for neutralizing network threats by locking down network resources. In one alternative embodiment pluggable modules also interface with execution environments with standard and portable JSON representations that define specifications for the pluggable modules and other components such as tables created or used by the modules.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts one example embodiment of a pluggable module builder for creating network security modules that will plug into a network security platform execution environment. Builder is an instance of a Python class that builds network security module objects with executable code by exposing building blocks to a network administrator for creating a network security module . For example fundamental objects exposed to a network security module author include rows tables and bindings that are collected with associated code in an identifiable unit of functionality as a network security module . The rows are structured records mapping names to values and conforming to a schema. The tables are a collection of rows indexed in user definable ways that share a schema. Tables are named objects in the network security platform. Bindings are definitions of handlers associated with tables for particular events a type of object that embodies a connection between an event on a table and an entry point into executable code. Defined events include rowcreate which is addition of a row to a table rowupdate which is updating of a row in a table and rowdelete which is removal of a row from a table. Network security modules built by builder have an application programming interface that interfaces the network security module with an execution environment. For example application programming interface sets commands to interact with an execution environment for installing an object to persistent memory starting native code of the object to program memory by pushing it into the execution path stopping from program memory and uninstalling the network security module at the execution environment.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts one embodiment of a pluggable analysis network security module executing at a processor . In operation as network telemetry information is retrieved from sensors by sensor modules sensor modules store the network telemetry information that are inputs of the sum of input specifications for the analysis modules in active memory so that analysis modules have relevant network telemetry information in real time. In one embodiment the only network telemetry information that is stored in active memory is the network telemetry information that falls within the sum of analysis module input specifications. Sensor modules store the relevant network telemetry information in the active memory to be accessible by the analysis execution environment . For example the sensor execution environment arranges for relevant network telemetry information from sensor modules to appear in a sensor table of the analysis execution environment so that analysis modules can bind to sensor table for rowcreate events and therefore be invoked when new network telemetry information arrives from a sensor. In one embodiment sensor modules are organized as Unix subprocesses that emit to stdout newline delimited JSON records with one line and hence one record per event detected by the sensor module. The subprocess protocol also includes stderr which send a plain text when the sensor has an error or a line comprised of a JSON structure. The non error JSON structure messages include a structured message which can include severity information a statistics message which monitors performance and event processing by a sensor or a status message which monitors the sensor has a whole and components of the sensor.

As an example an analysis module stored in active memory as a Python subclass module has native code pushed into the program memory of processor . When a sensor module stores new network telemetry information to sensor table with a rowcreate a binding of analysis module to the rowcreate invokes analysis module to retrieve the new network telemetry information and perform logic of the logic specification. As part of the logic analysis module can construct its own tables such as append only log tables or correlation tables that map keys to rows to represent an output of the analysis to which other analysis modules can bind for performing higher order analysis. Output can for example include a rowcreate rowupdate or rowdelete to a table in active memory having a publish and subscribe relationship to another analysis module . One example of related pluggable modules that detect analyze and neutralize network security threats is the comparing of authentication information with a network resource use to detect unauthorized network access attempts. A sensor module detects a VPN access by a user with authentication information and stores the event to active memory sensor table as an input to an analysis module that monitors VPN accesses. The VPN access analysis module binds to the sensor table rowcreate to retrieve the authentication information and performs logic to check for an unauthorized access attempt such as a retrieval of the most recent building magnetic card access by the end user. The VPN access analysis module generates an output by a rowupdate to a lockdown table in active memory if the VPN access attempt occurs from a remote location while the end user is in an enterprise building. A lockdown analysis module binds to the rowupdate to retrieve the end user s identifier and applies the end user s identifier to perform a rowdelete of the end user from a VPN access table effectively locking out the end user from VPN access. Thus monitoring analysis and neutralization is performed in real time from active memory with the same set of common information and without delay introduced by archiving and then analyzing the network telemetry information.

Referring now to a block diagram of one example embodiment of active memory is depicted as random access memory RAM that provides rapid access to network telemetry information objects . Generally RAM provides greater speed of access to stored information however RAM is more expensive than offline storage such as hard disk drives. In order to store large quantities of information with less expense information stored as objects in RAM is serialized to a disk representation for storage on a hard disk drive. The serialized information is restored to object form from the serialized hard disk drive storage when retrieved from the hard disk drive storage for use by processing objects however the transformation and movement of the information introduces delays in the processing. Maintaining all relevant network telemetry information in one contiguous active memory of RAM to which the processor s have direct access provides real time network monitoring analysis and threat response based upon the same common set of network telemetry information. Serializing network telemetry objects for storage in an off line memory separate from the active memory introduces delays in processing that make real time response to threats difficult where large quantities of network telemetry information are available.

Network security platform stores large numbers of objects such as AVLs or rows in active memory that is directly accessible to a processor supporting execution environments so that a rapid response is possible to changes in network telemetry information as the changes are sensed. In one embodiment active memory is entirely made up of DRAM that is interfaced with a processor to provide data memory for supporting processor operations. In alternative embodiments active memory may instead be a contiguous block of other types of memory that provide data memory directly interfaced with a processor. A large storage capacity for active memory provides depth of network telemetry information over time and minimizes access time for network security modules. Memory allocation module allocates various amounts of active memory to different network security modules based upon desired response priorities. Memory allocation module also provides a fast restart capability for network security platform by taking snapshots of the state of memory for use in a restart if needed. Memory allocation module also archives older objects to off line storage as needed to manage the availability of active memory for new network telemetry information.

In order to balance rapid response memory size and memory availability memory allocation module defines multi level representations of objects with different space and performance tradeoffs. The lower level slower representations minimize their impedance mismatch with the requirements of off line hard disk drive storage. In the example embodiment depicted by memory allocation module defines multi level representations by separating out the serialization process from the persistence process to achieve more efficient in memory representations at active memory with partial serialization performed over time followed at a later time by persistence to off line storage.

A fast representation of network telemetry information provides the most rapid access and the greatest memory cost. Fast representation stores network telemetry information with attribute values of fully realized Python objects. Essentially in fast representation memory overhead for rapid use of network telemetry information is maintained in fully realized object form such as header data used to support pointers that allow rapid retrieval. A semicompact representation maintains complex attribute values such as dictionary sets as fully realized Python objects while storing simpler objects in serialized form to reduce per object overhead such as for IP integer and time objects. A compact representation fully serializes one or more network telemetry information objects as a separate object with shared context used to interpret the serialized representation such as a string table for interned strings. A batched representation assembles together compacted objects and compresses the assembled compacted objects into a page. A persistent representation prepares the batched representation for persistent storage by keying compressed batched strings to page numbers. Memory allocation module performs transitions between the representations incrementally based upon the amount of active memory that is available the amount of information stored and the relative importance for each network telemetry information object of a rapid retrieval. To minimize the immediate cost of a snapshot objects are incrementally pushed down the hierarchy as a scheduled snapshot approaches so that fewer objects remain in fast or compact representations.

Memory allocation module selects a representation for an object based in part upon the increased time for retrieval of the object as partial serialization progresses. In the case of batched representation objects saved with a batched representation are essentially immutable so that the object has to be extracted in order to be modified which adds to retrieval time. Compact representations that include Python strings may also be immutable. Memory allocation module will default to a fast or semicompact representation so that most accesses and modifications will be done to mutable objects however immutable objects provide a representation that allows more efficient memory use while retaining relatively rapid retrieval of network telemetry information that is less frequently used relative to retrieval times of off line storage. Where a batched representation is stored to a memory mapped file writing of the batched file to disk is asynchronous so that objects in the batched representation may be preemptively stored to disk storage for archiving if extra processing cycles are available even while the batched representation remains available in active storage. Other factors considered in the selection of a representation for a particular object include the complexity of attribute values the frequency of access to the object the length of time of storage in active memory and the timing of snapshots for rapid system restarts. Generally memory allocation module balances system response time with memory cost by tending to keep more complex and frequently accessed objects as fully realized objects while partially serializing less complex and less frequently accessed objects although other types of priorities may be applied as desired.

Memory allocation module manages memory use in part by discarding network telemetry information from active memory in time to make sure that room exists for the storage of newly sensed network telemetry information. In one embodiment discarding information from active memory is performed on a page level by deleting the oldest page and removing or marking as deleted any objects that still point to the oldest page from the object index. In one embodiment the age for determining deletion is based upon modification time of the object and in another embodiment age is based upon access time to the object. Where modification time is used page numbers are assigned in sequential order and then the lowest numbered page is the oldest. Where access time is used each page stores its most recent access time and then pages are deleted explicitly in age order. In another alternative embodiment storage volumes are created and deleted just as needed to maintain storage space in the active memory. This provides a log structured storage that provides time travel by very quickly restoring the state of the network security platform to a pre existing state at a previous time point. Alternatively to preserve processing cycles rather than saving network telemetry information to an archive after it becomes outdated old data is simply deleted and an archive is created off line by a parallel storage system interfaced with network sensors.

Referring now to a block diagram depicts a system for presentation of network telemetry information with plural visualizations in selection linked portlet trees. Linked portlets provide a presentation of network telemetry information to describe parent and child relationships amongst an arbitrary number of portlet visualizations each with its own visualization settings. An end user viewing linked portlets can quickly switch visualizations of selected network telemetry information to analyze network activity in real time as network resource sensors update network telemetry information in active memory. Each root portlet constrains information presented in its child portlets via a selection mechanism to provide a drilldown analysis system in which each child portlet displays a smaller data set or different visualization than its parent. Portlets provide a tool for visualizing relationships across different values from different portions of data such as separate data sources. As an example defining labels and operators for a portlet creates virtual columns of data with features that dynamically modify data models to graph visualizations and the results of analytics. An example of a relationship discoverable from network telemetry data presented in portlets is the impact of a virus on network assets. For instance a machine virus alert sets off an analysis of operating conditions at the machine to show an increase in machine CPU cycles around the time of the virus infection. By applying a visualization of machine operating conditions and virus alerts to detect the impact of a virus the label and operators for the visualization may be captured and applied to other network telemetry data to identify virus infections where an alert did not issue.

Portlets and are each a display element that includes a reference to a data source such as network telemetry information a filter set and a visualization . Portlet module responds to a request for a root portlet presentation by obtaining from an end user the desired filter set and visualization and retrieving the visualization method for visualization from visualization module . Portlet module generates a root portlet by mediating between the data source filter set and visualization to display information at a display with visualization settings applied to the method of visualization . Once a root portlet is presented at display an end user can modify its filter and visualization to adjust the presentation or can generate one or more linked child portlets with modifications to the filter and visualization relative to root portlet . Although referred to as a root portlet generated by application of a parent filter to root information the root is also considered a parent portlet with a parent filter applied to parent information. Through the parent child and sibling relationships a parent relative to other children which is also a child or sibling may be dynamically defined as a root that begins a new tree for a desired visualization.

In one example embodiment portlet module is a pluggable module running on a network security platform that links via tables to pluggable modules and other portlet modules to present parent and child portlets and at a security client having a display . Visualization module has plural visualizations for selection by portlet module . Each visualization includes a method for displaying a data set based upon specified settings such as rows columns graphs aggregations parallel coordinates or other desired views that isolate outlier activity typically associated with malicious attacks against network security. For example a bar chart visualization presents a bar chart based upon visualization settings that specify the field by which to aggregate the data. As another example a data grid visualization presents data groups in an order of fields specified by a user in associated visualization settings. In one example embodiment network telemetry information provides a data source which declares a field set and provides a mechanism for converting related filter sets into related data sets. A filter set is a set of zero or more comparison operators relative to a particular field set which is applied to constrain the amount of data in data sets relating to the same field set. Data sets displayed by a portlet are a set of rows relative to a particular field set with each row providing a value known as field values for every field in the field set. Field sets are a set of one more fields each declaring a name such as a ranking and optionally including a type such as integer data.

Visualization module provides visualizations so that the architecture of selection linked portlets is independent of the specific visualization in use. Presenting a portlet with a visualization is performed with a visualization component by declaring settings relevant to the visualization and selectable by an end user by providing a method to generate a display presentation with the visualization settings and by defining a filter set to determine the information included in the portlet presentation. The portlet presentation includes an interaction with the end user to allow selection of data for presentation. In the case of a child portlet the end user selects a subset of the root data set found in the root portlet for presentation in the child portlet. In response to selection of the child portlet and subset of data a method of the child visualization retrieves a filter set that when applied to the root data set results in presentation of the subdata set desired by the end user in the child portlet . For example when an end user selects a child portlet initiator a selection filter set of the child portlet visualization is applied to the root data set to select the desired data subset for presentation in the child portlet initiated by child portlet initiator . In one example embodiment a bar chart visualization that aggregates data as bars applies a selection filter set at the selection of a bar to initiate a child portlet for including comparison operators that fill out all data not represented by the selected bar. A visualization selector at each portlet and exposes a mechanism for an end user to quickly select a different visualization for presenting information in the portlet such as by switching between a bar graph and a data value presentation. Settings for visualizations are persisted so that the settings are re applied if the user switches back to a previously selected visualization.

In order to perform analysis of network telemetry information an information technology specialist defines selection linked portlet trees that visualize network threats such as outlier activity at the network often associated with malicious attacks or unauthorized activity. A selection linked portlet tree is a set of one or more portlets arranged into a tree such that each portlet has zero or more children and each portlet except the root portlet has a parent. Root portlet represents the top of the tree and has no parent. A portlet s ancestors include the parents up the tree to the root portlet. A portlet s descendants include the children of the portlet to the end of the tree. An information technology specialist reviewing network telemetry information in active memory selects relevant portions of the network telemetry information to view by selecting a filter set and visualization. Network threats are isolated typically as outlier information by drilling down into a data set with children portlets in conjunction with the filter sets and selections filter sets of ancestors for the relevant data source. Each portlet displays a data set that is at most the same size as its parent s data set but typically smaller than the parent data set as a result of applying the parent s selection filter set in addition to the child s own inherent filter set.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicts a process for drilling down into network telemetry information to evaluate network threats by creating a portlet tree and defining relationships between portlets of the tree. The process starts at step by creating a root portlet with selection of a data source a visualization and visualization settings. As an example the data set might consist of sensor data for network resources of a storage facility such as authentication and access requests to data stored in a storage area network. In the example embodiment the root portlet presents a bar graph that aggregates objects in the network telemetry information that result from sensors associated with the storage area network. The root portlet includes one or more child portlet initiators to create child portlets. At step a child portlet is created from the root portlet to help identify potential threats. The child portlet varies presentation of information by further filtering the information with an additional filter set or presenting the information with a different visualization than the root portlet. In the example embodiment the storage area network information is further filtered to isolate failed authentication attempts or viewed with a line graph visualization of network addresses that make failed authentication attempts. At step visualizations at the parent or child portlets are switched to provide different views of the information that highlight potential network security threats. At step the filter set for presenting information in the root or child portlets is modified by editing the selected portlet s filter set. Editing a filter set refreshes the portlet s data set and therefore its visualization as well as the data set and visualizations of descendant portlets that have their filter sets reset to adapt to the parent s new filter set. At step data for a root or child portlet is selected to provide a different visualization. For instance one or more elements within a portlet s visualization is selected to isolate information of interest which refreshes the portlet s selection filter to update the data set presented by the portlet and any descendent portlets.

Referring now to an example of a portlet tree display is depicted. A portlet tree presents related portlets by breadth and depth such as in sibling or generational relationships with each other. In the example depicted by a root portlet presents a bar graph to visualize an aggregation of information such as network telemetry information and is the originating parent portlet for sibling and child portlets of the example embodiment. A child portlet initiator presented at root portlet accepts a child portlet initiation command to initiate a selected of three types of child portlets. Activation of an arm of child portlet initiator initiates a peer or sibling portlet having a shared filter with root portlet but a different visualization such as a line graph showing network connections depicted by the bar graph of root portlet . Sharing an identical parent filter with root portlet allows peer portlet to present different visualizations of the root data generated by the parent filter while maintaining presentation of the root portlet . The presentation of information in the root portlet and peer child portlet stays synchronized with each other and provides a tool for an end user to create multiple trees of children from the same parent filter that presents root portlet to investigate by drilling down into different portions of the root data through different peer child portlets . Activation of an opposing arm of child portlet initiator initiates a subordinate child portlet that inherits the filter from its root portlet and adds an additional filter set for reducing the information presented by root portlet . Subordinate portals allow an end user to drill down into specific portions of the root data and present the drilled down subordinate data with a visualization and settings more appropriate for a precise analysis. Activation of a leg of child portlet initiator initiates a subordinate select child portlet . Subordinate select portlet may also be presented by selecting a portion of root portlet for more pr cised viewing such as by selecting a bar of the bar graph. The subordinate select child portlet applies the parent filter and then applies a child filter that identifies data desired for presentation such as the data associated with the bar of a bar graph or all of the data except the data associated with the bar of the bar graph. In each child updates to data of the root results in synchronization of the data presented by the child.

In one embodiment portlets aid in visualization and analysis of telemetry information by relating portions of data that do not have a defined relationship. For example a portlet visualization of a portion of data based upon a filter having a label and operand is applied to other portions of data without similar data and operand relationships by translating the filter of the first portlet to the use as the filter of the second portlet. A filter translator provides a tool for creating deleting or modifying relationships of existing portlets to adapt a visualization of existing portlets to other data. An example of a filter translator is the translation of a filter for data kept by the hour to use with data kept by the minute. Other more complex filter translators apply a function as a filter translator that operates on data of one set to generate data comparable to that presented by the portlet visualization. In alternative embodiments various translation filters may be used so that visualizations of data tracked by different parameters provide a meaningful comparison thus allowing repetition of the use of portlet tools across different data.
