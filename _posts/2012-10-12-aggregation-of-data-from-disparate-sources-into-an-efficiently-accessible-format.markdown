title: Aggregation of data from disparate sources into an efficiently accessible format
abstract: Methods and apparatus are presented for aggregating data from disparate sources into an efficiently accessible format. For example, an aggregation tool may receive attribute-based data from one source and metrics-based data from another source. Given this data, the aggregation tool may store attribute data from the attribute-based data into a data object, where the data object includes multiple time slots corresponding to defined time ranges. The aggregation tool may then determine from the metrics-based data, respective metrics data for each of the multiple time slots of the data object, where each time slot is associated with the attribute data. The aggregation tool may store the respective metrics data into each of the multiple time slots of the data object. In this way, the data object may serve to efficiently provide an answer to a query requiring data from multiple data sources.

A wide variety of applications allow a user to query and display report data where the report data may be culled from multiple sometimes disparate data sources. For example if a user through the use of a report generation tool is interested in data such that the data is dependent upon both transactional and analytics data a query to produce the data may be exceedingly slow because the necessary data is spread across multiple data stores and because the data stores may include massive amounts of data. In such a circumstance if a user requests to see keywords for which more than 50 cents was bid on in the past week and further where those keywords received at least 1000 clicks the query necessary to satisfy such a request would be time and computationally intensive. However it is often the case where a user is interested in data for certain commonly requested time frames such as the previous week or the previous two weeks or the quarter to date among other frequently specified date ranges. A further impediment to quickly satisfying a query that depends on both transactional and analytics data is that the structure of the stored data has different characteristics.

In one embodiment an aggregation tool may receive attribute based data from one data source and may also receive metrics based data from another different data source where the metrics based data is organized according to time. Further the aggregation tool may store attribute data from the received attribute based data into a data object where the data object includes multiple time slots that may each have a defined time range. The aggregation tool may then determine from the received metrics based data respective metrics data for each of the multiple time slots of the data object where each time slot of the multiple time slots is associated with the attribute data. The aggregation tool may then store the respective metrics data into each of the plurality of time slots of the data object. In this way the data object may be used to satisfy a query more efficiently than a query that requires extracting data from multiple disparate sources.

Various embodiments are presented for an data aggregator that may aggregate data from multiple disparate sources into an efficiently accessible format and for an extraction transformation and loading component ETL component that may operate between at least two data stores and provide data for being aggregated.

For example in the area of Internet marketing transactional data generated through the use of search marketing tool may be stored in a transactional database. In some embodiments the ETL component may extract data from an operational log of the transactional database transform the extracted data and load the extracted data into another database for example a database onto which data is aggregated.

Often when data from multiple data sources is moved to or aggregated at a different data store from the multiple data sources the data formats at the different data stores may not be compatible. In such cases to move data from one source to another data may need to be transformed from one format to another. Further in cases where a user is not interested in the entire content of the source data a subset of data to be extracted may first need to be identified. Once the data has been identified and transformed the data may then be loaded into a target data store.

Analytics data collected from an analytics server may be stored in an analytics database. As noted above if a user through the use of a report generation tool for example is interested in data such that the data is dependent upon both transactional and analytics data a query to produce the data may be exceedingly slow because the necessary data is spread across multiple data stores and because the data stores may include massive amounts of data.

For example if a user requests to see keywords for which more than 50 cents was bid on in the past week and further where those keywords received at least 1000 clicks the query necessary to satisfy such a request would be time and computationally intensive. However it is often the case where a user is interested in data for certain commonly requested time frames such as the previous week or the previous two weeks or the quarter to date among other frequently specified date ranges. This pattern of data request behavior is a basis for an data aggregator to collect prior to a request being made data that would satisfy a query within a data object.

For example metrics data stored within an analytics database is often associated with date ranges over which the metrics are collected such as a number of conversions or clicks or some other metric as measured over a day week month or some other period of time.

Further analytics data may be associated with for example a hit on a content site which may include the collection of multiple parameters such as a tracking code. In some embodiments the tracking code may be used to resolve the analytics data corresponding to the tracking code with transactional data within a transactional database.

On the other hand transactional data such as the kind generated when Internet marketing such as search marketing is performed has a current state that the user may be interested in. Further transactional data includes attributes. For example for an ad or keyword attributes may be how much a bid was with a certain search engine how much a bid was for a different search engine or a marketing campaign with which the ad or keyword is associated.

In some embodiments an data aggregator may receive attribute based data from a transactional database and metrics based data from an analytics database. To aggregate the data into a common data object the data object is structured based on the above described characteristics of the component data and based on the above described patterns of data access behavior such as commonly requested time periods for analytics data. Specifically in some embodiments the data object may store attribute data and corresponding analytics data such that the analytics data selected to be stored within the data object is based on one or more date ranges.

In other words the data aggregator may store attribute data from the attribute based data into a data object where the data object includes multiple time slots corresponding to defined time ranges. The data aggregator may then determine from the metrics based data respective metrics data for each of the multiple time slots of the data object where each time slot is associated with the attribute data. The data aggregator may store the respective metrics data into each of the multiple time slots of the data object. In this way the data object may serve to efficiently provide an answer to a query requiring data from multiple data sources.

In some embodiments the data object created by the data aggregator may be structured without schemas or tables thus providing flexibility in how data from the multiple sources is organized within the data object. For example the data object may be indexed according to an attribute of the attributed based data where the data aggregator may create a hierarchical structure to the data object through the nesting of different time slots or buckets within which metrics data corresponding to the time slot is stored. The lack of any schemas allows the data aggregator the flexibility to define a data object according to such a hierarchically nested structure as required and supporting ad hoc buckets in some embodiments.

More generally in some embodiments the data aggregator may create data objects within a database that does not adhere to the relational database management system model. In other words where data is not stored primarily within tables and where a standard query language SQL would not apply and JOIN operations would not be usable. In using key value indexing data retrieval of large quantities of data that do not require a relational model may be highly optimized. Given this flexibility the data aggregator may structure data objects to quickly satisfy queries that correspond to the structure of the data objects.

In some embodiments the data aggregator may receive data for aggregating from another type of data source and the schedule on which accesses are based may depend on the type or format or source of the data. In the case of analytics data the data aggregator may access or receive daily updates of analytics data from an analytics database or analytics server.

In addition to storing raw analytics data the data aggregator may also store calculated analytics data values. For example in the case the time slot is the past week analytics data for clicks for each of the past seven days may be stored in addition to a field corresponding to a calculation based on the raw analytics data for example average clicks for the week. For the calculated values the metrics data for the oldest day being replaced may be used to adjust the calculation one way and the metrics data for the newest day may be used to adjust the calculation the other way. For example if the calculated value of a metric is total clicks the clicks for the oldest day may be subtracted and the clicks for the newest day may be added resulting in an updated calculated total number of clicks for the past week.

In the case of analytics data a daily accesses of analytics data are preferred by many users because real time analytics data may not be as complete reliable or useful as the analytics data for the previous entire day.

In some embodiments when a date range for a given time slot of a data object is updated with new analytics data for the previous day the metrics data for the oldest day of the time slot may be subject to being decremented by the metrics values of that oldest day and then incremented with the metrics values for the previous day.

In some embodiments in the case of transactional data the data aggregator may receive real time near real time or runtime updates from the ETL component. In some cases a transactional database may update an operational log as the database receives and stores data within the transactional database. In this example an ETL component may access the operational log to detect an update to the operational log. The ETL component may also in response to detecting the update to the operational log of the transactional database extract a subset of data from the operational log where the extraction of the subset of data is based one or more rules.

In some embodiments updates to the operational log are deltas from previous updates. However in the case of aggregating data into a data object and storing attribute based data within the data object the data object may be updated based on a delta value. In this case it is sufficient that the data extracted is simply a delta value from a previous update. For example say a campaign account within a transactional database has x campaigns and a data object which includes attribute data for the campaign account stores the number of campaigns x. In this case a rule may be that whenever a campaign is added or deleted the number of campaigns is to be correspondingly modified. In this way a modified count of campaigns serves as the update to the data object when the ETL component loads data into the Aggregation Data store .

In cases where the transaction database is an RDBMS the ETL component extraction does not access any database tables from the transaction database. In some cases the format of the accessed data needs to be modified to be compatible with the format of the aggregation database and in such cases the ETL component may transform the extracted subset of data from the operational log into a data format for another database. In some cases the data format of the transaction database may be the same from the data format for the aggregation database. Once the ETL component has extracted the subset of data the ETL component may load the subset of transformed data into the data format for the aggregation database.

In some embodiments the functionality of the ETL component may be incorporated into the functionality of the data aggregator where the data aggregator may execute on the aggregation database and remotely access the operational log. In some embodiments when the functionality of the ETL component is incorporated into the data aggregator the data aggregator may communicate with a process such as a listening process executing on the transactional database.

In some embodiments the aggregation of data depends on the characteristics of the data being aggregated. Further in different embodiments different types of data objects corresponding to or storing the aggregated data may be defined. For example a data object may be defined such that the data object is indexed or located through an attribute key where the attribute key may be a transactional data element as depicted in . In this example the data object may have a configurable number of date range slots where different ranges may be made available to different users. In some cases a user may specify an ad hoc or custom date range after the data object has been created and populated with data. In such a case if a data object has been defined with a fixed number of time slots a time slot dedicated to ad hoc date ranges may be used for the custom date range. In other cases where a data object may hold any number of time slots limited only by available memory the data object may be updated to specify an additional time slot in accord with the custom date range specified.

In each of the various embodiments of a data object the date range slots may be defined to hold data corresponding to any selection of times including non contiguous date ranges. In other embodiments the data aggregator may aggregate the data into any type of data structure that may be indexed according to a key value and where the data structure may store one or more nested ranges of values.

In some embodiments the data aggregator may identify a data object according to multiple indexes. For example transactional data may include attributes for a keyword an ad a group that includes certain keywords or ads or campaigns. Correspondingly the analytics data may be rolled up according to each of these transactional attributes across a given time range and stored within the data object.

As noted above one reason to organize analytics data according to date ranges is because that is how analytics data is usually queried when generating metrics reports. However in some cases where data from another type of data store is organized differently the data aggregator may correspondingly define slots within which to store the other type of data in accord with how the other type of data is organized.

In some embodiments in generating a report using the data the parameters of the query or the parameters of the most common types of queries to the database holding the data may be used in defining the scope of one or more of the slots of the aggregated data object.

In some embodiments the type of data stored within the segments buckets or slots of the data object may be used to define segments buckets or slots representative of delta values between other segments buckets or slots. For example a data object may have three slots one for the past week one for the week before the past week and a delta between the two weeks of the first two slots. In this example say the analytics data includes numbers of clicks on an ad where the number of clicks in the past week is 10 000 and the number of clicks on the add for the week before the past week is 15 000. In this case the delta slot may hold the value of 10 000 15 000 or 5 000 indicating a drop off of 5 000 clicks on the add from the previous week to the current week. In some cases the delta may be measured as a percentage or according to some other measure. Using delta slots allows for queries such as a request for keywords with over 1 000 clicks in the last week but that has a negative delta from the week before that. In other cases a dedicated slot may be more complicated than a delta and may correspond to any given formula or calculation.

In some embodiments a dedicated delta slot is not necessary to answer such a query and the data aggregator may calculate the necessary value when the query is received. However in the case where the slot holds the answer the data aggregator avoids having to perform a calculation in generating a response to the query. Further delta slots or formula slots occupy very little memory space and because queries often include parameters specifying trending information delta or formula slots may allow for great speed optimization.

In some embodiments the data aggregator may not have a slot or range of data that corresponds to data to satisfy a query. However it may be the case that the data aggregator may use existing data stored within a data object to satisfy the query. For example say a data object has a slot for storing analytics data for a keyword for the most recent week and another slot for storing analytics data for the keyword for the week before the most recent week. In this example say the user submits a query where analytics data for the previous two weeks is necessary to satisfy the query. In this case while there may be no pre defined slot that matches the date range of the previous two weeks all of the analytics data necessary to satisfy the query is stored within the data object. In this case the data aggregator may use the analytics data within the slot for the previous week in addition to the time slot for the week before the previous week.

In some embodiments the data aggregator may also use a subset of analytics data that may be determined across multiple slots of the data object. For example if the query specified a date range of the past 9 days the data aggregator may use the analytics data stored within the slots for the previous week and the analytics data for the slot for the week prior to the previous week. Once the data aggregator has extracted the data from the appropriate slots the data aggregator may generate a response to the query.

However it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances methods apparatus or systems are not described in detail below because they are known by one of ordinary skill in the art in order not to obscure claimed subject matter.

It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals as bits data values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. It should be understood however that all of these or similar terms are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout this specification discussions utilizing terms such as processing computing calculating determining or the like refer to actions or processes of a specific apparatus such as a special purpose computer or a similar special purpose electronic computing device.

For example in the case of aggregating attribute based transaction data and metrics based analytics data the data aggregator may receive data from one or more databases storing the attribute based data and one or more databases storing the metrics based data. In other embodiments the data aggregator may aggregate more than two types of data.

In this example and as depicted according to system one data source is attribute based data stored within Transactional Data store of and another data source is metrics based data stored within Analytics Data store . In some embodiments the Analytics Data store may be updated by Analytics Server either directly or over a network such as network as depicted within .

As depicted in both Transactional Data store and Analytics Data store are coupled to Aggregated Data store which is where the data aggregator creates and stores the data objects including the aggregated data.

As reflected in stage the aggregation of data includes receiving attribute based data from one data source and as reflected in stage metrics based data is received from another data source where the metrics based data is organized according to time.

Upon receiving the data to be stored within a data object the data aggregator may then store attribute data from the received attribute based data into the data object where the data object includes multiple time slots and where each of the multiple time slots is defined according to a time range as reflected in stage . In some cases the time range may not be a contiguous span but rather a collection of one or more time periods such as the previous four weekends or the weekdays of the last month.

In storing the metrics based data the data aggregator may determine from the received metrics based data respective metrics data for each of the multiple time slots of the data object where each time slot is associated with the attribute data as reflected in stage

Once the determination of respective metrics data has been made the data aggregator may store the respective metrics data into each of the multiple time slots of the data object as reflected in stage . In this way a single data object may be either created initially or updated with new data.

Further the data aggregator may repeat this process of creating or updating data objects for any number of data objects where the creation or update of subsequent data objects includes the processing stages of through

In some embodiments a data object may be structured according to the elements of Data Object in . In this example the respective metrics data may be stored within the multiple time slots depicted as Metrics Data Date Range Metrics Data Date Range Metrics Data Date Range among other possible time slots. Further in this example the attribute data from the received attribute based data may be Attribute Data of Data Object .

As noted above the structure of a data object may take may forms and may be implemented in a variety of data structures. As one example depicts a data object which in some cases may be stored in a document within a file system. As depicted by surrounding box the data object may include multiple identification values that are references to say a keyword. These identification values in additional to attribute data are at the same hierarchical level as indicated in this example with nesting within a curly bracket.

The data object may further include attribute data such as firstPageCPC which refers to cost per click for a first page of say a website home page and maxCPC or maximum cost per click. In this example the values for each of the attributes is next to the attribute separated with a colon where attributes are separated with commas. However the syntax is unrelated to the functionality or the nested structure of the data object.

Further in this example metricSlot1 and metricSlot2 represent time slots or bins or buckets into which a slice of analytics data may be stored where the slice corresponds to a particular date range. The analytics data within a given time slot may be raw analytics data such as revenue which in this example corresponds to a value of 3.50. The analytics data within a given time slot may also be a calculation based on the analytics data such as calculated metric . As discussed above the calculation may be any formula or calculation applied to analytics data within the particular time slot.

As discussed above when a data object exists that holds data sufficient to satisfy a query a query response may be generated quickly in most cases under a second. For example a user may select through a user interface such as User Interface within parameters for a query beginning with a selection of a Reports drop down menu.

In this example the user may specify attribute parameters within text box and the user may also specify a date range that has been determined prior to the user beginning the construction of the query. Specifically in this example the user may select Quarter to Date as the date range for the query where the selection is indicated with a shaded box and an arrow.

As discussed above the data aggregator may operate to aggregate data from more than two data sources. In such cases the drop down menu may be defined to include multiple selectable pre defined parameters that may correspond to pre defined slots within a data object where the variable parameter value may serve as the index to identify the data object and where the selectable parameters correspond to fixed parameters according to which the slots within the data object may have been defined and populated with data from the multiple sources of data. In such cases the nesting depicted within may extend to additional levels corresponding to the types of data from each of the multiple data sources.

In this example where a user selected a pre defined date range corresponds to the examples above in regard to where the aggregation of data depicted in stages and may begin once the date ranges seen in the drop down menu are defined.

However it may be the case that time slots used to create the data object do not satisfy a user query and in such a case the data aggregator may create a new slot to store the data to satisfy the query. In this case a user may either first create a new custom date range after which the user may then enter a query specifying the new custom date range or a user may specify a custom date range at the time the query parameters are specified. In either case there may be an initial delay while data corresponding to the date range is extracted and stored in the appropriate data object before a query using the new date range may be satisfied.

When specifying a custom date range a user may use a date range specification option presented in drop down menu where a user may select either Custom or Calendar in order to define a custom or ad hoc date range. In the case where a user specifies a custom date range prior to a query once the date range has been specified and the data object updated the date range may appear within drop down menu as an option for a query.

Further in this example while the initial query may be delayed because the data aggregator needs to query the source database or databases subsequent queries using the same parameters may be answered quickly. As depicted by date range of a custom date range of the last 17 days may be available to a user once the data aggregator has created the custom time slot within the date object and stored the respective analytics data within the custom time slot.

In this example as in the discussion above in regard to an Aggregated Data store may be coupled to both a Transactional Data store and an Analytics Data store . Further as depicted in an Ad Hoc Aggregator may be a component within data aggregator and as depicted by Ad Hoc Aggregator Module within . In some embodiments the data aggregator including the ad hoc aggregator may be implemented within a system incorporating Aggregated Data store .

As reflected in stage an data aggregator receives a query where the query includes parameters for attribute data and parameters for a date range for metrics data. In this example the data object corresponding to the attribute data already exists.

The data aggregator may then identify the existing data object based on the attribute date from the query as reflected in stage . In this example the date range parameter of the query does not correspond to an existing time slot within the data object as determined at stage . Therefore in this example processing continues at stage where the data aggregator queries the data source storing the metrics data corresponding to the date range in the received query parameters.

Upon receiving a response to the query from the data source storing the metrics data the data aggregator may define a custom date slot within the data object as reflected in stage .

In some embodiments a data object used in the creation of ad hoc time slots may be structured according to the elements of Data Object in . For example at stage the data aggregator may create Ad Hoc Analytics Data Bucket within Data Object as depicted in . Ad Hoc Analytics Data Bucket may be created in response to a subsequent query using a time range parameter that does not correspond to an existing time slot within the data object. In some example there may be a fixed number of time slots reserved for ad hoc or custom date ranges for analytics data and in such a case the data aggregator may recycle time slots according to any number of different methods. For example given three ad hoc time slots where each is being used the data aggregator may recycle the time slot that has been least frequently used or least recently used or the data aggregator may apply a round robin approach or some other approach.

Given the new custom date slot the data aggregator may store the metrics data received from the data source for metrics data within the custom time slot of the data object as reflected in stage .

Once the metrics data required to satisfy the initial query is stored within the data object processing may continue at stage which is where processing continues when at stage the data aggregator determines that the data object includes a time slot for the date range of the initial query. At stage the data aggregator may use the data object to build a query response based on the attribute data and on the metrics data within the time slot corresponding to the date range.

In some embodiments transactional data may be provided based on interactions with one or more search engines for example Search Engines and . In some embodiments transactional data may be provided from one or more of Search Engines and . In some embodiments User Interface or Search Marketing Tool may be implemented within either of Search Engines or

In other embodiments the source data may be distributed across multiple different databases where the ETL component would extract data from each of the distributed database sources of transactional data.

As described above the ETL component may operate independently or as part of an data aggregator. In a case where the ETL component may operate independently the ETL component such as ETL Component may operate within a system including Transactional Data store and the ETL component may communicate over a network as depicted within or over a communication link with the database which is to be provided with the extracted data as depicted within .

In this example the ETL component may access operational log of Transactional Data store to detect an update to the database as reflected in stage . Transactional databases in this example may be relational databases with data stored within tables and organized by schemas or the transactional database may be a schema less database. In either case the ETL component detects updates to an operational log which is independent of updates in the database to the tables or structures into which data is written. In other words access of the operational log does not include accessing tables or data structures within the database. In some embodiments avoiding the use indexes to access data stored within the database allows for improved performance of the ETL component.

In some embodiments detection of an update to an operational log may be performed in different manners. For example the ETL component may periodically or aperiodically poll the operational log to determine if any updates have occurred since the previous polling. In other cases the ETL may communicate or implement a listening process that is triggered when the operational log is modified or updated.

In either case once the ETL component has detected an update to the operational log of the database the ETL component extracts a subset of data from the operational log where the extraction of the subset of data is based on one or more rules as reflected in stage . As noted above the one or more rules may be user configurable and the rules may be defined to identify and extract specific types of data or updates to particular attributes of the transactional data. In some cases User Interface may provide an interface through with a user may define or configure rules that may be accessed by the ETL component. In general the rule may be any simple or complex set of instructions and or logic that serves to specifically identify the updates or modifications of interest to a user. Further the one or more rules may be designed to identify attribute based data in accord with attribute data used for indexing into a data object storing an aggregation of data from multiple disparate sources. In other words the rules may be configured to be based on the structure of a data object on Aggregation Data store such that the rules identify data that is to be stored within the data object.

As reflected in stage the ETL component may transform the extracted subset of data from the operational log into a data format for another database where the data format for the other database is different from a data format for the database of the operational log. In this example the other database the target database is the Aggregated Data store . Further in this example the ETL component may transform the subset of extracted data into a format suitable for creation of the data objects discussed above.

Once the extracted subset of data has been transformed the ETL component may load the subset of data into the other database in this case the Aggregated Data store where the subset of data has already been transformed into the data format for the Aggregated Data store . This loading process is reflected in stage .

Further because the ETL component may detect an update to an operational log as soon as the operational log is updated the ETL may accomplish the entire extraction transformation and loading elements in real time or at least near real time. Further still because the ETL component does not access the tables or data structures into which database updates are written and stored the ETL component does not compete with other processes that may be accessing the database and the ETL component does not compete with subsequent updates to the database.

In some embodiments Control Module may receive Input which may be various types of queries or data from other data stores. Depending on the input Control Module may create a data object update a data object or query a data object.

In some embodiments when the Aggregator Module is creating a new ad hoc date range within a data object the Aggregator Module may query an analytics data store to retrieve the metrics data that is to be stored within the new date range slot of the data object. In such a case Analytics Data Interface Module may query an analytics data store to retrieve analytics data for storing within the new date range slot and the retrieved analytics data may be Input .

In this example Control Module may invoke Ad Hoc Aggregator Module to create a new slot within the data object or to redefine an existing slot dedicated to ad hoc slots within the data object.

In some embodiments Transactional Data Interface Module may interface with or communicate with a transactional data store or any other type of data store to receive transactional data or the type of data corresponding to the any other type of data store. For example Transactional Data Interface Module may communicate with ETL component within Transactional Data store .

Given data from the multiple sources coupled to the Data Aggregator Module Aggregation Module may either create or update a data object with an aggregation of the data from the multiple sources of data as discussed in the various embodiments above.

In some embodiment Data aggregator Module may include each of the elements of ETL component Module and may correspondingly implement the features and functionality of the various ETL component embodiments discussed herein.

In some embodiments Control Module may receive Input which may be a notification that an operational log has been updated or the updated data added to the operational log. Depending on the input Control Module may use received update data or access the operational log to read the updated data.

In some embodiments Update Detection Module may actively determine when an update to the operational log has occurred. For example through the implementation of a listening process that detects when the operational log is updated or that may be notified when an update to the operational log is performed.

Given update data Extraction Module may apply one or more rules to determine the content of the extraction based on the rules and on the updated data. The rules may be simple identifications of a particular attribute value update or the rules may determine how updated data is to be interpreted and processed.

The one or more rules may be managed according to Rule Management Module which may provide an interface through which a user may define rules for determining what is to be extracted from the updated operational log or in the case that the ETL component Module is coupled to multiple data stores from the updated operational logs.

Transformation Module may take the extracted subset of data from the operational log and transform the data format of the extracted subset of data into a data format for a target database. The transformation may be performed according to transformation rules specifying the target format for example a format suitable for data objects described above into which aggregated data is to be stored.

Loading Module may communicate with over a network or directly interface with a target data store into which the transformed data is to be loaded. In cases of direct communication with a target data store the Loading Module may communicate through an application programming interface for a process on the target database. In other cases a data packet transmitted over a network may be defined for storing the data to be loaded including information regarding the source and contents of the data and any other routing data or metadata for the data to be uploaded.

Output may be the data to be loaded or Output may be information regarding interactions with a user interface for managing rules.

In some embodiment an ETL component may reside within an analytics data database such as ETL Component within Analytics Data . In such a case the ETL component may use rules configured or defined to identify particular subsets of analytics data. While in some cases the ETL component within the analytics data store may access an operational log in other cases the ETL component may poll the analytics data store directly without using an operational log. Collection of analytics data may be performed in a variety of ways and the disclosed embodiments do not depend on any particular method for the collection of analytics data.

For example based on the extraction rules the ETL component may generate a query to extract corresponding data. In this example Analytics Data may be updated based on analytics data collected from Analytics Server and possibly from other analytics data servers. Further similar to the embodiments described above with regard to an ETL component for an analytics data store may communicate and extract data from multiple analytics data stores.

In some embodiments an ETL component may reside within a transactional database such as Transactional Data . In such a case as described above in regard to the ETL component may communicate with a data aggregator in order for the ETL component to deliver or load extracted and transformed data from Transactional Data into for example Aggregated Data .

In other embodiments an ETL component and a data aggregator may operate on systems that are directly coupled as depicted with the link . In such a configuration the ETL component and data aggregator may communicate over a defined application programming interface API . For example API within Data Aggregator may provide for calls to enable data uploads and to respond for a request for one or more rules. Similarly API within ETL component may provide for calls to enable the loading or modification of one or more extraction rules or the loading or updating of a transformation rule for example in response to a changed data object format used within Aggregated Data .

As discussed elsewhere transactional data may be generated based on user interactions with a search marketing tool such as Search Marketing Tool . As depicted within the search marketing tool may include Data Aggregator and User Interface .

In some embodiment search engines provide tools similar to the functionality of a search marketing tool such as for providing keyword bid management and keyword management. As depicted within Search Engine a search engine may include an interface such as User Interface described in various embodiments above. In other cases as depicted within Search Engine a search engine may simply incorporate the functionality of a data aggregator such as Data Aggregator . In such a case the search engine may provide a user with report building tools that may allow a user to generate reports based on aggregated data.
