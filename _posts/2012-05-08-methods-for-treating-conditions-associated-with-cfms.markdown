Many human and mouse tumor cell lines secrete the cytokine CSF 1 Colony Stimulating Factor 1 also known as Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor M CSF that in turn attracts promotes the survival and activates monocyte macrophage cells through the receptor c fms Feline McDonough Strain . Tumor associated macrophages TAMs also known as tumor infiltrating macrophages TIMs can be the major component of the tumor stroma comprising as much as 50 of the cell tumor mass. Kelly et al. 198857 174 177 Leek et al. 199456 423 435. In surveys of primary human tumors there is widespread evidence for CSF 1 mRNA expression. In addition many studies have demonstrated that elevated serum CSF 1 the number of TAMs or the presence of tissue CSF 1 and or c fms are associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients.

TAMs support tumor growth metastasis and survival by a variety of means including direct mitogenic activity on tumor cells through secretion of PDGF TGF and EGF and metastasis through production of ECM degrading enzymes reviewed in Leek and Harris 20027 177 189 and Lewis and Pollard 200666 605 612 . Another important means of tumor support by TAMs is the contribution to neo vascularization of tumors via production of various proangiogenic factors such as COX 2 VEGFs FGFs EGF nitric oxide angiopoietins and MMPs. Dranoff et al. 20044 11 22 MacMicking et al. 199715 323 350 Mantovani et al. 199213 265 270. In addition CSF 1 derived macrophages can be immunosuppressive via production of various factors such as prostaglandins indolamine 2 3 dioxigenase nitric oxide IL 10 and TGF . MacMicking et al. 199715 323 350 Bronte et al 200124 431 446.

CSF 1 is expressed both as a membrane bound and as a soluble cytokine Cerretti et al. 198825 761 770 Dobbin et al. 200521 2430 2437 Wong et al. 198736 4325 4329 and regulates the survival proliferation chemotaxis and activation of macrophages and their precursors Bourette et al. 200017 155 166 Cecchini et al. 1994120 1357 1372 Hamilton 199762 145 155 Hume 198569 485 494 Sasmono and Hume eds.

The cognate receptor which is the c fms proto oncogene also known as M CSFR CSF 1R or CD115 is a 165 kD glycoprotein with an associated tyrosine kinase activity and belongs to the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes PDGFR PDGFR VEGFR1 VEGFR2 VEGFR3 Flt3 and c kit. Blume Jensen and Hunter 2001411 355 365 Schlessinger and Ullrich 19929 383 391 Sherr et al. 1985 41 665 676 van der Geer et al. 199410 251 337. The oncogenic form of c fms v fms which is carried by the McDonough strain of feline sarcoma virus is mutated to confer constitutively activated protein kinase activity Sherr et al. 198541 665 676 Roussel and Sherr 2003 Cell Cycle 2 5 6 . Expression of c fms in normal cells is restricted to myelomonocytic cells including monocytes tissue macrophages Kupffer cells Langerhans cells microglial cells and osteoclasts hematopoietic precursors and trophoblasts. Arai et al. 1999190 1741 1754 Dai et al. 200299 111 120 Pixley and Stanley 200414 628 638. Expression of c fms has also been demonstrated in some tumor cells Kirma et al. 200767 1918 1926 . A variety of in vitro studies and analyses of mutant mice demonstrate that CSF 1 is a ligand for c fms see e.g. Bourette and Rohrschneider 200017 155 166 Wiktor Jedrzejczak et al. 199087 4828 4832 Yoshida et al. 1990345 442 444 van Wesenbeeck and van Hul 200515 133 162 . Binding of CSF 1 to c fms induces autophosphorylation of the receptor at particular sites that result in downstream activation of signaling pathways including PI3 K AKT and Ras Raf MEK MAPK and macrophage differentiation is mediated primarily through persistent MEK activity Gosse et al. 200517 1352 1362 . Very recent evidence indicates that interleukin 34 IL 34 is also a ligand for c fms Lin et al. 2008320 807 811 .

Antigen binding proteins that bind c fms including human c fms are described herein. The human c fms antigen binding proteins were found to inhibit interfere with or modulate at least one of the biological responses related to c fms and as such are useful for ameliorating the effects of c fms related diseases or disorders. Binding of certain antigen binding proteins to c fms can therefore have one or more of the following activities inhibiting interfering with or modulating c fms CSF 1 binding or signaling inhibiting c fms IL 34 binding or signaling reducing monocyte migration into tumors and or reducing the accumulation of tumor associated macrophages TAMs .

Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.

The term transformation refers to a change in a cell s genetic characteristics and a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA. For example a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from its native state by introducing new genetic material via transfection transduction or other techniques. Following transfection or transduction the transforming DNA may recombine with that of the cell by physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell or may be maintained transiently as an episomal element without being replicated or may replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is considered to have been stably transformed when the transforming DNA is replicated with the division of the cell.

The terms polypeptide or protein are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms also apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is an analog or mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers.

The term isolated protein referred means that a subject protein 1 is free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found 2 is essentially free of other proteins from the same source e.g. from the same species 3 is expressed by a cell from a different species 4 has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides lipids carbohydrates or other materials with which it is associated in nature 5 is operably associated by covalent or noncovalent interaction with a polypeptide with which it is not associated in nature or 6 does not occur in nature. Typically an isolated protein constitutes at least about 5 at least about 10 at least about 25 or at least about 50 of a given sample. Genomic DNA cDNA mRNA or other RNA of synthetic origin or any combination thereof may encode such an isolated protein. Preferably the isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic diagnostic prophylactic research or other use.

A variant of a polypeptide e.g. an antigen binding protein or an antibody comprises an amino acid sequence wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into deleted from and or substituted into the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants include fusion proteins.

A derivative of a polypeptide is a polypeptide e.g. an antigen binding protein or an antibody that has been chemically modified in some manner distinct from insertion deletion or substitution variants e.g. via conjugation to another chemical moiety.

The term naturally occurring as used throughout the specification in connection with biological materials such as polypeptides nucleic acids host cells and the like refers to materials which are found in nature.

An antigen binding protein as used herein means a protein that specifically binds a specified target antigen such as c fms or human c fms.

An antigen binding protein is said to specifically bind its target antigen when the dissociation constant K is 10M. The antibody specifically binds antigen with high affinity when the Kis 5 10M and with very high affinity when the Kis 5 10M. In one embodiment the antibody has a Kof 10M and an off rate of about 1 10 sec. In one embodiment the off rate is about 1 10 sec. In other embodiments the antibodies will bind to c fms or human c fms with a Kof between about 10M and 10M and in yet another embodiment it will bind with a K 2 10.

 Antigen binding region means a protein or a portion of a protein that specifically binds a specified antigen. For example that portion of an antigen binding protein that contains the amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antigen binding protein its specificity and affinity for the antigen is referred to as antigen binding region. An antigen binding region typically includes one or more complementary binding regions CDRs . Certain antigen binding regions also include one or more framework regions. A CDR is an amino acid sequence that contributes to antigen binding specificity and affinity. Framework regions can aid in maintaining the proper conformation of the CDRs to promote binding between the antigen binding region and an antigen.

In certain aspects recombinant antigen binding proteins that bind c fms protein or human c fms are provided. In this context a recombinant protein is a protein made using recombinant techniques i.e. through the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid as described herein. Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant proteins are well known in the art.

The term antibody refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype or a fragment thereof that can compete with the intact antibody for specific binding to the target antigen and includes for instance chimeric humanized fully human and bispecific antibodies. An antibody as such is a species of an antigen binding protein. An intact antibody generally will comprise at least two full length heavy chains and two full length light chains but in some instances may include fewer chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in camelids which may comprise only heavy chains. Antibodies may be derived solely from a single source or may be chimeric that is different portions of the antibody may be derived from two different antibodies as described further below. The antigen binding proteins antibodies or binding fragments may be produced in hybridomas by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Unless otherwise indicated the term antibody includes in addition to antibodies comprising two full length heavy chains and two full length light chains derivatives variants fragments and mutations thereof examples of which are described below.

The term light chain includes a full length light chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full length light chain includes a variable region domain V and a constant region domain C. The variable region domain of the light chain is at the amino terminus of the polypeptide. Light chains include kappa chains and lambda chains.

The term heavy chain includes a full length heavy chain and fragments thereof having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full length heavy chain includes a variable region domain V and three constant region domains C1 C2 and C3. The Vdomain is at the amino terminus of the polypeptide and the Cdomains are at the carboxyl terminus with the C3 being closest to the carboxy terminus of the polypeptide. Heavy chains may be of any isotype including IgG including IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4 subtypes IgA including IgA1 and IgA2 subtypes IgM and IgE.

The term immunologically functional fragment or simply fragment of an antibody or immunoglobulin chain heavy or light chain as used herein is an antigen binding protein comprising a portion regardless of how that portion is obtained or synthesized of an antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full length chain but which is capable of specifically binding to an antigen. Such fragments are biologically active in that they bind specifically to the target antigen and can compete with other antigen binding proteins including intact antibodies for specific binding to a given epitope. In one aspect such a fragment will retain at least one CDR present in the full length light or heavy chain and in some embodiments will comprise a single heavy chain and or light chain or portion thereof. These biologically active fragments may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or may be produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of antigen binding proteins including intact antibodies. Immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragments include but are not limited to Fab Fab F ab Fv domain antibodies and single chain antibodies and may be derived from any mammalian source including but not limited to human mouse rat camelid or rabbit. It is contemplated further that a functional portion of the antigen binding proteins disclosed herein for example one or more CDRs could be covalently bound to a second protein or to a small molecule to create a therapeutic agent directed to a particular target in the body possessing bifunctional therapeutic properties or having a prolonged serum half life.

An Fab fragment is comprised of one light chain and the C1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.

An Fc region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the C1 and C2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C3 domains.

An Fab fragment contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the Vdomain and the C1 domain and also the region between the C1 and C2 domains such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab fragments to form an F ab molecule.

An F ab fragment contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C1 and C2 domains such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F ab fragment thus is composed of two Fab fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.

The Fv region comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains but lacks the constant regions.

 Single chain antibodies are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain which forms an antigen binding region. Single chain antibodies are discussed in detail in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88 01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 and 5 260 203 the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.

A domain antibody is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances two or more Vregions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two Vregions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.

A bivalent antigen binding protein or bivalent antibody comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. Bivalent antigen binding proteins and bivalent antibodies may be bispecific see infra.

A multispecific antigen binding protein or multispecific antibody is one that targets more than one antigen or epitope.

A bispecific dual specific or bifunctional antigen binding protein or antibody is a hybrid antigen binding protein or antibody respectively having two different antigen binding sites. Bispecific antigen binding proteins and antibodies are a species of multispecific antigen binding protein or multispecific antibody and may be produced by a variety of methods including but not limited to fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments. See e.g. Songsivilai and Lachmann 199079 315 321 Kostelny et al. 1992148 1547 1553. The two binding sites of a bispecific antigen binding protein or antibody will bind to two different epitopes which may reside on the same or different protein targets.

The term neutralizing antigen binding protein or neutralizing antibody refers to an antigen binding protein or antibody respectively that binds to a ligand prevents binding of the ligand to its binding partner and interrupts the biological response that otherwise would result from the ligand binding to its binding partner. In assessing the binding and specificity of an antigen binding protein e.g. an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof an antibody or fragment will substantially inhibit binding of a ligand to its binding partner when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner bound to the ligand by at least about 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 85 90 95 97 99 or more as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay . In the case of a c fms antigen binding proteins such a neutralizing molecule will diminish the ability of c fms to bind CSF 1. In some embodiments the neutralizing antigen binding protein inhibits the ability of c fms to bind IL 34. In other embodiments the neutralizing antigen binding protein inhibits the ability of c fms to bind CSF 1 and IL 34.

The term compete when used in the context of antigen binding proteins e.g. neutralizing antigen binding proteins or neutralizing antibodies that compete for the same epitope means competition between antigen binding proteins is determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein e.g. antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof under test prevents or inhibits specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein e.g. a ligand or a reference antibody to a common antigen e.g. c fms or a fragment thereof . Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used for example solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay RIA solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay EIA sandwich competition assay see e.g. Stahli et al. 19839 242 253 solid phase direct biotin avidin EIA see e.g. Kirkland et al. 1986137 3614 3619 solid phase direct labeled assay solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay see e.g. Harlow and Lane 1988 Cold Spring Harbor Press solid phase direct label RIA using 1 125 label see e.g. Morel et al. 198825 7 15 solid phase direct biotin avidin EIA see e.g. Cheung et al. 1990176 546 552 and direct labeled RIA Moldenhauer et al. 199032 77 82 . Typically such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these an unlabelled test antigen binding protein and a labeled reference antigen binding protein. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test antigen binding protein. Usually the test antigen binding protein is present in excess. Antigen binding proteins identified by competition assay competing antigen binding proteins include antigen binding proteins binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen binding proteins and antigen binding proteins binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen binding protein for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein. Usually when a competing antigen binding protein is present in excess it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein to a common antigen by at least 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 or 75 . In some instance binding is inhibited by at least 80 85 90 95 or 97 or more.

The term antigen refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent such as an antigen binding protein including e.g. an antibody or immunological functional fragment thereof and additionally capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that antigen. An antigen may possess one or more epitopes that are capable of interacting with different antigen binding proteins e.g. antibodies.

The term epitope is the portion of a molecule that is bound by an antigen binding protein for example an antibody . The term includes any determinant capable of specifically binding to an antigen binding protein such as an antibody or to a T cell receptor. An epitope can be contiguous or non contiguous e.g. in a polypeptide amino acid residues that are not contiguous to one another in the polypeptide sequence but that within in context of the molecule are bound by the antigen binding protein . In certain embodiments epitopes may be mimetic in that they comprise a three dimensional structure that is similar to an epitope used to generate the antigen binding protein yet comprise none or only some of the amino acid residues found in that epitope used to generate the antigen binding protein. Most often epitopes reside on proteins but in some instances may reside on other kinds of molecules such as nucleic acids. Epitope determinants may include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids sugar side chains phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups and may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics and or specific charge characteristics. Generally antibodies specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and or macromolecules.

The term identity refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules as determined by aligning and comparing the sequences. Percent identity means the percent of identical residues between the amino acids or nucleotides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on the size of the smallest of the molecules being compared. For these calculations gaps in alignments if any must be addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program i.e. an algorithm . Methods that can be used to calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or polypeptides include those described in Lesk A. M. ed. 1988 New York Oxford University Press Biocomputing Informatics and Genome Projects Smith D. W. ed. 1993 New York Academic Press Computer Analysis of Sequence Data Part I Griffin A. M. and Griffin H. G. eds. 1994 New Jersey Humana Press von Heinje G. 1987 Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology New York Academic Press Sequence Analysis Primer Gribskov M. and Devereux J. eds. 1991 New York M. Stockton Press and Carillo et al. 198848 1073.

In calculating percent identity the sequences being compared are aligned in a way that gives the largest match between the sequences. The computer program used to determine percent identity is the GCG program package which includes GAP Devereux et al. 198412 387 Genetics Computer Group University of Wisconsin Madison Wis. . The computer algorithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucleotides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined. The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acid or nucleotide the matched span as determined by the algorithm . A gap opening penalty which is calculated as 3 the average diagonal wherein the average diagonal is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used the diagonal is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix and a gap extension penalty which is usually 1 10 times the gap opening penalty as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments a standard comparison matrix see Dayhoff et al. 19785 345 352 for the PAM 250 comparison matrix Henikoff et al. 199289 10915 10919 for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix is also used by the algorithm.

Recommended parameters for determining percent identity for polypeptides or nucleotide sequences using the GAP program are the following 

Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in matching of only a short region of the two sequences and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full length sequences. Accordingly the selected alignment method GAP program can be adjusted if so desired to result in an alignment that spans at least 50 contiguous amino acids of the target polypeptide.

As used herein substantially pure means that the described species of molecule is the predominant species present that is on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the same mixture. In certain embodiments a substantially pure molecule is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least 50 on a molar basis of all macromolecular species present. In other embodiments a substantially pure composition will comprise at least 80 85 90 95 or 99 of all macromolecular species present in the composition. In other embodiments the object species is purified to essential homogeneity wherein contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods and thus the composition consists of a single detectable macromolecular species.

The term treating refers to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury pathology or condition including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement remission diminishing of symptoms or making the injury pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline making the final point of degeneration less debilitating improving a patient s physical or mental well being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters including the results of a physical examination neuropsychiatric exams and or a psychiatric evaluation. For example certain methods presented herein successfully treat cancer by decreasing the incidence of cancer causing remission of cancer and or ameliorating a symptom associated with cancer or an inflammatory disease.

An effective amount is generally an amount sufficient to reduce the severity and or frequency of symptoms eliminate the symptoms and or underlying cause prevent the occurrence of symptoms and or their underlying cause and or improve or remediate the damage that results from or is associated with cancer. In some embodiments the effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to remedy a disease state e.g. cancer or symptoms particularly a state or symptoms associated with the disease state or otherwise prevent hinder retard or reverse the progression of the disease state or any other undesirable symptom associated with the disease in any way whatsoever. A prophylactically effective amount is an amount of a pharmaceutical composition that when administered to a subject will have the intended prophylactic effect e.g. preventing or delaying the onset or reoccurrence of cancer or reducing the likelihood of the onset or reoccurrence of cancer or cancer symptoms. The full therapeutic or prophylactic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations.

 Amino acid includes its normal meaning in the art. The twenty naturally occurring amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology A Synthesis 2nd Edition E. S. Golub and D. R. Green eds. Sinauer Associates Sunderland Mass. 1991 incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Stereoisomers e.g. D amino acids of the twenty conventional amino acids unnatural amino acids such as alpha alpha disubstituted amino acids N alkyl amino acids and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides and are included in the phrase amino acid. Examples of unconventional amino acids include 4 hydroxyproline gamma carboxyglutamate epsilon N N N trimethyllysine epsilon N acetyllysine O phosphoserine N acetylserine N formylmethionine 3 methylhistidine 5 hydroxylysine sigma N methylarginine and other similar amino acids and imino acids e.g. 4 hydroxyproline . In the polypeptide notation used herein the left hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right hand direction is the carboxyl terminal direction in accordance with standard usage and convention.

Antigen binding proteins that bind c fms protein including human c fms hc fms protein are provided herein. The antigen binding proteins provided are polypeptides into which one or more complementary determining regions CDRs as described herein are embedded and or joined. In some antigen binding proteins the CDRs are embedded into a framework region which orients the CDR s such that the proper antigen binding properties of the CDR s is achieved. In general antigen binding proteins that are provided can interfere with block reduce or modulate the interaction between CSF 1 and c fms.

Certain antigen binding proteins described herein are antibodies or are derived from antibodies. In certain embodiments the polypeptide structure of the antigen binding proteins is based on antibodies including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies minibodies domain antibodies synthetic antibodies sometimes referred to herein as antibody mimetics chimeric antibodies humanized antibodies human antibodies antibody fusions sometimes referred to herein as antibody conjugates and fragments thereof. The various structures are further described herein below.

The antigen binding proteins provided herein have been demonstrated to bind to the extracellular domain of c fms in particular human c fms. As described further in the examples below certain antigen binding proteins were tested and found to bind to epitopes different from those bound by a number of other anti c fms antibodies. The antigen binding proteins that are provided compete with CSF 1 and thereby prevent CSF 1 from binding to its receptor. In certain embodiments antigen binding proteins inhibit binding between IL 34 and c fms. In other embodiments the antigen binding proteins inhibit the ability of c fms to bind both CSF 1 and IL 34. As a consequence the antigen binding proteins provided herein are capable of inhibiting c fms activity. In particular antigen binding proteins binding to these epitopes can have one or more of the following activities inhibiting inter alia c fms autophosphorylation induction of c fms signal transduction pathways c fms induced cell growth monocyte chemotaxis accumulation of tumor associated macrophages in a tumor or in the stroma of a tumor production of tumor promoting factors and other physiological effects induced by c fms upon CSF 1 binding. The antigen binding proteins that are disclosed herein have a variety of utilities. Some of the antigen binding proteins for instance are useful in specific binding assays affinity purification of c fms in particular hc fms or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of c fms activity. Some of the antigen binding proteins are useful for inhibiting binding of CSF 1 to c fms or inhibiting autophosphorylation of c fms.

The antigen binding proteins can be used in a variety of treatment applications as explained herein. For example certain c fms antigen binding proteins are useful for treating conditions associated with c fms such as reducing monocyte chemotaxis in a patient inhibiting monocyte migration into tumors inhibiting accumulation of tumor associated macrophage in a tumor or inhibiting angiogenesis as is further described herein. In certain embodiments the antigen binding proteins inhibit the ability of TAMs to promote tumor growth progression and or metastasis. In addition in cases where the tumor cells themselves express and use c fms antibody binding to c fms could inhibit their growth survival. Other uses for the antigen binding proteins include for example diagnosis of c fms associated diseases or conditions and screening assays to determine the presence or absence of c fms. Some of the antigen binding proteins described herein are useful in treating consequences symptoms and or the pathology associated with c fms activity. These include but are not limited to various types of cancer and inflammatory disease and well as cancer cachexia. In some embodiments the antigen binding proteins can be used to treat various bone disorders.

Colony stimulating factor 1 CSF 1 promotes the survival proliferation and differentiation of mononuclear phagocyte lineages. CSF 1 exerts its activities by binding to the cell surface c fms receptor resulting in autophosphorylation by receptor c fms kinase and a subsequent cascade of intracellular signals.

The terms c fms c fms receptor human c fms and human c fms receptor refer to a cell surface receptor that binds to a ligand including but not limited to CSF 1 and as a result initiates a signal transduction pathway within the cell. In some embodiments the receptor can bind IL 34 or both CSF 1 and IL 34. The antigen binding proteins disclosed herein bind to c fms in particular human c fms. An exemplary extracellular domain of human c fms amino acid sequence is depicted in SEQ ID NO 1. As described below c fms proteins may also include fragments. As used herein the terms are used interchangeably to mean a receptor in particular a human receptor that binds specifically to CSF 1.

The term human c fms h cfms receptor as used herein also includes naturally occurring alleles including the mutations A245S V279M and H362R. The term c fms also includes post translational modifications of the c fms amino acid sequence. For example the extracellular domain ECD of human c fms residues 20 512 of the receptor has eleven possible N linked glycosylation sites in the sequence. Thus the antigen binding proteins may bind to or be generated from proteins glycosylated at one or more of the positions.

The c fms signal transduction pathway is up regulated in a number of human pathologies that involve chronic activation of tissue macrophage populations. Increases in CSF 1 production are also associated with the accumulation of tissue macrophages seen in various inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. In addition the growth of several tumor types is associated with overexpression of CSF 1 and c fms receptor in cancer cells and or tumor stroma.

A variety of selective binding agents useful for regulating the activity of c fms are provided. These agents include for instance antigen binding proteins that contain an antigen binding domain e.g. single chain antibodies domain antibodies immunoadhesions and polypeptides with an antigen binding region and specifically bind to a c fms polypeptide in particular human c fms. Some of the agents for example are useful in inhibiting the binding of CSF 1 to c fms and can thus be used to inhibit interfere with or modulate one or more activities associated with c fms signaling. In certain embodiments the antigen binding proteins can be used to inhibit binding between IL 34 and c fms. In some embodiments the antigen binding proteins interfere with the ability of c fms to bind both CSF 1 and IL 34.

In general the antigen binding proteins that are provided typically comprise one or more CDRs as described herein e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 . In some instances the antigen binding protein comprises a a polypeptide structure and b one or more CDRs that are inserted into and or joined to the polypeptide structure. The polypeptide structure can take a variety of different forms. For example it can be or comprise the framework of a naturally occurring antibody or fragment or variant thereof or may be completely synthetic in nature. Examples of various polypeptide structures are further described below.

In certain embodiments the polypeptide structure of the antigen binding proteins is an antibody or is derived from an antibody including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies bispecific antibodies minibodies domain antibodies synthetic antibodies sometimes referred to herein as antibody mimetics chimeric antibodies humanized antibodies antibody fusions sometimes referred to as antibody conjugates and portions or fragments of each respectively. In some instances the antigen binding protein is an immunological fragment of an antibody e.g. a Fab a Fab a F ab or a scFv . The various structures are further described and defined herein.

Certain of the antigen binding proteins as provided herein specifically bind to human c fms. In a specific embodiment the antigen binding protein specifically binds to human c fms protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 1.

In embodiments where the antigen binding protein is used for therapeutic applications an antigen binding protein can inhibit interfere with or modulate one or more biological activities of c fms. In this case an antigen binding protein binds specifically and or substantially inhibits binding of human c fms to CSF 1 when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of human c fms bound to CSF 1 or vice versa by at least about 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 85 90 95 97 99 or more for example by measuring binding in an in vitro competitive binding assay . C fins has many distinct biological effects which can be measured in many different assays in different cell types examples of such assays are provided herein.

Some of the antigen binding proteins that are provided have the structure typically associated with naturally occurring antibodies. The structural units of these antibodies typically comprise one or more tetramers each composed of two identical couplets of polypeptide chains though some species of mammals also produce antibodies having only a single heavy chain. In a typical antibody each pair or couplet includes one full length light chain in certain embodiments about 25 kDa and one full length heavy chain in certain embodiments about 50 70 kDa . Each individual immunoglobulin chain is composed of several immunoglobulin domains each consisting of roughly 90 to 110 amino acids and expressing a characteristic folding pattern. These domains are the basic units of which antibody polypeptides are composed. The amino terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable domain that is responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy terminal portion is more conserved evolutionarily than the other end of the chain and is referred to as the constant region or C region . Human light chains generally are classified as kappa and lambda light chains and each of these contains one variable domain and one constant domain. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu delta gamma alpha or epsilon chains and these define the antibody s isotype as IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE respectively. IgG has several subtypes including but not limited to IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. IgM subtypes include IgM and IgM2. IgA subtypes include IgA1 and IgA2. In humans the IgA and IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains the IgG and IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two light chains and the IgM isotype contains five heavy chains and five light chains. The heavy chain C region typically comprises one or more domains that may be responsible for effector function. The number of heavy chain constant region domains will depend on the isotype. IgG heavy chains for example each contain three C region domains known as C1 C2 and C3. The antibodies that are provided can have any of these isotypes and subtypes. In certain embodiments the c fms antibody is of the IgG1 IgG2 or IgG4 subtype.

In full length light and heavy chains the variable and constant regions are joined by a J region of about twelve or more amino acids with the heavy chain also including a D region of about ten more amino acids. See e.g. Fundamental Immunology 2nd ed. Ch. 7 Paul W. ed. 1989 New York Raven Press hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes . The variable regions of each light heavy chain pair typically form the antigen binding site.

One example of an IgG2 heavy constant domain of an exemplary c fms monoclonal antibody has the amino acid sequence 

One example of a kappa light Constant domain of an exemplary c fms monoclonal antibody has the amino acid sequence 

Variable regions of immunoglobulin chains generally exhibit the same overall structure comprising relatively conserved framework regions FR joined by three hypervariable regions more often called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two chains of each heavy chain light chain pair mentioned above typically are aligned by the framework regions to form a structure that binds specifically with a specific epitope on the target protein e.g. c fms . From N terminal to C terminal naturally occurring light and heavy chain variable regions both typically conform with the following order of these elements FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 and FR4. A numbering system has been devised for assigning numbers to amino acids that occupy positions in each of these domains. This numbering system is defined in Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 1987 and 1991 NIH Bethesda Md. or Chothia Lesk 1987196 901 917 Chothia et al. 1989342 878 883.

Each of these variable regions may be attached to the above heavy and light chain constant regions to form a complete antibody heavy and light chain respectively. Further each of the so generated heavy and light chain sequences may be combined to form a complete antibody structure. It should be understood that the heavy chain and light chain variable regions provided herein can also be attached to other constant domains having different sequences than the exemplary sequences listed above.

In some instances the antibodies comprise two different heavy chains and two different light chains listed in TABLE 1. In other instances the antibodies contain two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains.

Some antigen binding proteins that are provided comprise a heavy chain variable domain comprising a sequence of amino acids that differs from the sequence of a heavy chain variable domain selected from V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 V13 V14 V15 V16 V17 V18 V19 V20 V21 V22 V23 V24 V25 V26 V27 V28 V29 V30 V31 and V32 at only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 amino acid residues wherein each such sequence difference is independently either a deletion insertion or substitution of one amino acid with the deletions insertions and or substitutions resulting in no more than 15 amino acid changes relative to the foregoing variable domain sequences.

Still other antigen binding proteins e.g. antibodies or immunologically functional fragments include variant forms of a variant heavy chain and a variant light chain as just described.

The antigen binding proteins disclosed herein are polypeptides into which one or more CDRs are grafted inserted and or joined. An antigen binding protein can have 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 CDRs. An antigen binding protein thus can have for example one heavy chain CDR1 CDRH1 and or one heavy chain CDR2 CDRH2 and or one heavy chain CDR3 CDRH3 and or one light chain CDR1 CDRL1 and or one light chain CDR2 CDRL2 and or one light chain CDR3 CDRL3 . Some antigen binding proteins include both a CDRH3 and a CDRL3. Specific heavy and light chain CDRs are identified in TABLES 3A and 3B respectively.

Complementarity determining regions CDRs and framework regions FR of a given antibody may be identified using the system described by Kabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. US Dept. of Health and Human Services PHS NIH NIH Publication no. 91 3242 1991. Certain antibodies that are disclosed herein comprise one or more amino acid sequences that are identical or have substantial sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of one or more of the CDRs presented in TABLE 3A CDRHs and TABLE 3B CDRLs .

The structure and properties of CDRs within a naturally occurring antibody has been described supra. Briefly in a traditional antibody the CDRs are embedded within a framework in the heavy and light chain variable region where they constitute the regions responsible for antigen binding and recognition. A variable region comprises at least three heavy or light chain CDRs see supra Kabat et al. 1991 Public Health Service N.I.H. Bethesda Md. see also Chothia and Lesk 1987196 901 917 Chothia et al. 1989342 877 883 within a framework region designated framework regions 1 4 FR1 FR2 FR3 and FR4 by Kabat et al. 1991 supra see also Chothia and Lesk 1987 supra . The CDRs provided herein however may not only be used to define the antigen binding domain of a traditional antibody structure but may be embedded in a variety of other polypeptide structures as described herein.

In one aspect the CDRs provided are a a CDRH selected from the group consisting of i a CDRH1 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 136 147 ii a CDRH2 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 148 164 iii a CDRH3 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 165 190 and iv a CDRH of i ii and iii that contains one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or insertions of no more than five four three two or one amino acids B a CDRL selected from the group consisting of i a CDRL1 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 191 210 ii a CDRL2 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 211 224 iii a CDRL3 selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 225 246 and iv a CDRL of i ii and iii that contains one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or insertions of no more than five four three two or one amino acids amino acids.

In another aspect an antigen binding protein includes 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 variant forms of the CDRs listed in TABLES 3A and 3B each having at least 80 85 90 or 95 sequence identity to a CDR sequence listed in TABLES 3A and 3B. Some antigen binding proteins include 1 2 3 4 5 6 of the CDRs listed in TABLES 3A and 3B each differing by no more than 1 2 3 4 or 5 amino acids from the CDRs listed in these tables.

In yet another aspect the CDRs disclosed herein include consensus sequences derived from groups of related monoclonal antibodies. As described herein a consensus sequence refers to amino acid sequences having conserved amino acids common among a number of sequences and variable amino acids that vary within a given amino acid sequences. The CDR consensus sequences provided include CDRs corresponding to each of CDRH1 CDRH2 CDRH3 CDRL1 CDRL2 and CDRL3.

Consensus sequences were determined using standard phylogenic analyses of the CDRs corresponding to the Vand Vof anti c fms antibodies. The consensus sequences were determined by keeping the CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a Vor V. Briefly amino acid sequences corresponding to the entire variable domains of either Vor Vwere converted to FASTA formatting for ease in processing comparative alignments and inferring phylogenies. Next framework regions of these sequences were replaced with an artificial linker sequence GGGAAAGGGAAA SEQ ID NO 325 so that examination of the CDRs alone could be performed without introducing any amino acid position weighting bias due to coincident events e.g. such as unrelated antibodies that serendipitously share a common germline framework heritage while still keeping CDRs contiguous within the same sequence corresponding to a Vor V. Vor Vsequences of this format were then subjected to sequence similarity alignment interrogation using a program that employs a standard ClutalW like algorithm see Thompson et al. 199422 4673 4680 . A gap creation penalty of 8.0 was employed along with a gap extension penalty of 2.0. This program likewise generated phylograms phylogenic tree illustrations based on sequence similarity alignments using either UPGMA unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages or Neighbor Joining methods see Saitou and Nei 19874 406 425 to construct and illustrate similarity and distinction of sequence groups via branch length comparison and grouping. Both methods produced similar results but UPGMA derived trees were ultimately used as the method employs a simpler and more conservative set of assumptions. UPGMA derived trees are shown in where similar groups of sequences were defined as having fewer than 15 substitutions per 100 residues see legend in tree illustrations for scale amongst individual sequences within the group and were used to define consensus sequence collections.

The sequence information for specific antibodies prepared and identified as described in the Examples below are summarized in Table 4C. For ease of reference in some instances an abbreviated form of the reference number is used herein in which the last number of the reference is dropped. Thus for instance 1.109.1 is sometime simply referred to as 1.109 1.109.1 SM is referred to as 1.109 SM 1.2.1 is referred to as 1.2 1.2.1 SM is referred to as 1.2 SM 2.360.1 is referred to as 2.360 2.360.1 SM is referred to as 2.360 SM etc.

In one aspect the isolated antigen binding proteins provided herein can be a monoclonal antibody a polyclonal antibody a recombinant antibody a human antibody a humanized antibody a chimeric antibody a multispecific antibody or an antibody fragment thereof.

In another embodiment the antibody fragment of the isolated antigen binding proteins provided herein can be a Fab fragment a Fab fragment an F ab fragment an Fv fragment a diabody or a single chain antibody molecule.

In a further embodiment the isolated antigen binding protein provided herein is a human antibody and can be of the IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 type.

In another embodiment the antigen binding protein consists of a just a light or a heavy chain polypeptide as set forth in Tables 4A 4C. In some embodiments the antigen binding protein consists just of a variable light or variable heavy domain such as those listed in Tables 4A 4C. Such antigen binding proteins can be pegylated with one or more PEG molecules.

In yet another aspect the isolated antigen binding protein provided herein can be coupled to a labeling group and can compete for binding to the extracellular portion of human c fms with an antigen binding protein of one of the isolated antigen binding proteins provided herein. In one embodiment the isolated antigen binding protein provided herein can reduce monocyte chemotaxis inhibit monocyte migration into tumors or inhibit accumulation and function of tumor associated macrophage in a tumor when administered to a patient.

As will be appreciated by those in the art for any antigen binding protein with more than one CDR from the depicted sequences any combination of CDRs independently selected from the depicted sequences is useful. Thus antigen binding proteins with one two three four five or six of independently selected CDRs can be generated. However as will be appreciated by those in the art specific embodiments generally utilize combinations of CDRs that are non repetitive e.g. antigen binding proteins are generally not made with two CDRH2 regions etc.

When an antigen binding protein is said to bind an epitope within specified residues such as c fms or the extracellular domain of c fms for example what is meant is that the antigen binding protein specifically binds to a specified portion of c fms. In some embodiments the antigen binding protein specifically binds to a polypeptide consisting of the specified residues e.g. a specified segment of c fms . Such an antigen binding protein typically does not contact every residue within c fms or the extracellular domain of c fms. Nor does every single amino acid substitution or deletion within c fms or the extracellular domain of c fms necessarily significantly affect binding affinity.

Epitope specificity and the binding domain s of an antigen binding protein can be determined by a variety of methods. Some methods for example can use truncated portions of an antigen. Other methods utilize antigen mutated at one or more specific residues.

With respect to methods using truncated portions of an antigen in one exemplary approach a collection of overlapping peptides can be used. The overlapping peptides consist of about 15 amino acids spanning the sequence of the antigen and differing in increments of a small number of amino acids e.g. three amino acids . The peptides are immobilized within the wells of a microtiter dish or at different locations on a membrane. Immobilization can be effected by biotinylating one terminus of the peptides. Optionally different samples of the same peptide can be biotinylated at the amino and the carboxy terminus and immobilized in separate wells for purposes of comparison. This is useful for identifying end specific antigen binding proteins. Optionally additional peptides can be included terminating at a particular amino acid of interest. This approach is useful for identifying end specific antigen binding proteins to internal fragments of c fms or the extracellular domain of c fms . An antigen binding protein or immunologically functional fragment is screened for specific binding to each of the various peptides. The epitope is defined as occurring with a segment of amino acids that is common to all peptides to which the antigen binding protein shows specific binding. Details regarding a specific approach for defining an epitope are set forth in Example 12.

As demonstrated in Example 12 in one embodiment the antigen binding proteins provided herein are capable of binding a polypeptide that includes the Ig like domain 1 and the Ig like domain 2 in combination however they do not bind a polypeptide containing primarily the Ig like domain 1 or primarily the Ig like domain 2 alone. The binding epitopes of such antigen binding proteins are thus composed three dimensionally of the Ig like 1 and Ig like 2 domains in combination. As highlighted in these two domains comprise amino acids 20 through 223 of c fms extracellular domain which has the following amino acid sequence 

The amino acid sequence used in Example 12 to represent the Ig like 1 domain corresponds to amino acids 20 126 of the sequence depicted in i.e. amino acids 20 126 of SEQ ID NO 1 namely IPVIEPSVPELVVKPGATVTLRCVGNGSVEWDGPPSPHWTLYSDGSSSILSTNNATFQNTGTYRCT EPGDPLGGSAAIHLYVKDPARPWNVLAQEVVVFEDQDALLP . The amino acid sequence used to represent the Ig like 2 domain alone corresponded to amino acids 85 223 of the sequence depicted in i.e. amino acids 85 223 of SEQ ID NO 1 namely TEPGDPLGGSAAIHLYVKDPARPWNVLAQEVVVFEDQDALLPCLLTDPVLEAGVSLVRVRGRPL MRHTNYSFSPWHGFTIHRAKFIQSQDYQCSALMGGRKVMSISIRLKVQKVIPGPPALTLVPALVR1 RGEAAQIV .

Thus an antigen binding protein in one embodiment can bind or specifically bind to a region within a cfms protein e.g. the mature full length protein where the region has the amino acid sequence specified in SEQ ID NO 326. In some embodiments the antigen binding protein binds or specifically binds to a polypeptide consisting essentially of or consisting of the amino acids residues as set forth in SEQ ID NO 326.

In another embodiment the antigen binding protein can bind or specifically bind to a polypeptide consisting of SEQ ID NO 326 but not to a polypeptide consisting of amino acids 20 126 of the sequence depicted in i.e. amino acids 20 126 of SEQ ID NO 1 . In another aspect the antigen binding protein can bind or specifically bind to a polypeptide consisting of SEQ ID NO 326 but not to a polypeptide consisting of amino acids 85 223 of the sequence depicted in i.e. amino acids 85 223 of SEQ ID NO 1 . In yet another embodiment the antigen binding protein can bind or specifically bind to a polypeptide consisting of SEQ ID NO 326 but not to a polypeptide consisting of amino acids 20 126 of the sequence depicted in i.e. amino acids 20 126 of SEQ ID NO 1 or to a polypeptide consisting of amino acids 85 223 of the sequence depicted in i.e. amino acids 85 223 of SEQ ID NO 1 .

In another approach the domain s region s containing residues that are in contact with or are buried by an antibody can be identified by mutating specific residues in an antigen e.g. a wild type antigen and determining whether the antigen binding protein can bind the mutated protein. By making a number of individual mutations residues that play a direct role in binding or that are in sufficiently close proximity to the antibody such that a mutation can affect binding between the antigen binding protein and antigen can be identified. From a knowledge of these amino acids the domain s or region s of the antigen that contain residues in contact with the antigen binding protein or covered by the antibody can be elucidated. Such a domain typically includes the binding epitope of an antigen binding protein. One specific example of this general approach utilizes an arginine glutamic acid scanning protocol see e.g. Nanevicz T. et al. 1995270 37 21619 21625 and Zupnick A. et al. 2006281 29 20464 20473 . In general arginine and glutamic acids are substituted typically individually for an amino acid in the wild type polypeptide because these amino acids are charged and bulky and thus have the potential to disrupt binding between an antigen binding protein and an antigen in the region of the antigen where the mutation is introduced. Arginines and lysines that exist in the wild type antigen are replaced with glutamic acid. A variety of such individual mutants are obtained and the collected binding results analyzed to determine what residues affect binding.

Example 14 describes arginine glutamic acid scanning of human c fms for c fms binding proteins provided herein. A series of 95 mutant human c fms antigens were created with each mutant antigen having a single mutation. Binding of each mutant c fms antigen with selected c fms antigen binding proteins provided herein was measured and compared to the ability of these selected binding proteins to bind wild type c fms antigen SEQ ID NO 1 . A reduction in binding between an antigen binding protein and a mutant c fms antigen as used herein means that there is a reduction in binding affinity e.g. as measured by known methods such as Biacore testing as described in the examples and or a reduction in the total binding capacity of the antigen binding protein e.g. as evidenced by a decrease in Bmax in a plot of antigen binding protein concentration versus antigen concentration . A significant reduction in binding indicates that the mutated residue is directly involved in binding to the antigen binding protein or is in close proximity to the binding protein when the binding protein is bound to antigen.

In some embodiments a significant reduction in binding means that the binding affinity and or capacity between an antigen binding protein and a mutant c fms antigen is reduced by greater than 40 greater than 50 greater than 55 greater than 60 greater than 65 greater than 70 greater than 75 greater than 80 greater than 85 greater than 90 or greater than 95 relative to binding between the binding protein and a wild type c fms antigen e.g. the extracellular domain shown in SEQ ID NO 1 . In certain embodiments binding is reduced below detectable limits. In some embodiments a significant reduction in binding is evidenced when binding of an antigen binding protein to a mutant c fms antigen is less than 50 e.g. less than 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 or 10 of the binding observed between the antigen binding protein and a wild type c fms antigen e.g. the extracellular domain shown in SEQ ID NO 1 . Such binding measurements can be made using a variety of binding assays known in the art. A specific example of one such assay is described in Example 14.

In some embodiments antigen binding proteins are provided that exhibit significantly lower binding for a mutant c fms antigen in which a residue in a wild type c fms antigen e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 is substituted with arginine or glutamic acid. In one such embodiment binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced for a mutant c fms antigen having any one or more e.g. 1 2 3 or 4 of the following mutations E29R Q121R T152R and K185E as compared to a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In the shorthand notation used here the format is Wild type residue Position in polypeptide Mutant residue with the numbering of the residues as indicated in SEQ ID NO 1. In some embodiments binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced for a mutant c fms antigen having any one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 or 5 of the following mutations E29R Q121R S172R G274R and Y276R as compared to a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In another embodiment an antigen binding protein exhibits significantly lower binding for a mutant c fms antigen containing any one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 etc. up to 23 of the following mutations R106E H151R T152R Y154R S155R W159R Q171R S172R Q173R G183R R184E K185E E218R A220R S228R H239R N240R K259E G274R N275R Y276R S277R and N282R as compared to a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In even more embodiments binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced for a mutant c fms antigen containing any one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 or 5 of the following mutations K102E R144E R146E D174R and A226R as compared to binding to a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In still other embodiments an antigen binding protein exhibits significantly reduced binding for a mutant c fms antigen containing any one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 of the following mutations W50R A74R Y100R D122R T130R G161R Y175R and A179R as compared to a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 .

Although the mutant forms just listed are referenced with respect to the wild type extracellular domain sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 it will be appreciated that in an allelic variant of c fms the amino acid at the indicated position could differ. Antigen binding proteins showing significantly lower binding for such allelic forms of c fms are also contemplated. Accordingly in one embodiment an antigen binding protein has significantly reduced binding for an allelic c fms antigen as compared to a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 where one or more of the following residues e.g. 1 2 3 or 4 of the allelic antigen are replaced with arginine or glutamic acid as indicated 29R 121R 152R and 185E Position in polypeptide Mutant residue with the numbering of the residues as indicated in SEQ ID NO 1 . In some embodiments an antigen binding protein exhibits significantly reduced binding for an allelic c fms antigen in which one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 or 5 of the following residues are replaced with arginine or glutamic acid as indicated 29R 121R 172R 274R and 276R as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In another embodiment an antigen binding protein shows significantly reduced binding for an allelic c fms antigen in which one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 etc. up to 23 of the following residues are replaced with arginine or glutamic acid as indicated 106E 151R 152R 154R 155R 159R 171R 172R 173R 183R 184E 185E 218R 220R 228R 239R 240R 259E 274R 275R 276R 277R and 282R as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In even more embodiments an antigen binding protein has significantly reduced binding for an allelic c fms antigen in which any one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 or 5 of the following residues are replaced with arginine or glutamic acid as indicated 102E 144E 146E 174R and 226R as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In still other embodiments an antigen binding protein exhibits significantly reduced binding for an allelic c fms antigen in which any one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 of the following residues are replaced with arginine or glutamic acid as indicated 50R 74R 100R 122R 130R 161R 175R and 179R as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 .

In some embodiments binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced for a mutant c fms antigen in which the residue at a selected position in the wild type c fms antigen is mutated to any other residue. For instance in one embodiment an antigen binding protein exhibits significantly reduced binding for a mutant c fms antigen containing a single amino acid substitution at one or more e.g. 1 2 3 or 4 of positions 29 121 152 and 185 where the positions are as indicated in SEQ ID NO 1 as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In some embodiments an antigen binding protein has significantly reduced binding for a mutant c fms antigen containing a single amino acid substitution at one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 or 5 of positions 29 121 172 274 and 276 of SEQ ID NO 1 as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In another embodiment binding of an antigen binding protein is significantly reduced for a mutant c fms antigen containing a single amino acid substitution at one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 etc. up to 23 of positions 106 151 152 154 155 159 171 172 173 183 184 185 218 220 228 239 240 259 274 275 276 277 and 282 of SEQ ID NO 1 as compared to binding to a wild type c fms of SEQ ID NO 1. In even more embodiments an antigen binding protein has significantly lower binding for a mutant c fms antigen containing a single amino acid substitution at one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 or 5 of positions 102 144 146 174 and 226 of SEQ ID NO 1 as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 . In still other embodiments an antigen binding protein has significantly lower binding for a mutant c fms antigen containing a single amino acid substitution at one or more e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 of positions 50 74 100 122 130 161 175 and 179 as compared to its ability to bind a wild type c fms e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 .

As noted above residues directly involved in binding or covered by an antigen binding protein can be identified from scanning results. These residues can thus provide an indication of the domains or regions of SEQ ID NO 1 that contain the binding region s to which antigen binding proteins binds. As can be seen from the results summarized in Example 14 in one embodiment an antigen binding protein binds to a domain containing amino acids 29 185 of SEQ ID NO 1. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing amino acids 29 276 of SEQ ID NO 1. In other embodiments the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing amino acids 106 282 of SEQ ID NO 1. In still other embodiments the antigen binding protein binds to region containing amino acids 102 226 of SEQ ID NO 1. In yet another embodiment the antigen binding protein binds to a region containing amino acids 50 179 of SEQ ID NO 1. In some embodiments the antigen binding proteins binds to the foregoing regions within a fragment of the full length sequence of SEQ ID NO 1. In other embodiments antigen binding proteins bind to polypeptides consisting of these regions. In certain embodiments an antigen binding protein binds to a region containing amino acids 90 282 of SEQ ID NO 1. In another embodiment an antigen binding protein binds to one or both of the following regions amino acids 90 185 and amino acids 217 282 of SEQ ID NO 1. In yet another embodiment an antigen binding protein binds to one or both of the following regions amino acids 121 185 and amino acids 217 277 of SEQ ID NO 1.

In another aspect antigen binding proteins are provided that compete with one of the exemplified antibodies or functional fragments binding to the epitope described above for specific binding to c fms. Such antigen binding proteins may also bind to the same epitope as one of the herein exemplified antigen binding proteins or an overlapping epitope. Antigen binding proteins and fragments that compete with or bind to the same epitope as the exemplified antigen binding proteins are expected to show similar functional properties. The exemplified antigen binding proteins and fragments include those described above including those with the heavy and light chains variable region domains and CDRs included in TABLES 1 2 3 and 4A C. Thus as a specific example the antigen binding proteins that are provided include those that compete with an antibody having 

The antigen binding proteins that are provided include monoclonal antibodies that bind to c fms. Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using any technique known in the art e.g. by immortalizing spleen cells harvested from the transgenic animal after completion of the immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the art e.g. by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma producing fusion procedures preferably are non antibody producing have high fusion efficiency and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells hybridomas . Examples of suitable cell lines for use in mouse fusions include Sp 20 P3 X63 Ag8 P3 X63 Ag8.653 NS1 1.Ag 4 1 Sp210 Ag14 FO NSO U MPC 11 MPC11 X45 GTG 1.7 and S194 5XXO Bul examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210. RCY3 Y3 Ag 1.2.3 IR983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U 266 GM1500 GRG2 LICR LON HMy2 and UC729 6.

In some instances a hybridoma cell line is produced by immunizing an animal e.g. a transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin sequences with a c fms immunogen harvesting spleen cells from the immunized animal fusing the harvested spleen cells to a myeloma cell line thereby generating hybridoma cells establishing hybridoma cell lines from the hybridoma cells and identifying a hybridoma cell line that produces an antibody that binds a c fms polypeptide. Such hybridoma cell lines and anti c fms monoclonal antibodies produced by them are aspects of the present application.

Monoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be purified using any technique known in the art. Hybridomas or mAbs may be further screened to identify mAbs with particular properties such as the ability to block a Wnt induced activity. Examples of such screens are provided in the examples below.

Chimeric and humanized antibodies based upon the foregoing sequences are also provided. Monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutic agents may be modified in various ways prior to use. One example is a chimeric antibody which is an antibody composed of protein segments from different antibodies that are covalently joined to produce functional immunoglobulin light or heavy chains or immunologically functional portions thereof. Generally a portion of the heavy chain and or light chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. For methods relating to chimeric antibodies see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 198581 6851 6855 which are hereby incorporated by reference. CDR grafting is described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 180 370 No. 5 693 762 No. 5 693 761 No. 5 585 089 and No. 5 530 101.

Generally the goal of making a chimeric antibody is to create a chimera in which the number of amino acids from the intended patient species is maximized. One example is the CDR grafted antibody in which the antibody comprises one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the antibody chain s is are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. For use in humans the variable region or selected CDRs from a rodent antibody often are grafted into a human antibody replacing the naturally occurring variable regions or CDRs of the human antibody.

One useful type of chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Generally a humanized antibody is produced from a monoclonal antibody raised initially in a non human animal. Certain amino acid residues in this monoclonal antibody typically from non antigen recognizing portions of the antibody are modified to be homologous to corresponding residues in a human antibody of corresponding isotype. Humanization can be performed for example using various methods by substituting at least a portion of a rodent variable region for the corresponding regions of a human antibody see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 762 Jones et al. 1986321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988332 323 27 Verhoeyen et al. 1988239 1534 1536 

In one aspect the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies provided herein see TABLE 3 are grafted to framework regions FRs from antibodies from the same or a different phylogenetic species. For example the CDRs of the heavy and light chain variable regions V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 V13 V14 V15 V16 V17 V18 V19 V20 V21 V22 V23 V24 V25 V26 V27 V28 V29 V30 V31 and V32 and or V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 V13 V14 V15 V16 V17 V18 V19 V20 V21 V22 V23 V24 V25 V26 V27 V28 V29 V30 V31 V32 V33 and V34 can be grafted to consensus human FRs. To create consensus human FRs FRs from several human heavy chain or light chain amino acid sequences may be aligned to identify a consensus amino acid sequence. In other embodiments the FRs of a heavy chain or light chain disclosed herein are replaced with the FRs from a different heavy chain or light chain. In one aspect rare amino acids in the FRs of the heavy and light chains of anti c fms antibody are not replaced while the rest of the FR amino acids are replaced. A rare amino acid is a specific amino acid that is in a position in which this particular amino acid is not usually found in an FR. Alternatively the grafted variable regions from the one heavy or light chain may be used with a constant region that is different from the constant region of that particular heavy or light chain as disclosed herein. In other embodiments the grafted variable regions are part of a single chain Fv antibody.

In certain embodiments constant regions from species other than human can be used along with the human variable region s to produce hybrid antibodies.

Fully human antibodies are also provided. Methods are available for making fully human antibodies specific for a given antigen without exposing human beings to the antigen fully human antibodies . One specific means provided for implementing the production of fully human antibodies is the humanization of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin Ig loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated is one means of producing fully human monoclonal antibodies mAbs in mouse an animal that can be immunized with any desirable antigen. Using fully human antibodies can minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses that can sometimes be caused by administering mouse or mouse derived mAbs to humans as therapeutic agents.

Fully human antibodies can be produced by immunizing transgenic animals usually mice that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. Antigens for this purpose typically have six or more contiguous amino acids and optionally are conjugated to a carrier such as a hapten. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 199390 2551 2555 Jakobovits et al. 1993362 255 258 and Bruggermann et al. 19937 33. In one example of such a method transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin loci encoding the mouse heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein and inserting into the mouse genome large fragments of human genome DNA containing loci that encode human heavy and light chain proteins. Partially modified animals which have less than the full complement of human immunoglobulin loci are then cross bred to obtain an animal having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen these transgenic animals produce antibodies that are immunospecific for the immunogen but have human rather than murine amino acid sequences including the variable regions. For further details of such methods see for example WO96 33735 and WO94 02602. Additional methods relating to transgenic mice for making human antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 807 U.S. Pat. No. 6 713 610 U.S. Pat. No. 6 673 986 U.S. Pat. No. 6 162 963 U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 807 U.S. Pat. No. 6 300 129 U.S. Pat. No. 6 255 458 U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 397 U.S. Pat. No. 5 874 299 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 806 in PCT publications WO91 10741 WO90 04036 and in EP 546073B1 and EP 546073A1.

The transgenic mice described above referred to herein as HuMab mice contain a human immunoglobulin gene minilocus that encodes unrearranged human heavy mu and gamma and kappa light chain immunoglobulin sequences together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous mu and kappa chain loci Lonberg et al. 1994368 856 859 . Accordingly the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or kappa and in response to immunization and the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG kappa monoclonal antibodies Lonberg et al. supra. Lonberg and Huszar 199513 65 93 Harding and Lonberg 1995764 536 546 . The preparation of HuMab mice is described in detail in Taylor et al. 199220 6287 6295 Chen et al. 19935 647 656 Tuaillon et al. 1994152 2912 2920 Lonberg et al. 1994368 856 859 Lonberg 1994113 49 101 Taylor et al. 19946 579 591 Lonberg and Huszar 199513 65 93 Harding and Lonberg 1995764 536 546 Fishwild et al. 199614 845 851 the foregoing references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. See further U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 806 U.S. Pat. No. 5 569 825 U.S. Pat. No. 5 625 126 U.S. Pat. No. 5 633 425 U.S. Pat. No. 5 789 650 U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 397 U.S. Pat. No. 5 661 016 U.S. Pat. No. 5 814 318 U.S. Pat. No. 5 874 299 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 770 429 as well as U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 807 International Publication Nos. WO 93 1227 WO 92 22646 and WO 92 03918 the disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. Technologies utilized for producing human antibodies in these transgenic mice are disclosed also in WO 98 24893 and Mendez et al. 199715 146 156 which are hereby incorporated by reference. For example the HCo7 and HCo12 transgenic mice strains can be used to generate anti c fms antibodies. Further details regarding the production of human antibodies using transgenic mice are provided in the examples below.

Using hybridoma technology antigen specific human mAbs with the desired specificity can be produced and selected from the transgenic mice such as those described above. Such antibodies may be cloned and expressed using a suitable vector and host cell or the antibodies can be harvested from cultured hybridoma cells.

Fully human antibodies can also be derived from phage display libraries as disclosed in Hoogenboom et al. 1991227 381 and Marks et al. 1991222 581 . Phage display techniques mimic immune selection through the display of antibody repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to an antigen of choice. One such technique is described in PCT Publication No. WO 99 10494 hereby incorporated by reference which describes the isolation of high affinity and functional agonistic antibodies for MPL and msk receptors using such an approach.

The antigen binding proteins that are provided also include bispecific and bifunctional antibodies that include one or more CDRs or one or more variable regions as described above. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody in some instances is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including but not limited to fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments. See e.g. Songsivilai and Lachmann 199079 315 321 Kostelny et al. 1992148 1547 1553.

Some of the antigen binding proteins that are provided are variant forms of the antigen binding proteins disclosed above e.g. those having the sequences listed in TABLES 1 4 . For instance some of the antigen binding proteins have one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in one or more of the heavy or light chains variable regions or CDRs listed in TABLES 1 4.

Conservative amino acid substitutions may involve exchange of a member of one of these classes with another member of the same class. Conservative amino acid substitutions may encompass non naturally occurring amino acid residues which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.

Non conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one of the above classes for a member from another class. Such substituted residues may be introduced into regions of the antibody that are homologous with human antibodies or into the non homologous regions of the molecule.

In making such changes according to certain embodiments the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. The hydropathic profile of a protein is calculated by assigning each amino acid a numerical value hydropathy index and then repetitively averaging these values along the peptide chain. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are isoleucine 4.5 valine 4.2 leucine 3.8 phenylalanine 2.8 cysteine cystine 2.5 methionine 1.9 alanine 1.8 glycine 0.4 threonine 0.7 serine 0.8 tryptophan 0.9 tyrosine 1.3 proline 1.6 histidine 3.2 glutamate 3.5 glutamine 3.5 aspartate 3.5 asparagine 3.5 lysine 3.9 and arginine 4.5 .

The importance of the hydropathic profile in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art see e.g. Kyte et al. 1982157 105 131 . It is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index in certain embodiments the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within 2 is included. In some aspects those which are within 1 are included and in other aspects those within 0.5 are included.

It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments as in the present case. In certain embodiments the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids correlates with its immunogenicity and antigen binding or immunogenicity that is with a biological property of the protein.

The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues arginine 3.0 lysine 3.0 aspartate 3.0 1 glutamate 3.0 1 serine 0.3 asparagine 0.2 glutamine 0.2 glycine 0 threonine 0.4 proline 0.5 1 alanine 0.5 histidine 0.5 cysteine 1.0 methionine 1.3 valine 1.5 leucine 1.8 isoleucine 1.8 tyrosine 2.3 phenylalanine 2.5 and tryptophan 3.4 . In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values in certain embodiments the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within 2 is included in other embodiments those which are within 1 are included and in still other embodiments those within 0.5 are included. In some instances one may also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as epitopic core regions. 

A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of polypeptides as set forth herein using well known techniques. One skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. The skilled artisan also will be able to identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In further embodiments even areas that may be important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.

Additionally one skilled in the art can review structure function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.

One skilled in the art can also analyze the 3 dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. One skilled in the art may choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. These variants can then be screened using assays for c fms neutralizing activity see examples below thus yielding information regarding which amino acids can be changed and which must not be changed. In other words based on information gathered from such routine experiments one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acid positions where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.

A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult 19967 422 427 Chou et al. 197413 222 245 Chou et al. 1974113 211 222 Chou et al. 197847 45 148 Chou et al. 197947 251 276 and Chou et al. 197926 367 384. Moreover computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example two polypeptides or proteins that have a sequence identity of greater than 30 or similarity greater than 40 can have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database PDB has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide s or protein s structure. See Holm et al. 199927 244 247. It has been suggested Brenner et al. 19977 369 376 that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.

Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include threading Jones 19977 377 387 Sippl et al. 19964 15 19 profile analysis Bowie et al. 1991253 164 170 Gribskov et al. 1990183 146 159 Gribskov et al. 198784 4355 4358 and evolutionary linkage See Holm 1999 supra and Brenner 1997 supra .

In some embodiments amino acid substitutions are made that 1 reduce susceptibility to proteolysis 2 reduce susceptibility to oxidation 3 alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes 4 alter ligand or antigen binding affinities and or 4 confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. For example single or multiple amino acid substitutions in certain embodiments conservative amino acid substitutions may be made in the naturally occurring sequence. Substitutions can be made in that portion of the antibody that lies outside the domain s forming intermolecular contacts . In such embodiments conservative amino acid substitutions can be used that do not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence e.g. one or more replacement amino acids that do not disrupt the secondary structure that characterizes the parent or native antigen binding protein . Examples of art recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins Structures and Molecular Principles Creighton Ed. 1984 W. H. New York Freeman and Company Introduction to Protein Structure Branden and Tooze eds. 1991 New York Garland Publishing and Thornton et al. 1991354 105 which are each incorporated herein by reference.

Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues in the parent or native amino acid sequence are deleted from or substituted with another amino acid e.g. serine . Cysteine variants are useful inter alia when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation. Cysteine variants may have fewer cysteine residues than the native antibody and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.

The heavy and light chains variable regions domains and CDRs that are disclosed can be used to prepare polypeptides that contain an antigen binding region that can specifically bind to a c fms polypeptide. For example one or more of the CDRs listed in TABLES 3 and 4 can be incorporated into a molecule e.g. a polypeptide covalently or noncovalently to make an immunoadhesion. An immunoadhesion may incorporate the CDR s as part of a larger polypeptide chain may covalently link the CDR s to another polypeptide chain or may incorporate the CDR s noncovalently. The CDR s enable the immunoadhesion to bind specifically to a particular antigen of interest e.g. a c fms polypeptide or epitope thereof .

Mimetics e.g. peptide mimetics or peptidomimetics based upon the variable region domains and CDRs that are described herein are also provided. These analogs can be peptides non peptides or combinations of peptide and non peptide regions. Fauchere 198615 29 Veber and Freidinger 1985p. 392 and Evans et al. 198730 1229 which are incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce a similar therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Generally peptidomimetics are proteins that are structurally similar to an antibody displaying a desired biological activity such as here the ability to specifically bind c fms but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from CHNH CHS CH CH CH CH cis and trans COCH CH OH CH and CHSO by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D amino acid of the same type e.g. D lysine in place of L lysine may be used in certain embodiments to generate more stable proteins. In addition constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art Rizo and Gierasch 199261 387 incorporated herein by reference for example by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.

Derivatives of the antigen binding proteins that are described herein are also provided. The derivatized antigen binding proteins can comprise any molecule or substance that imparts a desired property to the antibody or fragment such as increased half life in a particular use. The derivatized antigen binding protein can comprise for example a detectable or labeling moiety e.g. a radioactive colorimetric antigenic or enzymatic molecule a detectable bead such as a magnetic or electrodense e.g. gold bead or a molecule that binds to another molecule e.g. biotin or streptavidin a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety e.g. a radioactive cytotoxic or pharmaceutically active moiety or a molecule that increases the suitability of the antigen binding protein for a particular use e.g. administration to a subject such as a human subject or other in vivo or in vitro uses . Examples of molecules that can be used to derivatize an antigen binding protein include albumin e.g. human serum albumin and polyethylene glycol PEG . Albumin linked and PEGylated derivatives of antigen binding proteins can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. Certain antigen binding proteins include a pegylated single chain polypeptide as described herein. In one embodiment the antigen binding protein is conjugated or otherwise linked to transthyretin TTR or a TTR variant. The TTR or TTR variant can be chemically modified with for example a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycols propropylene glycol homopolymers polypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols.

Other derivatives include covalent or aggregative conjugates of c fms antigen binding proteins with other proteins or polypeptides such as by expression of recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N terminus or C terminus of a c fms antigen binding protein. For example the conjugated peptide may be a heterologous signal or leader polypeptide e.g. the yeast alpha factor leader or a peptide such as an epitope tag. C fins antigen binding protein containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of the c fms antigen binding protein e.g. poly His . A c fms antigen binding protein also can be linked to the FLAG peptide as described in Hopp et al. 19886 1204 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 011 912. The FLAG peptide is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody mAb enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are commercially available Sigma St. Louis Mo. .

Oligomers that contain one or more c fms antigen binding proteins may be employed as c fms antagonists. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently linked or non covalently linked dimers trimers or higher oligomers. Oligomers comprising two or more c fms antigen binding proteins are contemplated for use with one example being a homodimer. Other oligomers include heterodimers homotrimers heterotrimers homotetramers heterotetramers etc.

One embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple c fms binding polypeptides joined via covalent or non covalent interactions between peptide moieties fused to the c fms antigen binding proteins. Such peptides may be peptide linkers spacers or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of c fms antigen binding proteins attached thereto as described in more detail below.

In particular embodiments the oligomers comprise from two to four c fms antigen binding proteins. The c fms antigen binding protein moieties of the oligomer may be in any of the forms described above e.g. variants or fragments. Preferably the oligomers comprise c fms antigen binding proteins that have c fms binding activity.

In one embodiment an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides fused to various portions of antibody derived polypeptides including the Fc domain has been described e.g. by Ashkenazi et al. 199188 10535 Byrn et al. 1990344 677 and Hollenbaugh et al. 1992 Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins in Current Protocols in Immunology Suppl. 4 pages 10.19.1 10.19.11.

One embodiment is directed to a dimer comprising two fusion proteins created by fusing a c fms antigen binding protein to the Fc region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by for example inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer

The term Fc polypeptide as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties and oligomers formed therefrom offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.

One suitable Fc polypeptide described in PCT application WO 93 10151 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 426 048 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 262 522 is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N terminal hinge region to the native C terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG1 antibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 457 035 and in Baum et al. 199413 3992 4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93 10151 except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala amino acid 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors.

In other embodiments the variable portion of the heavy and or light chains of a c fms antigen binding protein such as disclosed herein may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and or light chain.

Alternatively the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple c fms antigen binding proteins with or without peptide linkers spacer peptides . Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 751 180 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 935 233.

Another method for preparing oligomeric c fms antigen binding protein derivatives involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA binding proteins Landschulz et al. 1988240 1759 and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in PCT application WO 94 10308 and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D SPD described in Hoppe et al. 1994344 191 hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al. 19946 267 278. In one approach recombinant fusion proteins comprising a c fms antigen binding protein fragment or derivative fused to a leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells and the soluble oligomeric c fms antigen binding protein fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant.

Some antigen binding proteins that are provided have an on rate k for c fms of at least 10 M seconds at least 10 M seconds at least 10 M seconds measured for instance as described in the examples below. Certain antigen binding proteins that are provided have a slow dissociation rate or off rate. Some antigen binding proteins for instance have a k off rate of 1 10s or 1 10s or 1 10s or 1 10s. In certain embodiments the antigen binding protein has a K equilibrium binding affinity of less than 25 pM 50 pM 100 pM 500 pM 1 nM 5 nM 10 nM 25 nM or 50 nM.

Another aspect provides an antigen binding protein having a half life of at least one day in vitro or in vivo e.g. when administered to a human subject . In one embodiment the antigen binding protein has a half life of at least three days. In another embodiment the antibody or portion thereof has a half life of four days or longer. In another embodiment the antibody or portion thereof has a half life of eight days or longer. In another embodiment the antibody or antigen binding portion thereof is derivatized or modified such that it has a longer half life as compared to the underivatized or unmodified antibody. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein contains point mutations to increase serum half life such as described in WO 00 09560 published Feb. 24 2000 incorporated by reference.

The antigen binding protein may have a glycosylation pattern that is different or altered from that found in the native species. As is known in the art glycosylation patterns can depend on both the sequence of the protein e.g. the presence or absence of particular glycosylation amino acid residues discussed below or the host cell or organism in which the protein is produced. Particular expression systems are discussed below.

Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tri peptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tri peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N acetylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antigen binding protein is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tri peptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the starting sequence for O linked glycosylation sites . For ease the antigen binding protein amino acid sequence may be altered through changes at the DNA level particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the target polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.

Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the antigen binding protein is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the protein. These procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the protein in a host cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N and O linked glycosylation. Depending on the coupling mode used the sugar s may be attached to a arginine and histidine b free carboxyl groups c free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine d free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine threonine or hydroxyproline e aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine tyrosine or tryptophan or f the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87 05330 published Sep. 11 1987 and in Aplin and Wriston 1981. pp. 259 306.

Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the starting antigen binding protein may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation requires exposure of the protein to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar N acetylglucosamine or N acetylgalactosamine while leaving the polypeptide intact. Chemical deglycosylation is described by Hakimuddin et al. 1987259 52 and by Edge et al. 1981118 131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo and exo glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. 1987138 350. Glycosylation at potential glycosylation sites may be prevented by the use of the compound tunicamycin as described by Duskin et al. 1982257 3105. Tunicamycin blocks the formation of protein N glycoside linkages.

Hence aspects include glycosylation variants of the antigen binding proteins wherein the number and or type of glycosylation site s has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of the parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments antibody protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N linked glycosylation sites than the native antibody. An N linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence Asn X Ser or Asn X Thr wherein the amino acid residue designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively substitutions that eliminate or alter this sequence will prevent addition of an N linked carbohydrate chain present in the native polypeptide. For example the glycosylation can be reduced by the deletion of an Asn or by substituting the Asn with a different amino acid. In other embodiments one or more new N linked sites are created. Antibodies typically have a N linked glycosylation site in the Fc region.

Examples of suitable groups include calicheamicin auristatins geldanamycin and maytansine. In some embodiments the effector group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.

In general labels fall into a variety of classes depending on the assay in which they are to be detected a isotopic labels which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes b magnetic labels e.g. magnetic particles c redox active moieties d optical dyes enzymatic groups e.g. horseradish peroxidase galactosidase luciferase alkaline phosphatase e biotinylated groups and f predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter e.g. leucine zipper pair sequences binding sites for secondary antibodies metal binding domains epitope tags etc. . In some embodiments the labeling group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.

Nucleic acids that encode for the antigen binding proteins described herein or portions thereof are also provided including nucleic acids encoding one or both chains of an antibody or a fragment derivative mutein or variant thereof polynucleotides encoding heavy chain variable regions or only CDRs polynucleotides sufficient for use as hybridization probes PCR primers or sequencing primers for identifying analyzing mutating or amplifying a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide anti sense nucleic acids for inhibiting expression of a polynucleotide and complementary sequences of the foregoing. The nucleic acids can be any length. They can be for example 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 750 1 000 1 500 3 000 5 000 or more nucleotides in length and or can comprise one or more additional sequences for example regulatory sequences and or be part of a larger nucleic acid for example a vector. The nucleic acids can be single stranded or double stranded and can comprise RNA and or DNA nucleotides and artificial variants thereof e.g. peptide nucleic acids . TABLE 6 shows exemplary nucleic acid sequences encoding an IgG2 heavy chain constant region and IgG2 kappa light chain constant region. Any variable region provided herein may be attached to these constant regions to form complete heavy and light chain sequences. However it should be understood that these constant regions sequences are provided as specific examples only. In some embodiments the variable region sequences are joined to other constant region sequences that are known in the art. Exemplary nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy and light chain variable regions are provided in TABLE 7.

TABLE 7 shows exemplary nucleic acid sequences encoding heavy chain and light chain variable regions in which the various CDRH1 CDRH2 CDRH3 CDRL1 CDRL2 and CDRL3 sequences are embedded.

Nucleic acids encoding certain antigen binding proteins or portions thereof e.g. full length antibody heavy or light chain variable domain or CDRH1 CDRH2 CDRH3 CDRL1 CDRL2 or CDRL3 may be isolated from B cells of mice that have been immunized with c fms or an immunogenic fragment thereof. The nucleic acid may be isolated by conventional procedures such as polymerase chain reaction PCR . Phage display is another example of a known technique whereby derivatives of antibodies and other antigen binding proteins may be prepared. In one approach polypeptides that are components of an antigen binding protein of interest are expressed in any suitable recombinant expression system and the expressed polypeptides are allowed to assemble to form antigen binding protein molecules.

The nucleic acids provided in TABLES 6 and 7 are exemplary only. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code each of the polypeptide sequences listed in TABLES 1 4 or otherwise depicted herein are also encoded by a large number of other nucleic acid sequences besides those provided. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present application thus provides adequate written description and enablement for each degenerate nucleotide sequence encoding each antigen binding protein.

An aspect further provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids e.g. nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence listed in TABLE 6 and TABLE 7 under particular hybridization conditions. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well known in the art. See e.g. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons N.Y. 1989 6.3.1 6.3.6. As defined herein a moderately stringent hybridization condition uses a prewashing solution containing 5 sodium chloride sodium citrate SSC 0.5 SDS 1.0 mM EDTA pH 8.0 hybridization buffer of about 50 formamide 6 SSC and a hybridization temperature of 55 C. or other similar hybridization solutions such as one containing about 50 formamide with a hybridization temperature of 42 C. and washing conditions of 60 C. in 0.5 SSC 0.1 SDS. A stringent hybridization condition hybridizes in 6 SSC at 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1 SSC 0.2 SDS at 68 C. Furthermore one of skill in the art can manipulate the hybridization and or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of hybridization such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences that are at least 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 98 or 99 identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other.

The basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by for example Sambrook Fritsch and Maniatis 2001 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. supra and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology 1995 Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons Inc. sections 2.10 and 6.3 6.4 and can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on e.g. the length and or base composition of the nucleic acid.

Changes can be introduced by mutation into a nucleic acid thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide e.g. an antibody or antibody derivative that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced using any technique known in the art. In one embodiment one or more particular amino acid residues are changed using for example a site directed mutagenesis protocol. In another embodiment one or more randomly selected residues is changed using for example a random mutagenesis protocol. However it is made a mutant polypeptide can be expressed and screened for a desired property.

Mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid without significantly altering the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non essential amino acid residues. Alternatively one or more mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid that selectively changes the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example the mutation can quantitatively or qualitatively change the biological activity. Examples of quantitative changes include increasing reducing or eliminating the activity. Examples of qualitative changes include changing the antigen specificity of an antibody. In one embodiment a nucleic acid encoding any antigen binding protein described herein can be mutated to alter the amino acid sequence using molecular biology techniques that are well established in the art. Example 4 for instance describes how nucleic acid sequences see Table 6 were mutated to introduce one or more amino acid substitutions into certain antigen binding proteins to produce antigen binding proteins 1.2 SM 1.109 SM and 2.360 SM. Additional antigen binding proteins containing other mutations can be produced in a similar way.

Another aspect provides nucleic acid molecules that are suitable for use as primers or hybridization probes for the detection of nucleic acid sequences. A nucleic acid molecule can comprise only a portion of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a full length polypeptide for example a fragment that can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding an active portion e.g. a c fms binding portion of a polypeptide.

Probes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid can be used to detect the nucleic acid or similar nucleic acids for example transcripts encoding a polypeptide. The probe can comprise a label group e.g. a radioisotope a fluorescent compound an enzyme or an enzyme co factor. Such probes can be used to identify a cell that expresses the polypeptide.

Another aspect provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide or a portion thereof e.g. a fragment containing one or more CDRs or one or more variable region domains . Examples of vectors include but are not limited to plasmids viral vectors non episomal mammalian vectors and expression vectors for example recombinant expression vectors. The recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. The recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Regulatory sequences include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells e.g. SV40 early gene enhancer Rous sarcoma virus promoter and cytomegalovirus promoter those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells e.g. tissue specific regulatory sequences see Voss et al. 198611 287 Maniatis et al. 1987236 1237 incorporated by reference herein in their entireties and those that direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in response to particular treatment or condition e.g. the metallothionin promoter in mammalian cells and the tet responsive and or streptomycin responsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems see id. . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed the level of expression of protein desired etc. The expression vectors can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides including fusion proteins or peptides encoded by nucleic acids as described herein.

Another aspect provides host cells into which a recombinant expression vector has been introduced. A host cell can be any prokaryotic cell for example or eukaryotic cell for example yeast insect or mammalian cells e.g. CHO cells . Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. For stable transfection of mammalian cells it is known that depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants a gene that encodes a selectable marker e.g. for resistance to antibiotics is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs such as G418 hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection e.g. cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive while the other cells die among other methods.

Non human antibodies that are provided can be for example derived from any antibody producing animal such as mouse rat rabbit goat donkey or non human primate such as monkey e.g. cynomologous or rhesus monkey or ape e.g. chimpanzee . Non human antibodies can be used for instance in in vitro cell culture and cell culture based applications or any other application where an immune response to the antibody does not occur or is insignificant can be prevented is not a concern or is desired. In certain embodiments the antibodies may be produced by immunizing with full length c fms or with the extracellular domain of c fms. Alternatively the certain non human antibodies may be raised by immunizing with amino acids which are segments of c fms that form part of the epitope to which certain antibodies provided herein bind see infra . The antibodies may be polyclonal monoclonal or may be synthesized in host cells by expressing recombinant DNA.

Fully human antibodies may be prepared as described above by immunizing transgenic animals containing human immunoglobulin loci or by selecting a phage display library that is expressing a repertoire of human antibodies.

The monoclonal antibodies mAbs can be produced by a variety of techniques including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g. the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein 1975256 495. Alternatively other techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies can be employed for example the viral or oncogenic transformation of B lymphocytes. One suitable animal system for preparing hybridomas is the murine system which is a very well established procedure. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art. For such procedures B cells from immunized mice are fused with a suitable immortalized fusion partner such as a murine myeloma cell line. If desired rats or other mammals besides can be immunized instead of mice and B cells from such animals can be fused with the murine myeloma cell line to form hybridomas. Alternatively a myeloma cell line from a source other than mouse may be used. Fusion procedures for making hybridomas also are well known.

The single chain antibodies that are provided may be formed by linking heavy and light chain variable domain Fv region fragments via an amino acid bridge short peptide linker resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single chain Fvs scFvs may be prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable domain polypeptides Vand V . The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen binding monomers or they can form multimers e.g. dimers trimers or tetramers depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains Kortt et al. 199710 423 Kortt et al. 200118 95 108 . By combining different Vand V comprising polypeptides one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes Kriangkum et al. 200118 31 40 . Techniques developed for the production of single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird 1988242 423 Huston et al. 198885 5879 Ward et al. 1989334 544 de Graaf et al. 2002178 379 387. Single chain antibodies derived from antibodies provided herein include but are not limited to scFvs comprising the variable domain combinations of the heavy and light chain variable regions depicted in TABLE 2 or combinations of light and heavy chain variable domains which include CDRs depicted in TABLES 3 and 4.

Antibodies provided herein that are of one subclass can be changed to antibodies from a different subclass using subclass switching methods. Thus IgG antibodies may be derived from an IgM antibody for example and vice versa. Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen binding properties of a given antibody the parent antibody but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be employed in such procedures e.g. DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See e.g. Lantto et al. 2002178 303 316.

Accordingly the antibodies that are provided include those comprising for example the variable domain combinations described supra. having a desired isotype for example IgA IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgE and IgD as well as Fab or F ab fragments thereof. Moreover if an IgG4 is desired it may also be desired to introduce a point mutation CPSCP CPPCP in the hinge region as described in Bloom et al. 19976 407 incorporated by reference herein to alleviate a tendency to form intra H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgG4 antibodies.

Moreover techniques for deriving antibodies having different properties i.e. varying affinities for the antigen to which they bind are also known. One such technique referred to as chain shuffling involves displaying immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage often referred to as phage display. Chain shuffling has been used to prepare high affinity antibodies to the hapten 2 phenyloxazol 5 one as described by Marks et al. 199210 779.

Conservative modifications may be made to the heavy and light chain variable regions described in TABLE 2 or the CDRs described in TABLE 3 and 4 and corresponding modifications to the encoding nucleic acids to produce a c fms antigen binding protein having functional and biochemical characteristics. Methods for achieving such modifications are described above.

C fms antigen binding proteins may be further modified in various ways. For example if they are to be used for therapeutic purposes they may be conjugated with polyethylene glycol pegylated to prolong the serum half life or to enhance protein delivery. Alternatively the V region of the subject antibodies or fragments thereof may be fused with the Fc region of a different antibody molecule. The Fc region used for this purpose may be modified so that it does not bind complement thus reducing the likelihood of inducing cell lysis in the patient when the fusion protein is used as a therapeutic agent. In addition the subject antibodies or functional fragments thereof may be conjugated with human serum albumin to enhance the serum half life of the antibody or fragment thereof. Another useful fusion partner for the antigen binding proteins or fragments thereof is transthyretin TTR . TTR has the capacity to form a tetramer thus an antibody TTR fusion protein can form a multivalent antibody which may increase its binding avidity.

Alternatively substantial modifications in the functional and or biochemical characteristics of the antigen binding proteins described herein may be achieved by creating substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulkiness of the side chain. A conservative amino acid substitution may involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a normative residue that has little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position. See TABLE 3 supra. Furthermore any native residue in the polypeptide may also be substituted with alanine as has been previously described for alanine scanning mutagenesis.

Amino acid substitutions whether conservative or non conservative of the subject antibodies can be implemented by those skilled in the art by applying routine techniques. Amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of the antibodies provided herein or to increase or decrease the affinity of these antibodies for human c fms or for modifying the binding affinity of other antigen binding proteins described herein.

Expression systems and constructs in the form of plasmids expression vectors transcription or expression cassettes that comprise at least one polynucleotide as described above are also provided herein as well host cells comprising such expression systems or constructs.

The antigen binding proteins provided herein may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example c fms antigen binding proteins may be produced by recombinant expression systems using any technique known in the art. See e.g. Monoclonal Antibodies Hybridomas A New Dimension in Biological Analyses Kennet et al. eds. Plenum Press New York 1980 and Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Harlow and Lane eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1988 .

Antigen binding proteins can be expressed in hybridoma cell lines e.g. in particular antibodies may be expressed in hybridomas or in cell lines other than hybridomas. Expression constructs encoding the antibodies can be used to transform a mammalian insect or microbial host cell. Transformation can be performed using any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell including for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus or bacteriophage and transducing a host cell with the construct by transfection procedures known in the art as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 4 399 216 U.S. Pat. No. 4 912 040 U.S. Pat. No. 4 740 461 U.S. Pat. No. 4 959 455. The optimal transformation procedure used will depend upon which type of host cell is being transformed. Methods for introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include but are not limited to dextran mediated transfection calcium phosphate precipitation polybrene mediated transfection protoplast fusion electroporation encapsulation of the polynucleotide s in liposomes mixing nucleic acid with positively charged lipids and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.

Recombinant expression constructs typically comprise a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide comprising one or more of the following one or more CDRs provided herein a light chain constant region a light chain variable region a heavy chain constant region e.g. C1 C2 and or C3 and or another scaffold portion of a c fms antigen binding protein. These nucleic acid sequences are inserted into an appropriate expression vector using standard ligation techniques. In one embodiment the heavy or light chain constant region is appended to the C terminus of the anti c fms specific heavy or light chain variable region and is ligated into an expression vector. The vector is typically selected to be functional in the particular host cell employed i.e. the vector is compatible with the host cell machinery permitting amplification and or expression of the gene can occur . In some embodiments vectors are used that employ protein fragment complementation assays using protein reporters such as dihydrofolate reductase see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 270 964 which is hereby incorporated by reference . Suitable expression vectors can be purchased for example from Invitrogen Life Technologies or BD Biosciences formerly Clontech . Other useful vectors for cloning and expressing the antibodies and fragments include those described in Bianchi and McGrew 200384 439 44 which is hereby incorporated by reference. Additional suitable expression vectors are discussed for example in 185 D. V. Goeddel ed. 1990 New York Academic Press.

Typically expression vectors used in any of the host cells will contain sequences for plasmid maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous nucleotide sequences. Such sequences collectively referred to as flanking sequences in certain embodiments will typically include one or more of the following nucleotide sequences a promoter one or more enhancer sequences an origin of replication a transcriptional termination sequence a complete intron sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice site a sequence encoding a leader sequence for polypeptide secretion a ribosome binding site a polyadenylation sequence a polylinker region for inserting the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide to be expressed and a selectable marker element. Each of these sequences is discussed below.

Optionally the vector may contain a tag encoding sequence i.e. an oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5 or 3 end of the c fms antigen binding protein coding sequence the oligonucleotide sequence encodes polyHis such as hexaHis or another tag such as FLAG HA hemaglutinin influenza virus or myc for which commercially available antibodies exist. This tag is typically fused to the polypeptide upon expression of the polypeptide and can serve as a means for affinity purification or detection of the c fms antigen binding protein from the host cell. Affinity purification can be accomplished for example by column chromatography using antibodies against the tag as an affinity matrix. Optionally the tag can subsequently be removed from the purified c fms antigen binding protein by various means such as using certain peptidases for cleavage.

Flanking sequences may be homologous i.e. from the same species and or strain as the host cell heterologous i.e. from a species other than the host cell species or strain hybrid i.e. a combination of flanking sequences from more than one source synthetic or native. As such the source of a flanking sequence may be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism any vertebrate or invertebrate organism or any plant provided that the flanking sequence is functional in and can be activated by the host cell machinery.

Flanking sequences useful in the vectors may be obtained by any of several methods well known in the art. Typically flanking sequences useful herein will have been previously identified by mapping and or by restriction endonuclease digestion and can thus be isolated from the proper tissue source using the appropriate restriction endonucleases. In some cases the full nucleotide sequence of a flanking sequence may be known. Here the flanking sequence may be synthesized using the methods described herein for nucleic acid synthesis or cloning.

Whether all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known it may be obtained using polymerase chain reaction PCR and or by screening a genomic library with a suitable probe such as an oligonucleotide and or flanking sequence fragment from the same or another species. Where the flanking sequence is not known a fragment of DNA containing a flanking sequence may be isolated from a larger piece of DNA that may contain for example a coding sequence or even another gene or genes. Isolation may be accomplished by restriction endonuclease digestion to produce the proper DNA fragment followed by isolation using agarose gel purification Qiagen column chromatography Chatsworth Calif. or other methods known to the skilled artisan. The selection of suitable enzymes to accomplish this purpose will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

An origin of replication is typically a part of those prokaryotic expression vectors purchased commercially and the origin aids in the amplification of the vector in a host cell. If the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site one may be chemically synthesized based on a known sequence and ligated into the vector. For example the origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 New England Biolabs Beverly Mass. is suitable for most gram negative bacteria and various viral origins e.g. SV40 polyoma adenovirus vesicular stomatitus virus VSV or papillomaviruses such as HPV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors for example the SV40 origin is often used only because it also contains the virus early promoter .

A transcription termination sequence is typically located 3 to the end of a polypeptide coding region and serves to terminate transcription. Usually a transcription termination sequence in prokaryotic cells is a G C rich fragment followed by a poly T sequence. While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or even purchased commercially as part of a vector it can also be readily synthesized using methods for nucleic acid synthesis such as those described herein.

A selectable marker gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival and growth of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin tetracycline or kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells b complement auxotrophic deficiencies of the cell or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex or defined media. Specific selectable markers are the kanamycin resistance gene the ampicillin resistance gene and the tetracycline resistance gene. Advantageously a neomycin resistance gene may also be used for selection in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.

Other selectable genes may be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed. Amplification is the process wherein genes that are required for production of a protein critical for growth or cell survival are reiterated in tandem within the chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells. Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells include dihydrofolate reductase DHFR and promoterless thymidine kinase genes. Mammalian cell transformants are placed under selection pressure wherein only the transformants are uniquely adapted to survive by virtue of the selectable gene present in the vector. Selection pressure is imposed by culturing the transformed cells under conditions in which the concentration of selection agent in the medium is successively increased thereby leading to the amplification of both the selectable gene and the DNA that encodes another gene such as an antigen binding protein that binds to c fms polypeptide. As a result increased quantities of a polypeptide such as an antigen binding protein are synthesized from the amplified DNA.

A ribosome binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of mRNA and is characterized by a Shine Dalgarno sequence prokaryotes or a Kozak sequence eukaryotes . The element is typically located 3 to the promoter and 5 to the coding sequence of the polypeptide to be expressed.

In some cases such as where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell expression system one may manipulate the various pre or pro sequences to improve glycosylation or yield. For example one may alter the peptidase cleavage site of a particular signal peptide or add prosequences which also may affect glycosylation. The final protein product may have in the 1 position relative to the first amino acid of the mature protein one or more additional amino acids incident to expression which may not have been totally removed. For example the final protein product may have one or two amino acid residues found in the peptidase cleavage site attached to the amino terminus. Alternatively use of some enzyme cleavage sites may result in a slightly truncated form of the desired polypeptide if the enzyme cuts at such area within the mature polypeptide.

Expression and cloning will typically contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to the molecule encoding c fms antigen binding protein. Promoters are untranscribed sequences located upstream i.e. 5 to the start codon of a structural gene generally within about 100 to 1000 bp that control transcription of the structural gene. Promoters are conventionally grouped into one of two classes inducible promoters and constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions such as the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters on the other hand uniformly transcribe a gene to which they are operably linked that is with little or no control over gene expression. A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. A suitable promoter is operably linked to the DNA encoding heavy chain or light chain comprising a c fms antigen binding protein by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the desired promoter sequence into the vector.

Suitable promoters for use with yeast hosts are also well known in the art. Yeast enhancers are advantageously used with yeast promoters. Suitable promoters for use with mammalian host cells are well known and include but are not limited to those obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus retroviruses hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 .

An enhancer sequence may be inserted into the vector to increase transcription of DNA encoding light chain or heavy chain comprising a human c fms antigen binding protein by higher eukaryotes. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA usually about 10 300 bp in length that act on the promoter to increase transcription. Enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent having been found at positions both 5 and 3 to the transcription unit. Several enhancer sequences available from mammalian genes are known e.g. globin elastase albumin alpha feto protein and insulin . Typically however an enhancer from a virus is used. The SV40 enhancer the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer and adenovirus enhancers known in the art are exemplary enhancing elements for the activation of eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer may be positioned in the vector either 5 or 3 to a coding sequence it is typically located at a site 5 from the promoter. A sequence encoding an appropriate native or heterologous signal sequence leader sequence or signal peptide can be incorporated into an expression vector to promote extracellular secretion of the antibody. The choice of signal peptide or leader depends on the type of host cells in which the antibody is to be produced and a heterologous signal sequence can replace the native signal sequence. Examples of signal peptides that are functional in mammalian host cells include the following the signal sequence for interleukin 7 IL 7 described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 195 the signal sequence for interleukin 2 receptor described in Cosman et al. 1984312 768 the interleukin 4 receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0367 566 the type I interleukin 1 receptor signal peptide described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 968 607 the type II interleukin 1 receptor signal peptide described in EP Patent No. 0 460 846.

The expression vectors that are provided may be constructed from a starting vector such as a commercially available vector. Such vectors may or may not contain all of the desired flanking sequences. Where one or more of the flanking sequences described herein are not already present in the vector they may be individually obtained and ligated into the vector. Methods used for obtaining each of the flanking sequences are well known to one skilled in the art.

After the vector has been constructed and a nucleic acid molecule encoding light chain a heavy chain or a light chain and a heavy chain comprising a c fms antigen binding sequence has been inserted into the proper site of the vector the completed vector may be inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification and or polypeptide expression. The transformation of an expression vector for an antigen binding protein into a selected host cell may be accomplished by well known methods including transfection infection calcium phosphate co precipitation electroporation microinjection lipofection DEAE dextran mediated transfection or other known techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the type of host cell to be used. These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the skilled artisan and are set forth for example in Sambrook et al. 2001 supra.

A host cell when cultured under appropriate conditions synthesizes an antigen binding protein that can subsequently be collected from the culture medium if the host cell secretes it into the medium or directly from the host cell producing it if it is not secreted . The selection of an appropriate host cell will depend upon various factors such as desired expression levels polypeptide modifications that are desirable or necessary for activity such as glycosylation or phosphorylation and ease of folding into a biologically active molecule.

Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include but are not limited to immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells HeLa cells baby hamster kidney BHK cells monkey kidney cells COS human hepatocellular carcinoma cells e.g. Hep G2 and a number of other cell lines. In certain embodiments cell lines may be selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and constitutively produce antigen binding proteins with c fms binding properties. In another embodiment a cell line from the B cell lineage that does not make its own antibody but has a capacity to make and secrete a heterologous antibody can be selected.

Antigen binding proteins are useful for detecting c fms in biological samples and identification of cells or tissues that produce c fms. For instance the c fms antigen binding proteins can be used in diagnostic assays e.g. binding assays to detect and or quantify c fms expressed in a tissue or cell. Antigen binding proteins that specifically bind to c fms can also be used in treatment of diseases related to c fms in a patient in need thereof. In addition c fms antigen binding proteins can be used to inhibit c fms from forming a complex with its ligand CSF 1 thereby modulating the biological activity of c fms in a cell or tissue. Examples of activities that can be modulated include but are not limited to inhibiting autophosphorylation of c fms reducing monocyte chemotaxis inhibiting monocyte migration inhibiting the accumulation of tumor associated macrophages in a tumor or diseased tissue and or inhibiting angiogenesis. Antigen binding proteins that bind to c fms thus can modulate and or block interaction with other binding compounds and as such may have therapeutic use in ameliorating diseases related to c fms.

Many tumor cells secrete CSF 1 that in turn attracts promotes the survival of and activates monocyte macrophage cells through the cognate receptor c fms. The level of CSF 1 in human tumors has been shown to correlate positively with the number of TAMs present in those tumors Murdoch et al. 2004104 2224 2234 . Several studies have linked high TAM numbers with reduced patient survival in patients with various forms of cancer. Recent studies have indicated the existence of an autocrine loop in tumor cells. Other research indicates that c fms plays a role in various inflammatory diseases. Therefore regulation of c fms CSF 1 signaling by the human c fms antigen binding proteins provided herein can inhibit interfere with or modulate at least one of the biological responses related to c fms and as such are useful for ameliorating the effects of c fms related diseases or conditions. C fms binding proteins provided herein can also be used for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of such diseases or conditions.

A disease or condition associated with human c fms includes any disease or condition whose onset in a patient is caused by at least in part the interaction of c fms with the CSF 1 ligand and or IL 34. The severity of the disease or condition can also be increased or decreased by the interaction of c fms with CSF 1 and or IL 34. Examples of diseases and conditions that can be treated with the antigen binding proteins include various cancers inflammatory diseases and bone disorders. The antigen binding proteins can also be used to treat or prevent metastasis of cancer and bone osteolysis associated with the metastasis of cancer to bone.

A high level of TAMs is associated with tumor growth in a variety of cancers including breast Tsutsui et al. 200514 425 431 Leek et al. 199979 991 995 Leek and Harris 20027 177 189 prostate Lissbrant et al. 200017 445 451 endometrial Ohno et al. 200424 3335 3342 bladder Hanada et al. 20007 263 269 kidney Hamada et al. 200222 4281 4284 esophageal Lewis and Pollard 200666 2 606 612 squamous cell Koide et al. 200499 1667 1674 uveal melanoma Makitie et al. 200142 1414 1421 follicular lymphoma Farinha et al. 2005106 2169 2174 renal and cervical Kirma et al. 200767 1918 1926 . In the cases of breast cancer prostate cancer endometrial cancer bladder cancer kidney cancer esophageal cancer squamous cell carcinoma uveal melanoma follicular lymphomas and ovarian cancer the high levels of TAMs also indicates reduced patient survival. Therefore the c fms antigen binding proteins provided herein can be used to inhibit recruitment to and decrease survival and function of the TAMs in the tumor thus negatively affecting tumor growth and increasing patient survival.

Other cancers that can be treated include but are not limited to solid tumors generally lung cancer ovarian cancer colorectal cancer brain pancreatic head neck liver leukemia lymphoma and Hodgkin s disease multiple myeloma Farinha et al. 2005106 2169 2174 melanoma gastric cancer astrocytic cancer stomach and pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Ishigami et al. 200323 4079 4083 Caruso et al. 199912 386 390 Witcher et al. 2004104 3335 3342 Haran Ghera et al. 199789 2537 2545 Hussein et al. 2006 87 163 76 Lau et al. 2006 94 1496 1503 Leung et al. 199793 518 527 Giraudo et al. 2004114 623 633 Kirma et al. 200767 1918 26 van Ravenswaay et al. 199267 166 174.

The antigen binding proteins can also be used to inhibit tumor growth progression and or metastasis. Such inhibition can be monitored using various methods. For instance inhibition can result in reduced tumor size and or a decrease in metabolic activity within the tumor. Both of these parameters can be measured by MRI or PET scans for example. Inhibition can also be monitored by biopsy to ascertain the level of necrosis tumor cell death and the level of vascularity within the tumor. The extent of metastasis and bone osteolysis associated with metastasis can be monitored using known methods.

Evidence for the existence of an autocrine loop indicates that inhibition of c fms activity can have an impact on tumor associated macrophages but also on the tumor cells. Thus in one embodiment tumors that have an autocrine loop are targeted as the primary target. In other embodiments both TAMs and the tumor are targeted for a combined effect. In still other embodiments tumors using a paracrine loop or an autocrine and paracrine loop are targeted.

An antigen binding protein as provided herein can also be used in combination with a growth factor inhibitor. Examples of such agents include but are not limited to agents that can inhibit EGF R epidermal growth factor receptor responses such as EGF R antibodies EGF antibodies and molecules that are EGF R inhibitors VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors such as VEGF receptors and molecules that can inhibit VEGF and erbB2 receptor inhibitors such as organic molecules or antibodies that bind to the erbB2 receptor for example HERCEPTIN Genentech Inc. . EGF R inhibitors are described in for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 747 498 WO 98 14451 WO 95 19970 and WO 98 02434.

Specific examples of combination therapies include for instance the c fms antigen binding protein with taxol or taxanes e.g. docetaxel or Taxotere or a modified paclitaxel e.g. Abraxane or Opaxio doxorubicin and or Avastin for the treatment of breast cancer the human c fms antigen binding protein with a multi kinase inhibitor MKI Sutent Nexavar or 706 and or doxorubicin for treatment of kidney cancer the c fms antigen binding protein with cisplatin and or radiation for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma the c fms antigen binding protein with taxol and or carboplatin for the treatment of lung cancer.

In addition to the applications in oncology the binding proteins provided herein can be used in the treatment or detection of inflammatory diseases. In those inflammatory diseases where macrophages contribute to the pathology of disease the ability of the c fms antigen binding protein to reduce levels of macrophages in other cellular compartments indicates a useful role in treating these diseases. Several studies suggest that human c fms antigen binding protein may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory diseases like for example inflammatory arthritis atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis.

Additional diseases that can be treated include but are not limited to inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis rheumatoid spondylitis ankylosing spondylitis arthritis psoriatic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis eczema contact dermatitis psoriasis toxic shock syndrome sepsis septic shock endotoxic shock asthma chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease silicosis pulmonary sarcoidosis osteoporosis restenosis cardiac and renal reperfusion injury thrombosis glomerularonephritis diabetes graft vs. host reaction allograft rejection multiple sclerosis muscle degeneration muscular dystrophy Alzheimer s disease and stroke.

The antigen binding proteins can also be used to treat cachexia because the proinflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages are considered to be involved in cachexia pathology Sweet et al. 2002168 392 399 Boddaert et al. 20068 335 340 and Wang et al. 2006 190 415 423 .

Given the ability of the antigen binding proteins to be used to treat various inflammatory diseases they can be used or combined with various other anti inflammatory agents. Examples of such agents include but are not limited to TNF alpha inhibitors such as TNF drugs e.g. HUMIRA REMICADE and TNF receptor immunoglobulin molecules such as ENBREL IL 1 inhibitors receptor antagonists or soluble IL 1ra e.g. Kineret or ICE inhibitors COX 2 inhibitors and metalloprotease inhibitors such as those described above and alpha 2 delta ligands e.g. PREGABALIN and NEUROTIN .

In certain embodiments antigen binding proteins can also be used to treat various bone diseases in view of the important role of c fms in osteoclast development and activation e.g. Rolf F. et al. 2008 55 340 349 and Watarn A. et al. 2006 24 274 282 . The antigen binding proteins can thus be useful for treating patients suffering from various medical disorders that involve excessive bone loss or patients who require the formation of new bone even where there may not necessarily be excessive osteoclast activity. Excessive osteoclast activity is associated with numerous osteopenic disorders that can be treated with the antigen binding proteins that are provided including ostopenia osteoporosis periodontitis Paget s disease bone loss due to immobilization lytic bone metastases and arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis ankylosing spondylitis and other conditions that involve bone erosion. Some cancers are known to increase osteoclast activity and induce bone resorption such as breast and prostate cancer. Multiple myeloma which arises in bone marrow also is associated with bone loss.

With respect to bone metastases of cancer inhibition of the CSF 1 c fms axis through the use of the antigen binding proteins provided herein could be of therapeutic benefit through multiple mechanisms of action. These would include inhibition of invasion and metastasis through loss of the matrix degrading enzymes produced by TAMs interference with tumor cell seeding within bone marrow through loss of osteoclast numbers and function inhibition of metastatic tumor growth through previously mentioned reduction of TAMs and inhibition of bone osteolysis associated with bone metastatic lesions Ohno H. et al. 2008 Molecular Cancer Therapeutics. 5 2634 2643 . The antigen binding proteins can also have therapeutic benefit for osteosarcoma which is a cancer of the bone.

Various other low bone mass conditions can also be treated including a variety of forms of osteoporosis including but not limited to glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis osteoporosis induced after transplantation osteoporosis associated with chemotherapy i.e. chemotherapy induced osteoporosis immobilization induced osteoporosis osteoporosis due to mechanical unloading and osteoporosis associated with anticonvulsant use. Additional bone diseases that can be treated include bone disease associated with renal failure and nutritional gastrointestinal and or hepatic associated bone diseases.

Different forms of arthritis can also be treated examples including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The antigen binding proteins can also be used to treat systemic bone loss associated with arthritis e.g. rheumatoid arthritis . In treating arthritis patients may benefit by perilesional or intralesional injections of the subject antigen binding proteins. For example the antigen binding protein can be injected adjacent to or directly into an inflamed joint thus stimulating repair of damaged bone at the site.

The antigen binding proteins described herein can also be used in various bone repair applications. For example they can be useful in retarding wear debris osteolysis associated with artificial joints accelerating the repair of bone fractures and enhancing the incorporation of bone grafts into the surrounding living bone into which they have been engrafted.

The antigen binding proteins provided herein when used to treat bone disorders can be administered alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for example in combination with cancer therapy agents with agents that inhibit osteoclast activity or with other agents that enhance osteoblast activity. For example the antigen binding proteins can be administered to cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Chemotherapies used in combination with the antigen binding proteins may include anthracyclines taxol tamoxifene doxorubicin 5 fluorouracil oxaloplatin Velcade 1R 3 methyl 1 2S 1 oxo 3 phenyl 2 pyrazinylcarbonyl amino propyl amino butyl boronic acid and or other small molecule drugs that are used in treating cancer.

The antigen binding proteins can be used alone for the treatment of the above referenced conditions resulting in loss of bone mass or in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a bone growth promoting anabolic agent or a bone anti resorptive agent including but not limited to bone morphogenic factors designated BMP 1 to BMP 12 transforming growth factor and TGF family members fibroblast growth factors FGF 1 to FGF 10 interleukin 1 inhibitors including IL 1ra antibodies to IL 1 and antibodies to IL 1 receptors TNF inhibitors including etanercept adalibumab and infliximab RANK ligand inhibitors including soluble RANK osteoprotegerin and antagonistic antibodies that specifically bind RANK or RANK ligand Dkk 1 inhibitors e.g. anti Dkk 1 antibodies parathyroid hormone E series prostaglandins bisphosphonates and bone enhancing minerals such as fluoride and calcium. Anabolic agents that can be used in combination with the antigen binding proteins and functional fragments thereof include parathyroid hormone and insulin like growth factor IGF wherein the latter agent is preferably complexed with an IGF binding protein. An IL 1 receptor antagonist suitable for such combination treatment is described in WO89 11540 and a suitable soluble TNF receptor 1 is described in WO98 01555. Exemplary RANK ligand antagonists are disclosed for example in WO 03 086289 WO 03 002713 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 740 511 and 6 479 635. All of the aforementioned patents and patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference.

The antigen binding proteins can also be used to inhibit angiogenesis e.g. in tumors . For example the antigen binding proteins can be used to decrease blood vessel formation in cases where inflammatory angiogenesis is driven primarily by FGF 2. In some embodiments the antigen binding proteins are used to inhibit angiogenesis in tumors where VEGF levels are low and tumor vascular density is high.

The antigen binding proteins of the described can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect diagnose or monitor diseases and or conditions associated with c fms. The disclosed provides for the detection of the presence of c fms in a sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art e.g. Tijssen 1993 Vol 15 Eds R. H. Burdon and P. H. van Knippenberg Elsevier Amsterdam Zola 1987 pp. 147 158 CRC Press Inc. Jalkanen et al. 1985101 976 985 Jalkanen et al. 1987105 3087 3096 . The detection of c fms can be performed in vivo or in vitro.

Diagnostic applications provided herein include use of the antigen binding proteins to detect expression of c fms and binding of the ligands to c fms. Examples of methods useful in the detection of the presence of c fms include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA .

For diagnostic applications the antigen binding protein typically will be labeled with a detectable labeling group. Suitable labeling groups include but are not limited to the following radioisotopes or radionuclides e.g. H C N S Y Tc In I I fluorescent groups e.g. FITC rhodamine lanthanide phosphors enzymatic groups e.g. horseradish peroxidase galactosidase luciferase alkaline phosphatase chemiluminescent groups biotinyl groups or predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter e.g. leucine zipper pair sequences binding sites for secondary antibodies metal binding domains epitope tags . In some embodiments the labeling group is coupled to the antigen binding protein via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and may be used.

In another aspect an antigen binding protein can be used to identify a cell or cells that express c fms. In a specific embodiment the antigen binding protein is labeled with a labeling group and the binding of the labeled antigen binding protein to c fms is detected. In a further specific embodiment the binding of the antigen binding protein to c fms detected in vivo. In a further specific embodiment the c fms antigen binding protein is isolated and measured using techniques known in the art. See for example 1988 New York Cold Spring Harbor ed. 1991 and periodic supplements John E. Coligan ed. 1993New York John Wiley Sons.

Another aspect of the disclosed provides for detecting the presence of a test molecule that competes for binding to c fms with the antigen binding proteins provided. An example of one such assay would involve detecting the amount of free antigen binding protein in a solution containing an amount of c fms in the presence or absence of the test molecule. An increase in the amount of free antigen binding protein i.e. the antigen binding protein not bound to c fms would indicate that the test molecule is capable of competing for c fms binding with the antigen binding protein. In one embodiment the antigen binding protein is labeled with a labeling group. Alternatively the test molecule is labeled and the amount of free test molecule is monitored in the presence and absence of an antigen binding protein.

Methods of using the antigen binding proteins are also provided. In some methods an antigen binding protein is provided to a patient. The antigen binding protein inhibits binding of CSF 1 to human c fms. The administration of an antigen binding protein in some methods can also inhibit autophosphorylation of human c fms by inhibiting binding of CSF 1 to human c fms. Further in certain methods monocyte chemotaxis is reduced by administering an effective amount of at least one antigen binding protein to a patient. Monocyte migration into tumors in some methods is inhibited by administering an effective amount of an antigen binding protein. In addition the accumulation of tumor associated macrophage in a tumor or diseased tissue can be inhibited by administering an antigen binding protein as provided herein.

Pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or a plurality of the antigen binding proteins and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent carrier solubilizer emulsifier preservative and or adjuvant are also provided. In addition methods of treating a patient by administering such pharmaceutical composition are included. The term patient includes human patients.

See REMINGTON S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES 18 Edition A. R. Genrmo ed. 1990 Mack Publishing Company.

In certain embodiments the optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon for example the intended route of administration delivery format and desired dosage. See for example REMINGTON S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES supra. In certain embodiments such compositions may influence the physical state stability rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the antigen binding proteins disclosed. In certain embodiments the primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non aqueous in nature. For example a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. In specific embodiments pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0 8.5 or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0 5.5 and may further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute. In certain embodiments human c fms antigen binding protein compositions may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents REMINGTON S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES supra in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further in certain embodiments the human c fms antigen binding protein may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be selected for parenteral delivery. Alternatively the compositions may be selected for inhalation or for delivery through the digestive tract such as orally. Preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.

The formulation components are present preferably in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. In certain embodiments buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.

When parenteral administration is contemplated the therapeutic compositions may be provided in the form of a pyrogen free parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired human c fms antigen binding protein in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which the human c fms antigen binding protein is formulated as a sterile isotonic solution properly preserved. In certain embodiments the preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent such as injectable microspheres bio erodible particles polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid beads or liposomes that may provide controlled or sustained release of the product which can be delivered via depot injection. In certain embodiments hyaluronic acid may also be used having the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. In certain embodiments implantable drug delivery devices may be used to introduce the desired antigen binding protein.

Certain pharmaceutical compositions are formulated for inhalation. In some embodiments human c fms antigen binding proteins are formulated as a dry inhalable powder. In specific embodiments human c fms antigen binding protein inhalation solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In certain embodiments solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration and formulation methods therefore are further described in International Patent Application No. PCT US94 001875 which is incorporated by reference and describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins. Some formulations can be administered orally. Human c fms antigen binding proteins that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. In certain embodiments a capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre systemic degradation is minimized Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the human c fms antigen binding protein. Diluents flavorings low melting point waxes vegetable oils lubricants suspending agents tablet disintegrating agents and binders may also be employed.

Some pharmaceutical compositions comprise an effective quantity of one or a plurality of human c fms antigen binding proteins in a mixture with non toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile water or another appropriate vehicle solutions may be prepared in unit dose form. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to inert diluents such as calcium carbonate sodium carbonate or bicarbonate lactose or calcium phosphate or binding agents such as starch gelatin or acacia or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate stearic acid or talc.

Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art including formulations involving human c fms antigen binding proteins in sustained or controlled delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained or controlled delivery means such as liposome carriers bio erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections are also known to those skilled in the art. See for example International Patent Application No. PCT US93 00829 which is incorporated by reference and describes controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Sustained release preparations may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include polyesters hydrogels polylactides as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 and European Patent Application Publication No. EP 058481 each of which is incorporated by reference copolymers of L glutamic acid and gamma ethyl L glutamate Sidman et al. 19832 547 556 poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate Langer et al. 198115 167 277 and Langer 198212 98 105 ethylene vinyl acetate Langer et al. 1981 supra or poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid European Patent Application Publication No. EP 133 988 .

Pharmaceutical compositions used for in vivo administration are typically provided as sterile preparations. Sterilization can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. When the composition is lyophilized sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. Compositions for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. Parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port for example an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.

In certain embodiments cells expressing a recombinant antigen binding protein as disclosed herein is encapsulated for delivery see Invest. Ophthalmol Vis Sci 43 3292 3298 2002 and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sciences 103 3896 3901 2006 .

In certain formulations an antigen binding protein has a concentration of at least 10 mg ml 20 mg ml 30 mg ml 40 mg ml 50 mg ml 60 mg ml 70 mg ml 80 mg ml 90 mg ml 100 mg ml or 150 mg ml. Some formulations contain a buffer sucrose and polysorbate. An example of a formulation is one containing 50 100 mg ml of antigen binding protein 5 20 mM sodium acetate 5 10 w v sucrose and 0.002 0.008 w v polysorbate. Certain formulations for instance contain 65 75 mg ml of an antigen binding protein in 9 11 mM sodium acetate buffer 8 10 w v sucrose and 0.005 0.006 w v polysorbate. The pH of certain such formulations is in the range of 4.5 6. Other formulations have a pH of 5.0 5.5 e.g. pH of 5.0 5.2 or 5.4 .

Once the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution suspension gel emulsion solid crystal or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready to use form or in a form e.g. lyophilized that is reconstituted prior to administration. Kits for producing a single dose administration unit are also provided. Certain kits contain a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. In certain embodiments kits containing single and multi chambered pre filled syringes e.g. liquid syringes and lyosyringes are provided. The therapeutically effective amount of a human c fms antigen binding protein containing pharmaceutical composition to be employed will depend for example upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will vary depending in part upon the molecule delivered the indication for which the human c fms antigen binding protein is being used the route of administration and the size body weight body surface or organ size and or condition the age and general health of the patient. In certain embodiments the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect.

A typical dosage may range from about 1 g kg to up to about 30 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. In specific embodiments the dosage may range from 10 g kg up to about 30 mg kg optionally from 0.1 mg kg up to about 30 mg kg alternatively from 0.3 mg kg up to about 20 mg kg. In some applications the dosage is from 0.5 mg kg to 20 mg kg. In some instances an antigen binding protein is dosed at 0.3 mg kg 0.5 mg kg 1 mg kg 3 mg kg 10 mg kg or 20 mg kg. The dosage schedule in some treatment regimes is at a dose of 0.3 mg kg qW 0.5 mg kg qW 1 mg kg qW 3 mg kg qW 10 mg kg qW or 20 mg kg qW.

Dosing frequency will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the particular human c fms antigen binding protein in the formulation used. Typically a clinician administers the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose or as two or more doses which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule over time or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose response data. In certain embodiments the antigen binding proteins can be administered to patients throughout an extended time period. Chronic administration of an antigen binding protein minimizes the adverse immune or allergic response commonly associated with antigen binding proteins that are not fully human for example an antibody raised against a human antigen in a non human animal for example a non fully human antibody or non human antibody produced in a non human species.

The route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods e.g. orally through injection by intravenous intraperitoneal intracerebral intra parenchymal intracerebroventricular intramuscular intra ocular intraarterial intraportal or intralesional routes by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. In certain embodiments the compositions may be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion or by implantation device.

The composition also may be administered locally via implantation of a membrane sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. In certain embodiments where an implantation device is used the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ and delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion timed release bolus or continuous administration.

It also may be desirable to use human c fms antigen binding protein pharmaceutical compositions according to the disclosed ex vivo. In such instances cells tissues or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to human c fms antigen binding protein pharmaceutical compositions after which the cells tissues and or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.

In particular human c fms antigen binding proteins can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered using methods such as those described herein to express and secrete the polypeptide. In certain embodiments such cells may be animal or human cells and may be autologous heterologous or xenogeneic. In certain embodiments the cells may be immortalized. In other embodiments in order to decrease the chance of an immunological response the cells may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In further embodiments the encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible semi permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product s but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient s immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.

The following examples including the experiments conducted and the results achieved are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the appended claims.

In order to determine whether antibodies directed against c fms can bind and exhibit functional activity in blocking the c fms CSF 1 axis a cell based bioassay was used. This assay quantitatively measures CSF 1 driven proliferation of a growth factor dependent human myelomonocytic cell line AML5 University Health Network Toronto Ontario . The assay therefore measures the inhibition of this proliferation by introducing agents that block this pathway. In this assay AML 5 cells were incubated with 10 ng ml CSF 1 in the presence of decreasing concentrations of antibody. After 72 hours cell proliferation was measured using Alamar Blue Biosource an indirect measure of proliferation based on metabolic activity of the cells.

In a similar assay to determine whether the antibodies could cross react with cynomolgus monkey c fms antibodies were tested in CSF 1 driven proliferation of the monocytic cells from primary monkey bone marrow. Similar to the AML 5 proliferation assay cynomolgus bone marrow cells were incubated with 10 ng ml CSF 1 in the presence of decreasing concentrations of antibody. After 72 hours cell proliferation was measured using Alamar Blue.

The following experiments include the use of three antibody clones designated as 1.109 1.2 2.360 which all are tetramers including two complete heavy and two complete light chains. Clone 1.109 comprises two heavy chains H1 SEQ ID NO 4 and two light chains L1 SEQ ID NO 36 clone 1.2 comprises two heavy chains H8 SEQ ID NO 11 and two light chains L8 SEQ ID NO 43 and clone 2.360 comprises two heavy chains H24 SEQ ID NO 27 and two light chains L22 SEQ ID NO 57 .

Embodiments may employ the XenoMouse technology to develop fully human monoclonal antibodies directed against human c fms. For immunization purposes the c fms Fc a human c fms extracellular domain residues 1 512 see SEQ ID 1 with a C terminal human Fc domain was employed. In addition c fms LZ a human c fms extracellular domain residues 1 512 with a C terminal leucine zipper domain Amgen Lot 45640 43 and 293T c fms cell line a human adenovirus type 5 transformed human embryonic kidney cell line transfected with full length human c fms were utilized to screen the anti c fms antibodies.

Cohort 1 IgG and cohort 2 IgG XenoMice were immunized boosted with c fms Fc. Serum titers were measured by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA and spleens from both cohorts 1 and 2 mice were fused to generate hybridomas. The resulting polyclonal supernatants were screened for binding to c fms LZ by ELISA and 293T c fms cells by fluorometric microvolume assay technology FMAT . A total of 828 positive supernatants were tested for inhibition of CSF 1 binding to the c fms 293T cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS . The resulting 168 positive supernatants were further tested for inhibition of CSF 1 induced proliferation of acute myelogenous leukemia AML 5 cells. Based on the screening 33 hybridomas were identified as antagonistic to CSF 1 activity and were selected for cloning.

From the 33 selected hybridomas 29 19 IgG1 and 10 IgG2 isotypes were successfully cloned and supernatants from these clones were tested for inhibition of CSF 1 binding to the 293T c fms cells and inhibition of CSF 1 induced proliferation of AML 5 cells. A low resolution Biacore binding assay using monomeric c fms protein indicated that the Kof these 29 anti c fms hybridomas was in the range of 0.1 43 nM see TABLE 8 . Anti human IgG was immobilized on all four flow cells of a sensor chip using amine coupling. Crude hybridoma samples were diluted into halves and captured on the anti IgG surface. Monomeric c fms residues 1 512 pHis was the analyte at a concentration of 125 nM. Sequence lineage analyses were also performed on the 29 hybridomas see .

Based on the binding inhibition and proliferation inhibition assays 16 of the 29 supernatants eleven IgG1 and five IgG2 isotypes were selected for further characterization. Cross reactivity to mouse and cynomolgus c fms was tested by inhibition of CSF 1 induced proliferation of mouse DRM a ras and myc immortalized monocytic cell line derived from Dexter type culture of mouse bone marrow cells and primary cynomolgus bone marrow cells respectively. With respect to cell proliferation none of the supernatants inhibited the proliferation of the mouse DRM cells data not shown while 13 of 16 supernatants inhibited proliferation of the cynomolgus bone marrow cells. The supernatants were also tested for inhibition of CSF 1 induced proliferation of human peripheral blood derived CD14 monocytes and retested in the human AML 5 bioassay see Assay section above the results of which are shown in TABLES 9 and 10. The 2 4A5 antibody Biosource which is a rat anti human c fms antibody was used as a positive control.

Heavy and light chain genes for antibody clones 1.2 1.109 and 2.360 were isolated and cloned into constructs for expression as IgGheavy chains and kappa light chains. Antibodies were expressed by transient expression in COS PKB cells and purified by Protein A chromatography. Antibody yields were 3.6 7.4 mg l which is within the expected range for this expression system.

The activities of the cloned antibodies and the hybridoma expressed antibodies were compared in the AML 5 proliferation assay. AML 5 cells were incubated with 10 ng ml CSF 1 in the presence of decreasing concentrations of antibody. After 72 hours cell proliferation was measured using Alamar Blue see . The recombinant antibodies showed similar neutralizing activity as the hybridoma supernatants and conversion of 1.2 and 1.109 from IgG1 to IgG2 had no apparent effect. The recombinant antibodies also demonstrated good neutralizing activity in the cynomolgus proliferation assay as shown in . Similar to the AML 5 proliferation assay cynomolgus bone marrow cells were incubated with 10 ng ml CSF 1 in the presence of decreasing concentrations of antibody. After 72 hours cell proliferation was measured using Alamar Blue.

Characterization of the purified antibodies by SDS PAGE and size exclusion chromatography SEC produced typical results with the exception of the clone 1.109 light chain which migrated larger than expected on SDS PAGE. This exception was not unexpected because an N linked glycosylation site sequence was previously noted in CDR1. The larger than expected migration suggested that this glycosylation site was occupied.

N terminal sequencing of the antibodies confirmed that signal peptides were processed as expected and that the heavy chain N terminal glutamine residues were likely cyclized to pyroglutamic acid as would be expected. Mass spectrometry was performed on the individual antibody chains following enzymatic deglycosylation. The masses of the heavy chains confirmed that the N terminal glutamine residues were cyclized to pyroglutamic acid and that the C terminal lysine residues were absent. No other post translational modifications were noted. The masses of the clone 1.2 SM and 2.360 light chains confirmed that they were intact with no post translational modifications. A mass was not obtained for the clone 1.109 light chain probably because the glycosylation site was resistant to enzymatic removal and thus an accurate mass could not be obtained.

Sequence comparison of IgG2 clone 1.2 1.109 and 2.360 antibodies to known germline sequences revealed the following somatic mutations as shown in TABLE 11 with the numbering in the table being with respect to the mature sequence as shown in .

To test if the somatic mutations could be converted to germline residues the relevant constructs were generated and antibodies were expressed by transient expression in COS PKB cells and purified by Protein A chromatography. These antibodies were designated IgGclone 1.2 SM 1.109 SM and 2.360 SM SM somatic mutation cured . For the 1.109 LC two constructs were made. In the first construct Asn 28 was converted to Asp 28 to eliminate the N linked glycosylation site and in the second construct Asn 28 was converted to Asp 28 and Asn 45 was converted to Lys 45. Yields were 1.7 4.5 mg l which is within the expected range for this expression system.

Characterization of the purified antibodies by SDS PAGE and size exclusion chromatography SEC produced typical results. SDS PAGE of the two forms of IgGclone 1.109 SM showed that the light chain migrated faster than the parent antibody light chain confirming that the N linked glycosylation site was eliminated. N terminal sequencing showed that the N termini of the antibody chains were intact and mass spectrometry showed that the somatic mutations had been converted to germline residues.

Following the correction of the somatic mutations the purified IgGantibodies were retested in the AML 5 and cynomolgus bone marrow proliferation assays. The ICin the AML 5 proliferation assay did not change for IgGclone 1.2 SM or 1.109 SM SM somatic mutation cured relative to the parent IgGantibodies but there was a 10 fold loss in potency for the IgGclone 2.360 SM antibody see TABLE 12 .

The binding affinities of the somatic mutation corrected antibodies to monomeric c fms protein were measured by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 3000 instrument. The affinity of IgGclone 1.2 SM antibody was essentially unchanged from the parent antibodies whereas the affinities of the IgGclone 1.109 SM and 2.360 SM antibodies were 2 fold less than the respective parent antibodies see TABLE 12 .

The parent PT and SM IgGantibodies were further tested for the ability to inhibit binding of I hCSF 1 to AML 5 cells. The apparent binding affinity of I hCSF 1 to AML 5 cells was first determined to be 46 pM and the Kof unlabeled hCSF 1 was 17.8 pM see Example 10 . As shown in Table 12 the Kvalue for antibody 1.2 was in line with the ICvalue in the AML 5 bioassay and 1.2 SM gave similar results. The Kvalue for antibody 1.109 was also in line with the ICvalue and there was no change with the 1.109 SM antibody despite a 2 fold loss in affinity for monomeric c fms as measured by Biacore. Antibody 2.360 did not inhibit as well as antibodies 1.2 and 1.109 and 2.360 SM inhibited less well than the parent antibody.

The activity of the 1.2 SM antibody was further investigated in proliferation assays using human or Cynomologous bone marrow monocytic cells. For the human assay human cells were incubated with 11.1 ng ml recombinant human CSF 1 in the presence of decreasing concentrations of antibody 1.2 SM. For the cynomolgus assay cynomolgus cells were incubated with 29.63 ng ml recombinant human CSF 1 in the presence of decreasing concentrations of antibody 1.2 SM. Human IgG2 antibody was used in control experiments. After 7 days cell proliferation was measured using CellTiter Glo Promega Madison Wis. to determine levels of ATP. Nonlinear regression curve fit was performed to determine the IC50 of the antibody. TABLE 13 shows the results of three sets of experiments.

To show that anti c fms IgGmAbs 1.109 1.2 and 2.360 are capable of complete or nearly complete inhibition of phosphotyrosine pTyr response 293T c fms cells were treated with these mAbs for 1 hour at various concentrations at 37 C. prior to CSF 1 stimulation.

Various concentrations of the IgGmAbs using titration dilutions were at 1.0 0.1 0.01 0.001 and 0.0001 g ml. As controls a non blocking anti c fms monoclonal antibody mAb 3 4A4 BioSource Intl. and a non relevant antibody hCD39 M105 each at 1.0 g ml were used. Serum starved 293T c fms cells were treated with each of the IgG PT mAbs using the various concentrations as mentioned above and each concentration varying in a ten fold dilution prior to a five minute CSF 1 stimulation at 50 ng ml for 5 minutes. Following stimulation whole cell lysates were collected immunoprecipitated at 4 C. overnight with an anti c fms C20 polyclonal antibody Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. and examined by Western blotting wherein the blot was immunoprobed with a generic anti pTyr antibody 4G10 Upstate Biotechnology and an anti c fms C20 antibody for the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of c fms and c fms itself respectively.

To grow the 293T c fms cells on 24 10 cm dishes at 37 C. in 5 CO eleven T175 flasks 50 60 confluent were collected via 4 ml trypsin flask Gibco Invitrogen and transferred to 70 ml DMEM Gibco 10 FBS JRH Biosciences . Each 10 cm dish was then given 10 ml medium and inoculated with 2 ml of the collected cells. DMEM FBS medium was prepared for 1 hour at 37 C. Culture medium from 10 cm dishes was removed via careful aspiration removing as much FBS containing medium as possible. Ten ml DMEM FBS was added and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37 C.

After serum starvation for 1 hr at 37 C. the medium was removed. Antibody treatments and minus Ab controls were set up with either 4.0 ml of the serially diluted Ab containing samples or DMEM FBS alone and further incubated for another 1 hour at 37 C. to provide a total of 2 hours of serum starvation. The antibody pre treatment and ligand stimulation is illustrated in TABLE 14.

A fresh vial of CSF 1 R D Systems 216 MC Lot CC093091 at 50 ng l 25 g vial was reconstituted in 500 l PBS Gibco 0.1 BSA Sigma and kept on ice. A 1 1000 dilution of CSF 1 stock 60 l was prepared into DMEM FBS 60 ml approximately 5 minutes prior to the end of Ab treatment. The 293T c fms cells were incubated with 50 ng ml of CSF 1 for 5 minutes at 37 C. The supernatants were removed and 2 ml of cold lysis buffer 100 ml PBS 1 Triton 100 l 0.5 M EDTA 100 l 1.0 M NaF 200 l 0.5 M beta glycerol phosphate 500 L sodium vanadate 100 10.0 L okadaic acid 10 000 and 4 tablets of Complete Protease Inhibitor was added. The lysates 2.0 ml were combined with 30 l 50 Protein A G Sepharose Amersham and incubated for 1 hour at 4 C. on a rocker platform to pre clear non specific binding proteins. After spinning the fractions the supernatants were decanted onto fresh 15 ml tubes.

Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2.5 g ml of anti c fms C20 25 l at 0.2 g l . The antibody cell lysate mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 C. on the rocker platform to probe for total c fms. Donkey anti rabbit IgG HRP 1 10 000 in blocking solution Jackson was added and further incubated for another 30 min at 4 C. The immunocomplexes were run on SDS PAGE and immunoblotted. The Western blots were probed with either anti pTyr 4G10 or anti c fms C20 for the detection of pTyr c fms and total c fms respectively.

As shown in IgGclones PT 1.109 1.2 and 2.360 exhibited the ability to inhibit ligand induced pTyr c fms in the 293T3 c fms assay system. Treatment with 0.1 mg ml 8.3 nM of IgGclone PT 1.109 or 1.2 for 1 hour prior to CSF 1 stimulation reduced the phosphotyrosine signal to background levels. On the other hand IgGclone PT 2.360 produced equal inhibition at 1.0 g ml 83 nM . However treatment of either antibodies at 0.01 mg ml 0.83 nM or less did not result in pTyr inhibition. In contrast non blocking anti c fms 3 4A4 and a non relevant hCD39 M105 antibody at the highest dose 1.0 mg ml had no effect on ligand induced pTyr signal compared to the mAb CSF 1 control. Thus the inhibition of pTyr formation is directly linked to the blocking of CSF 1 binding.

Assuming that the 293T c fms transfectants used in these assays retained the previously measured cell surface c fms density of 30 000 receptors cell 3 million cells would bear 90 10c fms significantly less than the 5.0 10mAb in 4.0 ml pretreatment at 0.1 mg ml. mAb present at 10 000 fold excess with respect to target makes saturation of available c fms likely. This indicates that 8.3 nM clone PT 1.109 or 1.2 effectively blocked signaling of CSF 1 at 50 ng ml or 1.0 nM or an approximate 10 1 mAb c fms molar ratio. The threshold of effectiveness for clones PT 1.109 and 1.2 likely falls between 0.1 and 0.01 mg ml 0.83 8.3 nM in this assay system.

Treatment with 1.0 g ml IgG PT mAbs in the absence of CSF 1 addition gave no pTyr signal above background levels. Previous experiments with all three IgG PT forms used at 10 mg ml also revealed no pTyr signal under the same conditions. There was no measured agonistic activity associated with these mAbs.

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is any functional changes in the germline reverted SM forms of IgGclones 1.109 1.2 and 2.360 as compared with their respective parent forms PT . To prepare the 293T c fms cells for this experiment cells growing from five T175 80 90 confluent were collected via 4 ml trypsin flask and transferred to 75 ml DMEM with 10 FBS. To each 24 10 cm dish 9 ml medium was added and inoculated with 3 ml of the collected cells. DMEM FBS medium was prepared and or warmed for 1 hour at 37 C. Culture medium was removed from 10 cm dishes via careful aspiration to remove as much FBS containing medium as possible. DMEM FBS 10 ml was added and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Cold lysis buffer was prepared and kept on ice.

A series of serial antibody dilutions 300 L 2.7 ml DMEM FBS were tested within the range of 1.0 g ml to 0.1 g ml for each mAb. After 1 hour of serum starvation at 37 C. the medium was removed and antibody pre treatments and minus Ab controls were prepared similarly as described in Table 13. The antibody pretreatments and ligand stimulation is described in TABLE 16 hereinbelow 

Ligand induced pTyr by anti c fms mAbs SM forms was performed as described in Example 6 for the PT forms.

Experiments using the 293T c fms cells to compare the effects of PT versus SM forms of the three IgGmAbs at 1.0 and 0.1 g ml revealed no differences in the ability to inhibit ligand induced pTyr C fms see . Clones 1.109 and 1.2 both PT and SM forms showed inhibition at lower concentrations than with the 2.360 PT and SM forms .

Clones 1.109 and 1.2 PT or SM were able to prevent ligand induced pTyr c fms in vitro when 293T c fms cells were treated with 0.1 g ml 8.3 nM or greater mAb for 1 hour at 37 C. prior to the addition of CSF 1 at 50 ng ml 1.0 nM . The ability of these monoclonal antibodies to block the formation of pTyr c fms would lead to the inhibition of CSF 1 signaling monocyte migration and subsequently accumulation of TAMs. No agonistic activity appeared to be associated with these mAbs to avoid activating the receptor in a non CSF 1 dependent manner. The mAbs showed no agonistic activity when used at a concentration of 1.0 g ml and as high as 10 g ml data not shown .

The ability of the IgGanti c fms mAbs to bind and immunoprecipitate c fms was achieved by using the stably transfected 293T c fms cells as described above. Whole cell lysates of unstimulated cells were immunoprecipitated overnight with each mAb PT and SM and anti c fms C20 antibody and examined via Western blot with C20 Ab Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. as the probe for detection of c fms. C fms was immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies. Lysates of stably transfected 293T c fms grown at 37 C. 5 COto 75 confluency were prepared and combined with the monoclonal antibodies as shown in TABLE 17.

Immunoprecipitation experiments using untreated whole cell lysates of stable 293T c fms demonstrated comparable ability of the various mAbs except 2.360 SM to bind and precipitate c fms in comparison to the polyclonal anti c fms C20 control clone 2.360 SM however exhibited a reduced capacity in this assay see .

Single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs are DNA sequence variations that occur when a single nucleotide A G T or C in the genomic sequence has been changed. SNPs may occur in both the coding and non coding regions of the human genome. Many SNPs have no impact on cell function but scientists consider other SNPs could predispose people to disease or have an effect in their drug response. Variations in DNA sequence can have a major influence on how a person responds to a disease environmental insults e.g. bacteria viruses toxins and chemicals drugs and other therapies. For this reason SNPs are of great value to biomedical research pharmaceutical product development and medical diagnosis. Furthermore SNP maps will enable the scientist in the identification of multiple genes that are associated with complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and vascular diseases.

The extracellular region of human c fms can be divided into five immunoglobulin Ig like repeated domains designated A through E . See for example Hampe A. et al. 1989 Oncogene Res. 4 9 17 for a discussion of the human domains. See for example Wang et al. 1993 Molecular and Cell Biology 13 5348 5359 for the corresponding domains in the mouse protein. Domains A C had been shown to comprise the CSF 1 binding region while domain D had been shown to help regulate receptor dimerization upon binding of ligand. Three naturally occurring SNP variants of human c fms were prepared namely A245S V279M in Ig Domain C and H362R in Ig Domain D see for amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain of c fms . These SNPs are found either in or near the CSF 1 binding region and examination by Western blots probed with anti c fms H 300 a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 11 310 mapping near the N terminus of human c fms CSF 1R Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc. Cat. No. sc 13949 .

To study how human c fms SNP variants interact with the various c fms Abs provided herein transiently transfected 293T cells expressing the three types of c fms SNP variants as discussed above and wildtype WT c fms as well as an irrelevant vector matched control were used to assess the ability of each anti c fms mAb to bind SNP variants via immunoprecipitation.

293T cells were transfected in duplicate 10 cm dishes with c fms A245S V279M H362R WT c fms and an irrelevant control construct in the mammalian expression vector pCIneo and grown for 48 hours at 37 C. 5 CO. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. Anti c fms mAbs and polyclonal anti c fms C20 or anti c kit C19 at 2.5 g ml in 1.0 ml aliquots were added to each lysate as illustrated in TABLE 18.

The antibodies revealed no loss of ability to bind the SNP forms compared to WT control . The mAbs appear to have the capability of binding to the range of naturally occurring c fms variants.

Immunoprecipitation from untreated whole cell lysates of stable 293T c fms demonstrated equal ability of all of the various mAbs except 2.360 SM to bind and precipitate c fms compared to polyclonal anti c fms control clone 2.360 SM exhibited a clearly reduced capacity in this assay. Examination of the ability of the various mAbs to immunoprecipitate c fms and SNP variants from transiently transfected 293T c fms cells revealed no loss of ability to bind the SNP forms. The ability of the various mAbs to bind the c fms SNPs indicated that they recognize c fms proteins across the spectrum of variants known to exist for humans.

The affinity of anti c fms mAbs to cell surface expressed human c fms was determined by measuring inhibition of I hCSF 1 binding to AML 5 cells.

Recombinant hCSF 1 Amgen was iodinated using I Amersham and IODO GEN Pierce . Seventy five l PBS 10 g hCSF 1 and 1 mCi I were added to an IODO GEN pre coated iodination tube and left on ice for 15 minutes. The mixture was transferred to an equilibrated 2 ml P6 column where I hCSF 1 was separated from free I by gel filtration. Fractions containing iodinated hCSF 1 were pooled then diluted to a concentration of 100 nM in binding media RPMI 1640 with 2.5 bovine albumin Fraction V 20 mM Hepes and 0.2 sodium azide pH 7.2 . A specific activity of 4.8 10cpm mmol was calculated based on the initial protein concentration of hCSF 1 and a recovery of 80 from a control experiment in which an aliquot of I hCSF 1 was put through the iodination protocol with omission of additional I.

A saturation radioligand binding experiment was performed in conjunction with each inhibition assay in order to determine both a Kand Kfor hCSF 1 binding to c fms expressed on the surface of AML 5 cells. Mixtures were set up in 96 well round bottom microtiter plates with total volumes of 150 l well. All reagents were diluted in binding media containing 0.2 sodium azide and experiments were conducted at 4 C. to minimize potential receptor internalization and shedding.

For the saturation binding assay I hCSF 1 was serially diluted 2 fold starting at a concentration of 1.7 nM and going out 12 wells to a concentration of 1.5 pM. Nonspecific binding was measured at a single concentration of I hCSF 1 80 pM in triplicate in the presence of a 1 000 fold molar excess of unlabeled hCSF 1 and assumed to be a linear function of the concentration of radiolabeled hCSF 1 present.

For the I hCSF 1 inhibition assay unlabeled hCSF 1 was set up at a starting concentration of 5 nM. Starting concentrations for anti c fms 1.2 1.109 and 2.360 PT and SM for each were 0.312 nM 1.25 nM and 20 nM respectively. Each sample was serially diluted 2 fold out 15 wells. Triplicate wells of binding media alone and triplicate wells of 1 000 fold molar excess unlabeled hCSF 1 were set up at the beginning middle and end of the assay as controls to determine percent inhibition. A single concentration of I hCSF 1 9 pM was added to each well.

AML 5 cells were washed twice with PBS and added to each assay plate at 1 10cells well just prior to incubation.

Both assays were incubated at 4 C. on a miniorbital shaker for 4 hours the length of time needed to reach equilibrium as determined in time course experiments. Two 60 l aliquots of each incubation mixture were transferred to chilled 400 l polyethylene centrifuge tubes containing 200 l phthalate oil and spun for 1.5 minutes in a 4 C. tabletop microfuge Sorvall at 9615 g to separate cell associated I hCSF 1 from free I hCSF 1. The oil tubes were cut and each cell pellet and supernatant collected in individual 12 75 mm glass tubes and loaded on a COBRA gamma counter Packard Instrument Company for cpm measurements. Cpm from duplicate aliquots taken from each well were averaged for analysis.

Saturation binding data were fit to a simple 1 site binding equation via nonlinear regression in Prism version 3.03 GraphPad Software Inc. to obtain an apparent mean Kof 46 pM for I hCSF 1 binding to cell surface expressed human c fms. Inhibition data were fit to a single site competitive inhibition equation via nonlinear regression in Prism using the Kvalue for I hCSF 1 obtained in the concurrent binding assay to generate a Kvalue for unlabeled hCSF 1 apparent mean K 17.8 pM as well as for each anti c fms mAb. Mean Kvalues from 2 experiments were reported see TABLE 13 .

The affinity of human c fms 1 512 .pHIS Amgen for the anti c fms mAbs was measured by Biacore. Experiments were conducted at 25 C. using a Biacore 3000 instrument Biacore AB equipped with a CM4 sensor chip. Sensor chips amine coupling reagents EDC 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride NHS N hydroxysuccinimide and ethanolamine HCl pH 8.5 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 HBS EP 0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4 0.15 M NaCl 3 mM EDTA 0.005 v v Surfactant P20 and 10 mM glycine HCl pH 1.5 were purchased from Biacore AB. Bovine serum albumin BSA Bovuminar Standard Powder was purchased from Serological Corporation. AffiniPure Goat Anti Human IgG Fc Fragment Specific was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.

An anti human IgG Fc specific capture antibody was covalently immobilized to a CM4 chip using standard amine coupling chemistry with HBS EP as the running buffer. Briefly each flow cell was activated for 7 minutes with a 1 1 v v mixture of 0.1 M NHS and 0.4 M EDC at a flow rate of 5 l min. Goat anti human IgG at 28 g ml in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 was immobilized at a density of 2700 RUs. Residual reactive surfaces were deactivated with a 7 minute injection of 1 M ethanolamine at 5 l min. Three 50 l injections of 10 mM glycine HCl pH 1.5 at 100 l min were used to remove any remaining noncovalently bound capture antibody and to condition each surface. The running buffer was switched to HBS EP with 0.1 mg ml BSA for all remaining steps.

Anti c fms 1.2 or 1.2 SM at 0.25 g ml was injected over goat anti human IgG Fc in one flow cell for 2 minutes at 10 l min to obtain a surface density of 47 RUs. Another flow cell with goat anti human IgG Fc alone was used as a reference surface. Each assay started with ten cycles of buffer as the analyte to stabilize the signal. Human monomeric c fms 1 512 .pHIS samples were prepared at concentrations of 30 10 3.33 1.11 0.37 and 0.12 nM in triplicate and injected along with 6 buffer blanks in random order at 100 l min over both the captured anti c fms and reference surfaces. Each complex was allowed to associate for 2 minutes and dissociate for 5 minutes. The surfaces were regenerated after each c fms or buffer injection with a 30 second pulse of 10 mM glycine HCl pH 1.5 at 100 l min followed by a 30 second injection of buffer.

Other anti c fms antibodies were tested in a similar manner but changes were made to the protocol to account for differences in binding characteristics. Anti c fms 1.109 and 1.109 SM were each injected over goat anti human IgG at 0.5 g ml for 1.5 minutes at 10 L min to obtain surface densities of 59 and 91 RUs respectively. Human c fms 1 512 .pHIS samples were prepared at concentrations of 10 3.33 1.11 0.37 0.12 and 0.041 nM for anti c fms 1.109 binding and the same set with the exception of the 0.041 nM sample was prepared for anti c fms 1.109 SM binding. Human monomeric c fms 1 512 .pHIS was allowed to dissociate from anti c fms 1.109 for 20 mins and 1.109 SM for 15 mins. Anti c fms 2.360 and 2.360 SM were each injected over goat anti human IgG Fc at 1 g ml for 1.5 or 2 minutes respectively at 10 l min to obtain surface densities of 100 RUs. Human c fms 1 512 pHIS samples were prepared at concentrations of 30 10 3.33 1.11 and 0.37 nM for anti c fms 2.360 binding and the same set with the addition of a 0.12 nM sample was prepared for anti c fms 2.360 SM binding. Human monomeric c fms 1 512 .pHIS was allowed to dissociate from anti c fms 2.360 for 8 mins and 2.360 SM for 5 mins.

Data was double referenced by subtracting the reference surface responses to remove bulk refractive index changes and then subtracting the averaged buffer blank response to remove systematic artifacts from the experimental flow cells. The data was processed and globally fit to a 1 1 interaction model with local Rmax in BIAevaluation version 4.1 Biacore AB to obtain kinetic rate constants kand k. Though data from triplicate samples at each concentration of c fms was collected only data from duplicate samples could be analyzed due to the parameter number restrictions inherent to BIAevaluation software. The Kwas calculated from the quotient k k. The results are shown in TABLE 19. Data from the various examples provided above are summarized in Table 20.

The c fms avidin fusion expression constructs are shown in . To express each fusion protein the coding sequence for human c fms extracellular domain was PCR amplified and cloned into pCEP4 Avidin N such that the c fms sequence was joined to the C terminus of the chicken avidin sequence using the restriction enzyme XhoI. The signal sequence of c fms was not included as the signal sequence for chicken avidin was left intact in the pCEP4 avidin N vector.

As noted above the extracellular domain contains five different Ig like regions. The different domains in human c fms are discussed for example in Hampe et al. 19894 9 17. For a discussion of the corresponding domains in mouse c fms see for example Wang et al. 199313 5348 5359. The following different avidin constructs were prepared to correspond with the indicated Ig like domain see for the amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain SEQ ID No 1 .

Thus to create specific regions of human c fms truncations for epitope mapping PCR amplification was performed to target the following amino acids Ig like loop1 IPVI ALLP Ig like loops 1 and 2 IPVI AQIV Ig like loops 1 3 IPVI EGLN Ig like loops 1 4 IPVI GTLL and Ig like loops 1 5 IPVI PPDE as well as Ig like loop 2 alone TEPG AQIV . The sequences identified in the parentheses indicate the starting and ending sequence respectively for each of the domains see . The particular regions indicated were selected to keep the cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation as these bonds are important in maintaining the native three dimensional structure of the domains. Furthermore the construct for the Ig like loop 2 alone includes some sequence from the Ig like loop 1 for the same reason. Consequently the starting and ending amino acids of the domains that are listed differ somewhat from the domain regions specified in the articles by Hampe and Wang listed above.

Expression of avidin fusion proteins was achieved by transient transfection of human 293T adherent cells in T75 tissue culture flasks. Cells were grown and maintained in DMEM high glucose with 10 dialyzed FBS and 1 Pen strep glutamine growth medium at 37 C. and 5 CO. Approximately 3 10293T cells were inoculated into T75 flasks containing 15 ml of growth medium and grown overnight for approximately 20 hours. Cells were then transfected with pCEP4 Avidin N c fms constructs. In each flask 15 g of DNA was mixed with 75 l of Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen in the presence of Opti MEM medium Invitrogen and the complex was incubated for 20 minutes. The transfection complex was inoculated into the corresponding flask and incubated at 37 C. for 4 5 hours in Opti MEM media. At the end of the incubation time the Opti MEM medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. Approximately 48 hours post transfection the conditioned media was harvested and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. to remove cells and debris and transferred to 50 ml tubes. A control flask was also made following the same protocol but no DNA was used mock transfection yielding negative control conditioned media for binding experiments.

The concentration of each c fms avidin fusion protein was determined using a quantitative FACS based assay. The c fms avidin fusion proteins were captured on 6.7 m biotin polystyrene beads Spherotech Inc. Libertyville Ill. . 1 conditioned media 20 and 200 l were added to 5 l 3.5 10 beads and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with rotation. Conditioned media was removed by centrifugation and samples were washed with PBS containing 0.5 BSA BPBS . The avidin beads were stained with 200 l of a 0.5 mg ml solution of a goat FITC labeled anti avidin antibody Vector Labs Burlingame Calif. in BPBS for 45 minutes at room temperature covered by foil. Following incubation the beads were recollected by centrifugation washed with BPBS and resuspended for analysis in 0.5 ml BPBS. The FITC fluorescence was detected using a FACScan Becton Dickinson Bioscience Franklin Lakes N.J. . The signal was converted to protein mass using a standard curve derived with rAvidin. For epitope mapping biotin beads were loaded with 100 ng of c fms avidin fusion protein per 3.5 10beads and brought up to volume with growth medium.

Biotin coated polystyrene beads Spherotech Inc. loaded with normalized amounts of C FMS subdomain fusion proteins were mixed with 1 mg of FITC conjugated anti c fms monoclonal antibody 1.109 1.2 and 2.36 in 0.2 ml of BPBS. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature 3 ml washing buffer BPBS was added and the antibody beads complexes were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 750 g. The pellet was washed in 3 ml of BPBS. The antibody bound to avidin bead complexes was detected by FACS Becton Dickinson analysis. The mean X fluorescent intensity was recorded for each sample.

To prepare for labeling with fluorescein the monoclonal antibodies were dialyzed or resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg ml in PBS pH 7.4 . Label 6 fluorescein 5 and 6 carboxamido hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester 5 6 SFX mixed isomers from Molecular Probes F 2181 was added to the protein at a molar ratio 9.5 1 label protein from a label stock of 5 mg ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour in the dark. The labeled antibody was separated from the free label by dialysis in PBS. For each competition experiment a binding reaction was assembled that contained a 20 fold excess 20 g ml of unlabeled competitor antibody 3.5 10biotin beads coated with the avidin fusion protein in BPBS. The FITC labeled antibody 1 g ml was added after a 30 min pre incubation of unlabeled competitor antibody. The process followed the one color method from this point forward.

All the fusion proteins expressed in 293T cells can be detected with FITC labeled anti avidin antibody by FACScan. To determine which c fms Ig like domain is the antibody binding site all six fusion proteins were used in a binding assay. The antibody clones 1.109 1.2 and 2.36 bind to the human c fms subdomain Ig like1 2 Ig like1 3 Ig like1 4 and Ig like1 5 fusion proteins. They do not bind to the single domain c fms Ig like1 and Ig like2 fusion proteins. For comparison human c fms ECD is used as a positive control . These results indicate that the epitopes of these three antibodies are mainly located at the N terminus Ig like loop1 and Ig like loop2 of human c fms and require the presence of both the Ig like loop 1 and the Ig like loop 2 regions. The results also indicate that the antibody may not directly block the high affinity binding site of the ligand which is mainly located at Ig like loop3. It may indirectly affect the ligand binding due to Ig like loops 1 and 2 both of which are critical regions for ligand binding Wang et al. 199313 5348 5359 .

Among the three antibodies clone 1.109 has the highest binding signal compared to the other two antibodies under 1 g ml. The competition data demonstrated that three of the antibodies can block each other with 20 fold excess unlabeled antibody see and . The competition data also indicate that the epitope of these three antibodies are similar or adjacent within Ig like loops 1 and 2.

This experiment was conducted to determine if certain of the human antibodies disclosed herein bound the same or a different epitope than a number of commercially available antibodies.

Human c fms avidin fusion expression constructs were prepared as described in Example 12. Expression of avidin fusion proteins was achieved by transient transfection of human 293T adherent cells in 10 cm tissue culture plates. Cells were grown and maintained in DMEM high glucose containing 5 qualified FBS and supplemented with 1 Pen strep glutamine Invitrogen 1 non essential amino acids Invitrogen and 1 sodium pyruvate Invitrogen growth medium at 37 C. and 5 CO. Approximately 2.5 10293T cells were inoculated into 10 cm plates containing 10 ml of growth medium and grown overnight for approximately 20 hours. Cells were then transfected with pCEP4 Avidin N c fms constructs. For each transfection 7.5 g of DNA was mixed with 45 l of FuGene6 Roche in the presence of supplement free DMEM medium Invitrogen and the complex was incubated for 20 minutes. The transfection complex was added to the corresponding plate and incubated at 37 C. overnight. The following morning the cells were washed twice with 1 Dulbecco s Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS Invitrogen and fed with 5 ml of serum free DMEM containing the aforementioned supplements plus Insulin Transferrin Selenium X ITS X Invitrogen . Approximately 48 hours post transfection the conditioned media was harvested and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. to remove cells and debris and transferred to 15 ml tubes. A control plate was also made following the same protocol but no DNA was used mock transfection yielding negative control conditioned media for binding experiments.

The concentration of each c fms avidin fusion protein was determined using a quantitative FACS based assay. Avidin fusion proteins were captured on 6.7 m biotin polystyrene beads Spherotech Inc. Libertyville Ill. . 1 conditioned media 2 20 and 200 l were added to 5 l 3.5 10 beads and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with rotation. Conditioned media was removed by centrifugation and samples were washed with PBS containing 2 FBS FPBS . The avidin beads were stained with 500 l of a 1.0 g ml solution of a FITC labeled goat anti avidin antibody Vector Labs Burlingame Calif. in FPBS for 30 minutes at room temperature with rotation. Following incubation the beads were recollected by centrifugation washed with FPBS and resuspended for analysis in 0.5 ml FPBS. The FITC fluorescence was detected using a FACScan Becton Dickinson Bioscience Franklin Lakes N.J. . The signal was converted to protein mass using a standard curve derived with rAvidin. For epitope mapping biotin beads were loaded with 200 ng of c fms avidin fusion protein per 3.5 10beads and brought up to volume with FPBS.

Biotin coated polystyrene beads Spherotech Inc. loaded with normalized amounts of c fms subdomain fusion proteins were mixed with 1 g of either human anti c fms monoclonal antibody 1.2 mouse anti c fms monoclonal antibody MAB 329 MAB 3291 and MAB3292 R D Systems or rat anti c fms monoclonal antibody 2 4A5 2 Invitrogen O.N.178 and 5J15 U.S. Biological in 0.2 ml of FPBS. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature the antibody bead complexes were washed three times with 1.25 ml washing buffer FPBS with collection by centrifugation for 1 min at 18 000 g between washes. The antibodies were then stained a species appropriate goat secondary antibody conjugated to FITC Southern Biotech at 1.0 g ml for 30 min. The wash steps were repeated and the antibody bead complexes were resuspended in 0.5 ml FPBS for analysis. The antibody bound to avidin bead complexes was detected by FACS Becton Dickinson analysis. The mean X fluorescent intensity was recorded for each sample.

To prepare for labeling with fluorescein the monoclonal antibodies were dialyzed or resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg ml in PBS pH 7.4 . Label 6 fluorescein 5 and 6 carboxamido hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester 5 6 SFX mixed isomers from Molecular Probes F 2181 was added to the protein at a 10 1 molar ratio label protein from a stock of 10 mg ml in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour in the dark. The labeled antibody was separated from the free label by NAP 5 column chromatography in PBS followed by 0.2 m filtration. For each competition experiment a binding reaction was assembled that contained a 25 fold excess 25 g ml of unlabeled competitor antibody 3.5 10biotin beads coated with the avidin fusion protein in FPBS. The FITC labeled antibody 1 g ml was added after a 15 min pre incubation. The process followed the one color method from this point forward.

All the fusion proteins expressed in 293T cells can be detected with FITC labeled anti avidin antibody by FACScan. As described in Example 12 several antibodies that were tested bind similar epitopes that require the presence of both Ig like loop 1 and Ig like loop 2 regions found in the Ig1 2 avidin fusion construct. Consequently binding and competition experiments were done with one of the human antibodies provided herein the commercially available anti human c fms antibodies and select members of the panel of avidin fusion constructs.

All of the commercial antibodies were able to successfully bind to the full length c fms ECD Ig1 5 construct as expected. Of the six commercial antibodies one MAB 3291 was able to bind to the Ig1 2 construct indicating a possible competitor for the human anti c fms epitopes. Further binding experiments were done using the Ig1 construct. MAB3291 was shown to bind the Ig1 construct indicating that its epitope was located entirely within the Ig1 like domain. The slight signal seen for MAB329 in the Ig1 and Ig1 2 constructs was confirmed to be background binding of the antibody to the beads.

The competition data demonstrated that none of the commercially sourced antibodies can block the representative human antibody even at a 25 fold excess of competitor antibody.

The combined data from the binding and competition experiments demonstrate that the commercial antibodies bind to epitopes which are not utilized by the human anti c fms antibodies.

An arginine glutamic acid scanning strategy was used to map antibody binding to c fms. The arginine and glutamic acid sidechains are charged and bulky and may disrupt antibody binding to c fms. This method can thus indicate residues that when mutated negatively affect the binding of the antigen binding protein to c fms. This indicates that the corresponding residues in the unmutated antigen binding protein can be in contact with the antigen binding protein or in close proximity to the antibody such that substitution with arginine or glutamic acid is sufficient to affect binding.

Ninety five amino acids distributed throughout the first three Ig domains of c fms were selected for mutation. The selection was biased towards charged or polar amino acids excluding cysteine and proline in order to reduce the likelihood of the mutation resulting in a misfolded protein. Non arginine amino acids were mutated to arginine arginine and lysine were mutated to glutamic acid.

Sense and anti sense oligonucleotides containing the mutated residues were synthesized in a 96 well format. Mutagenesis of the c fms extracellular domain Flag His tagged construct wild type was performed using a Quikchange II kit Stratagene 200523 . All mutant constructs of Flag His tagged c fms in the pTT5 vector were expressed in transiently transfected 293 6E suspension cells NRCC in 96 well plates. Expression levels and integrity of the recombinant protein in conditioned media were characterized by western blot against the His tag followed by an anti isotype Alexa fluor antibody. Subsequent epitope mapping experiments were performed using protein in conditioned media.

Mutant expression was characterized by running supernatants from each well on an ePage SDS PAGE electrophoresis apparatus Invitrogen blotting and probing with an anti His antibody Novagen followed by an anti isotype Alexa fluor antibody. Each mutant construct was expressed.

To determine whether anti c fms antibodies bound to a conformational epitope on c fms three anti c fms antibodies 1.2 SM 1.109 SM and 2.360 and c fms were individually run on western blots under reducing and non reducing conditions. Antibodies 1.2 SM and 2.360 were shown to bind a conformational epitope as evidenced by the lack of bands in western blots under reducing conditions whereas a light band was observed with antibody 1.109 SM indicating that it can bind a linear epitope.

A bead based multiplexed assay was used to measure antibody binding to the 95 c fms mutants wild type and a negative control simultaneously. One hundred sets of color coded strepavidin coated LumAvidin beads Luminex were bound with biotinylated anti pentaHis antibody Qiagen 1019225 for 1 hour at room temperature RT then washed. Each color coded bead set was then allowed to bind to a c fms mutant wild type or negative control in 100 l supernatant for 1 hour at RT and washed.

The color coded bead sets each associated to a specific protein were pooled. The pooled beads were aliquoted to 96 wells of a 96 well filter plate Millipore MSBVN1250 . 100 l of anti c fms antibodies 1.2 SM 1.109 SM and 2.360 in 3 fold dilutions were added to three columns for triplicate points and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed. 100 l of 1 200 dilution phycoerythrin PE conjugated anti human IgG Fc Jackson Immunoresearch 109 116 170 was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at RT and washed.

Beads were resuspended in 1 BSA in PBS shaken for 10 minutes and read on the BioPlex instrument Bio Rad . The instrument identified each bead by its color code and measured the amount of antibody bound to the beads according to the fluorescent intensity of the PE dye. Antibody binding to each mutant was compared directly to its binding to the wild type in the same pool.

The variability of the assay system and significance of changes in binding were determined empirically. Bead to bead and well to well variability was experimentally determined by binding wild type c fms to all 100 sets of color coded beads. Beads were dispensed to each well of a 96 well plate and probed with anti c fms antibody 1.2 SM in 3 fold dilutions down each column of the plate across all 12 columns of the plate. EC50 were derived using curve fits from measuring the variability of maximum signals minimum signals and slope. Variability measurements were used to determine whether a magnitude shift in EC50s was significant.

Mean fluorescence intensity MFI of antibody binding was graphed using a weighted 4 Parameter Logistical curve fit 4PL with VarPower in Splus . Experimental variability was determined using three wild type controls in each pool. Antibody binding to mutant antigen was compared to each wild type control. A 99 confidence interval CI of the EC50 fold change between mutant and each wild type control was calculated and the comparison to the wild type control giving the larger p value was reported. Multiplicity adjustment using Benjamini Hochberg False Discovery Rate FDR control was applied. Mutations whose 99 CI of the EC50 is significantly different from wild type EC50 that is having an FDR adjusted p value of 0.02 or less were considered important in the specific binding reaction between the protein antigen and antigen binding protein. In addition mutations that reduced binding as evidenced by a reduction in maximum MFI signal to 30 or less of wild type were considered to significantly influence binding between the protein antigen and antigen binding protein. Table 23 summarizes the hits or the position of mutations that significantly reduced the ability of the 1.2 SM 1.109 and 2.36 antibodies to bind the extracellular domain of human c fms. The notation used in Table 23 is wild type residue position in polypeptide mutant residue where the numbering is as shown in SEQ ID NO 1.

Because binding of at least one antibody is maintained in the presence of the particular mutations shown in Table 23 the mutant proteins are unlikely to be grossly misfolded or aggregated due to the introduced mutation. This is also true for those mutations which caused an EC50 shift for all of the antibodies as the antibodies are still able to bind antigen. Although each of the tested antibodies bind to a similar region as shown by the binning analysis each antibody can be distinguished by the mutations which inhibit antibody binding to mutant antigen. That some of the mutations affect multiple antibodies is consistent with the fact that the antibodies belong to similar bins.

Because the antigen binding proteins provided herein bind human c fms but not mouse c fms a series of in vivo experiments were conducted with an antibody that binds murine c fms to demonstrate the utility of an anti cfms antibody to treat cancer.

Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with 10 million MDAMB231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells in the presence of Matrigel 1 1 . Starting within one day of tumor cell implantation mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 400 g of anti murine c fms antibody or 400 g of control rat anti mouse IgG in 100 l PBS 3 times per week for the duration of the study. Tumor measurements and treatment days are shown in the . After 51 days mice were euthanized and tumors collected and formalin fixed. H E stained sections and F4 80 macrophage marker targeted immunohistochemistry sections were evaluated. All scoring was done blinded to treatment and group. Sections from mice treated with anti murine c fms antibody showed significantly less staining than mice treated with the control thus indicating a significant reduction in the number of tumor associated macrophages. To more objectively evaluate the extent of necrosis digital images of AFOG stained sections were captured using Metavue software the entire cross sectional area and necrotic cross sectional area of tumors were measured. The percent necrosis of each tumor was then calculated from these measurements and shown in . These results demonstrate that an anti c fms antibody can decrease tumor associated macrophages increase necrosis and inhibit the growth of MDAMB231 breast adenocarcinoma xenografts.

Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with 10 million NCIH1975 human lung adenocarcinoma cells in the presence of Matrigel 1 1 . After tumors were allowed to grow to 250 300 mm mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 400 g of anti murine c fms antibody or 400 g of control Rat anti mouse IgG in 100 l PBS 3 times per week for the duration of the study. A third group of mice was treated with 30 mg kg Taxotere positive control once per week. Tumor measurements and treatment days are shown in which shows that an anti cfms antibody can inhibit the growth of an established NCIH1975 lung adenocarcinoma xenograft.

The above tumor models demonstrate the utility of an anti cfms antibody that inhibits the activity of the CSF 1 cfms axis such as those disclosed herein for use in the treatment of cancer. The ability of such antibodies to decrease infiltrating macrophages in diseased tissue means that the antibodies can also be used in metabolic and inflammatory diseases.

To test whether CSF 1 mediated recruitment differentiation and stimulation of macrophages may be involved in promoting angiogenesis in tumors or other normal tissues two different neutralizing rat anti murine CSF 1R monoclonal antibodies M279 was generated internally the other FS98 was obtained from Ebiosciences were evaluated for their effect on mouse corneal angiogenesis in vivo. On day five after a single systemic dose of control mAb M279 or AFS98 the following parameters were measured and analyzed 1 the vascular density associated with the mouse corneal angiogenesis response 2 circulating levels of mouse CSF 1 and 3 levels of macrophage infiltration in the cornea and other tissues.

A 4 mm PVA sponge M PACT Worldwide Eudora Kans. was precisely cut into two equal pieces and immersed in 8 L1 of PBS containing 2.4 g of recombinant human FGF 2 or 48 g of recombinant human VEGF R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. . The sponge was further asceptically processed into 48 similarly sized mini sponge fragments pellets suitable for corneal pocket implantation. Each sponge fragment contained approximately 50 ng of recombinant human FGF 2 or 1 g of recombinant human VEGF. Female C57 BL 6 mice 7 10 weeks of age were anesthetized using systemic anesthesia and eyes prepared for corneal incision by placing a single drop of Proparacaine topical anesthetic in each eye. A fine slit was created in the middle of the cornea and an opening pocket created in the corneal stroma that followed the curvature of the eye approximately 1 mm from the limbus. Pellets containing PBS VEGF or FGF 2 were placed into the corneal pockets and animals treated with either rat IgG Sigma St. Louis Mo. IP at a dose of 250 g in 200 l pyrogen free PBS or with 250 g purified rat anti mouse CSF 1R. On day 5 post pellet implantation mice were anesthetized with systemic anesthesia and each eye cornea imaged under a stereomicroscope fitted with an Insight Spot digital camera fitted with a near vertical illuminator at an incipient angle of 45 degrees from the polar axis in the meridian containing the pellet. These acquired digital images were processed by subtractive color filters Adobe Photoshop and analyzed using Bioquant image analysis software Nashville Tenn. to determine the fraction of pixels within the total density of the corneal perimeter that exceeded a threshold matching visible capillaries. Total vascular density of the cornea was determined by using the fraction of pixels the result of which was expressed as a ratio of blood vessel area pixel number to whole eye area pixel number.

Serum levels of mouse CSF 1 were determined as a biomarker of anti CSF 1R antibody activity using the DUOSET antibody ELISA system R D systems according to the manufacturer s instructions.

To determine the effects of anti mouse CSF 1R antibodies on macrophage and blood vessel levels in tissue rat anti mouse F4 80 a macrophage restricted cell surface glycoprotein conjugated with Alexa 488 clone BM8 1 1000 was used to detect tissue macrophages. CD31 rat anti mouse PECAM 1 IgG2a conjugated with PE clone 390 use 1 g ml was used to detect endothelial cells. After tissue was harvested it was frozen in OCT for further processing. 5 micron sections of either liver or cornea were fixed with cold acetone for 15 min at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS. After washing sections were incubated in blocking solution BS for 30 min at room temperature. Both F4 80 488 and CD31 PE were added at the above concentrations in BS and sections incubated 30 minutes at room temperature followed by twice washing with PBS. Slides were mounted in mounting media and fluorescent images acquired with Leica Hamamutsu Openlab system.

Rat anti muCSF 1R neutralizing antibodies M279 and AFS98 significantly inhibited FGF 2 but not VEGF induced mouse corneal angiogenesis by approximately 80 P

When evaluating both angiogenic stimuli FGF 2 and VEGF blocking the CSF 1 CSF 1R interaction decreased macrophage infiltration to the tissue while it only inhibited FGF 2 angiogenesis based on corneal vessel density imaging. Based on these results it appears that the inflammatory environment dictates when CSF 1 responsive tissue macrophages can facilitate promote angiogenesis while at the same time illustrating that tissue macrophages at multiple inflammatory sites require ongoing CSF 1 CSF 1R interaction to maintain their presence at the inflammatory lesion. The results indicate that in cases where inflammatory angiogenesis is driven primarily by FGF 2 that inhibiting the CSF 1 CSF 1R interaction can be beneficial in decreasing new blood vessel formation especially in tumors where VEGF levels are not high but tumor vascular density is.

Cynomolgus monkeys were administered the 1.2 SM antibody and pharmocodynamic markers were measured. The cohort used to study the effects of a c fms antigen binding protein is shown in TABLE 24. Antibody 1.2 SM was administered weekly by intravenous injection to Cynomolgus monkeys for 4 weeks followed by an 11 week recovery period with terminal necropsy on day 29 and recovery necropsy at 3 months. Pharmocodynamic markers including serum CSF 1 levels Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b Trap5b concentrations and the quantity of colon macrophages were measured. As described in greater detail below the measurement of each of these markers demonstrated the ability of the antibody to bind c fms and inhibit the c fms CSF 1 axis. The level of the markers also correlated with the level of antibody in the blood.

Serum CSF 1 levels provide a biomarker for the presence and activity of anti c fms antibody. This is evidenced by the selective degradation by macrophage of I labeled CSF 1 in mice Tushinski R J et al. 1982 28 71 81 observations that CSF 1 is elevated in serum of the c fms knock out mice Dai X M et al. 2002 99 111 120 and demonstrations that serum CSF 1 levels are elevated in mice treated with an anti mouse c fms antibody.

Relative concentrations of Cynomolgus CSF 1 were determined for serum specimens collected at 7 8 29 57 85 and 99 days. Samples were analyzed using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA following the protocol provided by the assay manufacturer R D Systems Human CSF 1 DuoSet ELISA kit Minneapolis Minn. . Cynomolgus CSF 1 concentrations were determined by comparison to a human CSF 1 standard curve.

To measure the concentration of serum antibody 1.2 SM a mouse anti 1.2 SM antibody was passively adsorbed to Maxisorp microplate wells Nunc . The microplate wells were blocked with SuperBlock T20 Pierce Rockford Ill. after removing excess mouse anti 1.2 SM antibody. Standards and quality controls QCs were prepared by spiking antibody 1.2 SM into 100 Cynomolgus monkey serum pool. The microplate wells were washed following blocking. The standards matrix blank NSB QCs and study samples were thawed at ambient room temperature then loaded into the microplate wells after pretreating 1 50 with SuperBlock T20. The antibody 1.2 SM in the samples was captured by the immobilized mouse anti 1.2 SM antibody. Unbound antibody 1.2 SM was removed by washing the microplate wells. Following washing a second horseradish peroxidase HRP conjugated mouse anti 1.2 SM antibody was added to the microplate wells to bind the captured antibody 1.2 SM. Unbound HRP conjugated antibody was removed by washing. A 2 component 3 3 5 5 Tetramethylbenzidine TMB substrate solution was added to the wells. The TMB substrate solution reacted with peroxide and in the presence of HRP created a colorimetric signal that was proportional to the amount of antibody 1.2 SM bound by the capture reagent in the initial step. The color development was stopped and the intensity of the color optical density OD was measured at 450 nm to 650 nm. Data was reduced using Watson version 7.0.0.01 reduction package using a Logistic auto estimate 4 parameter logistic 4 PL regression model with a weighting factor of 1 Y.

Treatment of monkeys with antibody 1.2 SM resulted in a significant increase in serum CSF 1 levels and this correlated with the antibody serum concentration. Thus CSF 1 serum levels were found to increase after administration of antibody and its accumulation in the serum and then to decrease after administration was completed and the serum antibody levels decreased. These observations are consistent with the antibody acting on the c fms CSF 1 axis.

Trap5b levels provide a marker for anti c fms antibodies. Trap5b is specifically expressed by osteoclasts and is an indicator of osteoclast number. Osteoclasts which are derived from the myeloid lineage of hematopoietic cells express c fms and utilize CSF 1. Consistent with this is the observation that loss of CSF 1 results in decreased osteoclasts and levels of Trap5b in CSF 1 knock out op op mice Dai X M et al. 2002 99 111 120 .

The BoneTRAP assay Immunodiagnostic Systems Limited Fountain Hills Ariz. was used to quantitate TRAP5b in subjects. Antibody 1.2 SM serum concentrations were determined as described above. Levels of TRAP5b and antibody 1.2 SM in serum were determined for serum specimens collected at 7 8 29 57 85 and 99 days.

At day 29 of the dosing phase all subjects treated with 1.2 SM antibody had decreased Trap5b. Subsequent to treatment with antibody 1.2 SM serum Trap5b concentrations increased as serum antibody concentrations decreased. Treatment with antibody 1.2 SM correlated with a decreased serum Trap5b concentration.

As an additional indicator of the activity of antibody 1.2 SM in Cynomolgus monkeys the number of macrophages present in colon tissue was quantitated by laser scanning cytometry LSC of CD 68 stained tissue. Colon samples were collected from 3 animals sex group at the day 29 necropsy and 2 animals sex group at the day 100 necropsy. A sample of each tissue was collected in OCT Optimal Cutting Temperature media Sakura Finetek Torrance Calif. and frozen in a dry ice butane bath. Macrophages were stained using conventional immunohistochemistry with anti CD68 or an isotype antibody. Diaminobenzidine DAB positive events were enumerated using laser scanning cytometry LSC . A 2 scan method was used in which laser light absorption was quantified by the photodiode detector above the stage. The first low resolution pass identified the position of the section on the slide and the subsequent high resolution pass acquired field images. Quantitative analysis of DAB staining was performed using the LSC associated software.

TABLE 25 summarizes the changes in the number of colon macrophage immediately after treatment Day 29 and subsequent to a recovery period where antibody 1.2 SM was no longer administered Day 99 . As can be seen from this table administration of antibody 1.2 SM reduced the number of colony macrophage whereas the number of macrophage increased after treatment was discontinued thus demonstrating the activity of the antibody.
