This application is a continuation of and claims priority under 35 USC 120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 606 566 filed Nov. 29 2006 and entitled System and Method for Associating Audio Clips With Objects and further claims priority under 35 USC 119 e and 120 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 816 964 filed on Jun. 27 2006 and entitled System and Method for Associating Audio Clips with Objects both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Systems exist that permit a user to associate an audio file with an image. These systems permit the user to speak into a microphone connected to a personal computer in order to record the audio clip which is then associated with an image or a file. The limitation with such systems is that many users of personal computers either do not have a microphone or do not know how to use the microphone. In addition the audio clip generated using the computer microphone tends to be of poor quality and uncertain volume. Therefore these systems do not permit a good quality proper volume audio clip to be recorded so that the audio clip can be associated with the image or piece of content.

Voice mail systems evolved out of very basic proprietary systems and still demonstrate part of their heritage. Generally voicemail systems have a simple account management system where a user typically has an account that is nothing more than an extension or direct in bound dialing DID number. The security of the voicemail system is typically based on a 4 to 6 digit code that the user enters to access their mail box. The Programming of the voice mail system is generally a very simple text interface where a system administrator can enter values and record messages. The hierarchy or tree of prompts by an automated attendant is often as simple as starting at 1 2 or 3 and then expanding out to 1.1 2.1 3.1 and then on to 1.11 2.11 3.11 etc.

Newer systems such as Cisco Unity provide an Application Programming Interface API that allows more functionality such as connecting the voice mail system to a corporate email system. Even these modern unified voice mail solutions take a simple approach to storing data voice mails and verifying user identity. For example the Cisco Unity system records all voice mails into a single directory on the hard drive and then forwards the wave file to an email account associated with a DID number. The Unity system relies on Microsoft Exchange which in turn relies on Windows for user account authentication passwords storage size limits and access control lists. It would be desirable to be able to use a voicemail system with its security limitations to record an audio clip that can then be associated with an object. Thus it is desirable to provide a system and method for associating audio clips with objects that overcomes the limitations of the typical systems and it is to this end that the present invention is directed.

The system is particularly applicable to a web based system for associating an audio clip with a digital photograph on a website using a voicemail system and it is in this context that the system is described. It will be appreciated however that the system and method has greater utility since the system may be implemented using other technologies other communication networks and the like and may be used for a variety of different types of images. For example the system may be implemented with other voice based recording systems or it may be implemented using other communication networks other than the web based example set forth below. In addition the system may be implemented on a stand alone computer a peer to peer network etc and thus the system is not limited to the client server architecture using a browser described below. Finally the system may be used to associate an audio clip with various types of images and is not limited to the exemplary embodiment in which the system is used to associate an audio clip with a digital photograph. Now two exemplary implementations of the system are described in which the first implementation shown in is a rudimentary system while the implementation shown in illustrates a commercial implementation of the system.

The object hosting unit may further include a web server preferably implemented in software executed by the object hosting unit that pulls information from a data store to generate a web page that contains one or more pictures images. The web server is also capable of receiving information from a user entered into a web page and process that information. The object hosting unit may further include an audio clip processing unit and an audio clip association unit that may both preferably be implemented in software executed on the object hosting unit. The audio clip processing unit processes the incoming streaming audio data sent from the voicemail system and converts the streaming audio data into an audio clip file. The audio clip association unit associates the audio clip file with the appropriate object stored in the data store so that the user can access the object and the associated audio clip. Now a commercial implementation of the system is described with reference to .

The system couples one or more user locations over the communications link to the object hosting unit . In this implementation each user location may include the computing device and a voice based device . As with the system shown in the voice based device such as a telephone cellular phone voice over IP phone etc. may be used to provide an audio caption for the images wherein the audio caption is gathered by the audio clip processing unit that may be a voice over IP service gateway. In the system the voice based device which is ubiquitous today is used as a mechanism to capture an audio caption. The process by which the user is prompted to provide that audio caption can include either the user dialing a number to connect to the audio clip processing unit or alternatively the system can call the user at a predetermined phone number provided to the system by the user as a setting in order to capture the audio caption. The audio clips gathered and processed by the audio clip processing unit which are converted into digital format are passed over the communications link to the object hosting unit . In the implementation shown in the communications link may include a network such as the Internet World Wide Web local area network wide area network wireless network for example a router and a well known firewall . The communications link may be used to connect the computing device of the user to the unit and the audio processing unit to the unit wherein the various units and devices can establish communication sessions with each other and then communicate with each other over the communications link.

The object hosting unit in this implementation may include one or more server computers that implement the operations of the object hosting unit wherein the servers are well known server computers that execute software and software applications to perform the various functions described below. In particular the object hosting unit may include one or more business and reporting servers that handle various business and reporting function of the system one or more web servers one or more Asterisk PBX servers and one or more monitoring and control servers that perform system management functions of the system.

The one or more web servers may provide web services for the system wherein the web services consist of a front end application logic that dynamically creates the web pages examples of which are described below with reference to that are presented to the end user the user interface based on their user account desired view on the current page and or steps within a process within one of the interactive user pages. These web services also interact with the other component services to collect display data retrieve store files and or control telephony integration like voice recording playback and calls to the user. Each web server may also securely authenticate the user when they sign into the service via standard SSL functionality . The Web servers are configured to scale out horizontally as service load increases via system based load balancing at smaller scale and or network based load balancing as scale increases .

The one or more asterisk PBX servers provide telephony services that contain the key functionality that ties the web experience to the VoIP and standard telephone networks. These services consist of the PBX and middle tier applications that manage the state of the calls interface with the web application convert the voice to audio and store the files on the file servers. In more detail the one or more asterisk PBX servers run the open source Asterisk PBX service which is capable of pure VoIP telephony integration and customizable call control via its software interfaces. Each Asterisk PBX server connects to multiple VoIP telephone lines that can be used to call the end user for the purpose of recording captions comments. The VoIP allows the service to call any type of telephone service that uses a telephone number e.g. standard phone networks cell phone networks and other IP phone networks . The server also contains the functionality that allows for the conversion of the user captions comments to a storable and playback compatible audio format. Like the web servers the one or more asterisk PBX servers are also configured to scale out as load to service increases or the demand for phone lines increases.

The data store in this implementation may include one or more database servers and one or more file servers wherein these servers provide the database services and file services respectively for the system . The database services are used to access and or store user specific information e.g. account information picture information categorizations story boards image to audio clip associations etc . The database services consist of the actual database server and any components that have been written to access and or manipulate the data. A custom database schema has been designed for the service and then used with the MySQL application as the database server. The database servers run database services and contain the user profile information along with the pointer information for each image and its associated audio file s . The database service will scale up as user capacity needs to grow until a point is reached where users will have to be federated off to multiple database servers. Redundancy for database services is addressed via disk dumps to other online storage.

The file services consist of one or more file server s that are used to store image files and their associated caption audio clips. The SUSE Linux file share services are leveraged and the files are accessed via a file services layer in the application. In more detail the file servers run simple and scalable network attached file services where both the image and audio files are stored in unique user directories. The file services are designed to scale both out and up.

The server process . permits the integration of a traditional web application service with telephone networks via a VoIP PBX. This process controls the dialing recording and process flow of a user telephone session in addition to tracking and communicating the state of the voice sessions and the VoIP phone lines . It ties the web front end and VoiceCaptionIt APIs together with the Asterisk PBX APIs creating the ability to call the user record a caption and associate the caption or a voice comment with a specific image.

The Asterisk server process provides the telephony services and APIs that are controlled by the VoiceCaptionIt server process. These are called in order to place originate calls to control VoIP connectivity phone lines to manage voice automation call trees and to convert calls to caption or comment audio files.

The system may include fault tolerance that is handled using fault tolerant capabilities built into the operating system application servers and development environment coupled with the monitoring and automation system. The system may include user authentication to the system that is protected by SSL encryption and all user passwords are encrypted before being stored in any system. The system level security is managed through automated security upgrades to the operating system and application servers running on each server role. The system level security may also include system specific access control to prevent the spread of a vulnerability that is limited to a server role or application. The system may also include standard network level security standards including network and host based firewalls routing controls and monitoring of network port and bandwidth utilization.

The system may also include monitoring and alarm functions capacity tracking and analysis and performance and availability reporting. As mentioned above an open source monitoring alarming and automation system called Zabbix is leveraged to monitor and control the application and system architecture. Using Zabbix key scenarios and services are checked by the system and when a failure is detected scripts are automatically invoked to correct the condition. As additional failure conditions are identified by the system they will be added to the automation capabilities. Operations personnel may be alerted whenever conditions are not successfully auto corrected and key service metrics are also tracked by the system.

For the capacity tracking and analysis basic capacity modeling around CPU utilization memory usage disk space and disk I O coupled with transaction tracking will drive scale out and scale up discussions. The tracking and analysis will be delivered via the monitoring system which allows for robust reporting of capacity indicators. Additional reporting for web log analysis will also be leveraged in building a more robust model. Now the method for integrating an audio clip is described in more detail.

To better understand this method an example of the user flow for a new user visiting the object hosting unit posting a picture and then associating an audio recording with the picture will be described. In a first step the new user creates an account with the object hosting unit. It is important to note when this account is created the user s access control for the entire website is determined. This security system will be integrated with the voice mail system as described below. For example to create a new account the user may go to a secure SSL web site page and enter basic identity information such as first name last name email address password and password reminder. This information will be collected using an industry standard encrypted system such as ASP PHP or JSP with the associated secure database system. Once the user has created the account the user is provided with a numeric code for his audio recording voice mail box and a numeric password to access it just like a voice mail PIN for a typical voicemail system .

The user is now able to post pictures to the object hosting unit. For example a user may choose to post a picture of a parcel of property where he is building a house. To post the picture the user goes through the standard process of selecting a file off of his computer s hard drive or from any other location making sure it is within reasonable size limits and then uploads it to the object hosting unit in a known manner. Once the picture is uploaded onto the object hosting unit the user sitting at his computing device sees the picture on his her screen. Examples of the user interface of the system is described below with reference to .

When the user requests to associate an audio file with an image the user may be presented with a dialog box with a message such as the following message Call our toll free number at 800 123 4567 enter your account number 12345 your PIN 9876 and then record your message and enter your session number of 4567 . The user may then pick up the phone and call the toll free number. The automated attendant asks the user to enter his account number 12345 then asks the user to enter the user s PIN.

Once the user enters his her PIN number the user is now in a secure voice mail area where the user can leave one or more messages wherein each message can be an audio clip to be associated with an object. In the example the automated attendant tells the user to enter the key when he is done recording his message. As an example the user says In this picture you can see the survey stakes marking the outline of the home. My wife is standing at the edge of where the living room will be and my son has climbed an oak tree that we will look at from our living room and then he hits the button. The automated attendant may now permit the user to indicate that he she is satisfied with his message and if so press . In this example the user presses the button. Then the automated attendant asks for his session number and the user enters 4567 and then hangs up. This session number is uniquely identified with him as a user and with the picture he has posted using a relational database and global unique identifiers GUID s for all the content objects in the system . Thus each audio message left in the voicemail system is uniquely associated with a particular object for a particular user.

In an alternative method for capturing the audio caption of the user the system may automatically prompt the user to provide the audio caption or voice comment. In particular once the user has selected to add an audio caption or voice comment to an object the system automatically contacts the user at a predetermined phone number which may be a cellular phone landline or voice over IP based phone and the like that the user has previously provided to the system. In this method the system thus automates the audio caption or voice comment capturing process which makes it easier for the user to enter the audio caption or voice comment into the system.

In one exemplary embodiment a voice mail server pushes the audio file to a streaming audio server e.g. RealServer or Windows Media Server where it was converted into an industry standard streaming audio format e.g. RealAudio WindowsMedia WAV or AU and posted to a streaming audio media server. The audio GUID is associated with the picture GUID in the global relational database in the data store so that the user and anyone who the user grants access to his photo album sees the picture and also sees the audio clip indicator next to the picture. If the user clicks on the audio clip indicator or the picture the system will stream the audio recording to the end user s computer and the sound will play over their computer speakers. In another exemplary embodiment the audio file is stored in a format such that a streaming media server is not required.

The system may include picture cropping and there may be a predetermined number such as 4 of sizes of each image that may be stored on the image server and the corresponding location stored in the database. The image sizes may include native images large display sizes medium display sizes and small display size. For the native image sizes any member can upload an image of any size to VoiceCaptionIt.com. The large display size is the image size used for pages like Landing Page Photo Details and Browse. For this large display image the system needs to resize the Native Image into an image with a maximum X axis of 500 pixels using the same aspect ratio of the Native Image. The medium display size is the image size used for pages like Highest Rated and My Photos. For this medium display image the system needs to resize the Native Image into an image with a maximum X axis of 150 pixels using the same aspect ratio of the Native Image.

For the small display size this is the image size used for pages like Landing Page left side Batch Manager My Friends and Browse left side . For the aesthetics of these pages to work the images need to be 50 50 pixels with no white space . Since most pictures are not perfectly square the system will need to pre process each image in order to store a square image. An example of a process to pre process the image may include the following steps 

3. Divide the longest axis by the short axis to get the aspect ratio. If the aspect ratio is greater than 1 skip to Step 5.

This will create a thumbnail with a 50 50 pixel size with no white space. While it will remove some of the picture from the longest axis it will preserve the most detail in the image so the user can recognize the Native Image. Now examples of the web pages generated by the system in the exemplary implementation will be described. It should be understood that these user interfaces can be provided to the user by other means so that the system is not limited to delivering these user interfaces to the user using the exemplary web pages described below.

Examples of the user interfaces when the user is logged into the system are described with reference to and examples of the user interfaces when a user or interested user are not logged into the system are described with reference to .

As shown in the user interface of the landing page may include a recent uploads by the user portion a friend s portion a most recent uploads by any user portion a VoiceCaption of the day that may include a rating . For the recent uploads by the user portion . the database pushes down communicates over the communications link to the computing device a predetermined number such as 5 as shown in of most recent photos uploaded to the site by the user that is logged in chocosaur in this example . The database may push down the pictures using the smallest thumbnail 50 50 pixels size photo and the recent upload may be in chronological order.

For the friend s portion the database pushes down a predetermined number such as 5 as shown in of most recent photos uploaded to the site by friends of the user that is logged in. For example chocosaur is logged in and she has 3 friends Dave Eddy and Bill. In one example Dave uploaded one new picture yesterday Eddy uploaded 3 new pictures today and Bill uploaded 5 new pictures yesterday. The database will need to analyze the date time stamp of all 9 pictures sort them and push down the 5 most recent pictures. The database will need to know who is logged in who all your friends are and when they uploaded their pictures in order to be able to provide the friend s portion. The images shown in the friend s portion may be in chronological order using the smallest thumbnail 50 50 pixels size photo.

For the most recent uploads by any user portion the database pushes down the a predetermined number such as 5 as shown in of most recent photos uploaded to the site by anyone. To accomplish this the database analyzes the date time stamp of all recent pictures during a predetermined time period such as the last 24 hours sorts them and pushes down the most recent ones wherein the images may be in chronological order and may use the smallest thumbnail 50 50 pixels size photo.

For the VoiceCaption of the day the database may push down a VoiceCaption of the Day a picture with its linked VoiceCaption along with the title of that picture the user who uploaded it and it s overall rating for example using a 5 star system as shown in .

The personal info portion may contain information entered into the user profile including an address phone numbers up to three in this example an email address that is unique to each user wherein the email address can be changed and the user s icon as described above. The intro caption portion permits each user to toggle this feature ON OFF and permits the user to record a short such as 1 minute voice introduction about themselves. When another user browses their profile assuming their profile can either be viewed by their Friends or Everyone they will be able to listen to their voice profile. For this screen the database will need to send down the state on or off of the intro caption.

The place holder caption portion permits each user to toggle this feature ON OFF and permits the user to create a simple generic VoiceCaption caption the system will use in the event they haven t created one for a particular picture. For example imagine the scenario where a user has uploaded 50 photos and starts to voice caption them but runs out of time. During that time someone browses his photos and is listening to the voice captions. They would get to a photo with a Place Holder Caption and likely hear something like Sorry I just uploaded this photo and haven t had time to voice caption it yet. Please check back tomorrow. 

The user can select to sort what images to batch edit see the sort by portion at the upper right corner of the user interface by 

The database also needs to send down the logged in user icon next to chocosaur s Photo Manager in this image .

For the highest rated portion the database may push down a predetermined number such as 5 of the highest rated images VoiceCaptions for the entire site in chronological order. In the event there are more than 5 images that have the highest possible rating 5 stars which is quite likely the database will need to push down the 5 most recent images VoiceCaptions that are highest rated. The more hyperlink will lead to a separate page capable of showing more highly rated images VoiceCaptions.

For the most captioned portion the database may push down a predetermined number such as 5 of the highest VoiceCaptioned images regardless of when they were uploaded to our site . The portion alternatively may display the most VoiceComments images since each image can only have one VoiceCaption. In the event there are more than 5 images that have the most VoiceComments which is quite likely the database will need to push down the 5 most recent images with the most VoiceComments. The database may push down the pictures using the smallest thumbnail 50 50 pixels size photo and keep them in chronological order.

For the tag portion the database may send down a predetermine number such as 40 of the most used text tags in the system. To do this the database may maintain a current count of all tags used by all users and sort it from highest to lowest or at least the 40 highest . The database may separate the 40 most used tags into 5 groups of 8 and add the group number to each one of the to 40 tags. Then the database will need to sort the 40 top tags into alphabetical order. The client will then parse and use the appropriate size font largest font for group 1 smallest font for group 5 for the layout based on the overall display of alphabetical order.

For this page the database may keep a count of all highest rated images. Given the expected popularity of VoiceCaptionIt the database should only need to track images VoiceCaptions with a rating of 4 stars or higher 4.0 . However if there are more than 60 of those then it should limit this to 10 pages of 6 photos each so that the bottom navigation doesn t become impractical. The page may use the Medium size image 150 150 .

For each of the above different ways to sort the images the server keeps track of the total number of images and then divide that by 6 to come up with the page count at the bottom. The page number display at the bottom 1 7 in the example should be limited to 10 pages. However since this is the only way a user can actually see ALL their pictures it does need to increment decrement pages when the user moves to the right or left. For example if a user has uploaded 100 images that would be 17 pages of images. Since this display is limited to 10 then it would show 1 10 to start but when the user selected page 10 then the page number display would change from being 1 10 to 2 11.

The database may also send down the user icon next to chocosaur s Photos in this example . I think we can get rid of the smaller icon used next to chocosaur on the right nav if this is the only place we are using it.

The other aspect are similar to the browse page described above with reference to and will not be described again here.

While the foregoing has been with reference to a particular embodiment of the invention it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes in this embodiment may be made without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention the scope of which is defined by the appended claims.
