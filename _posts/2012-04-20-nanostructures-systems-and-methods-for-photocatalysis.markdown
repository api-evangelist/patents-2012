All of the foregoing applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for any and all purposes.

This invention was made with the support under government contract DE AR0000036 awarded by the Department of Energy DOE Advanced Research Project Agency Energy ARPA E . The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to the field of nanostructures and to the field of photocatalytic reactions.

Photocatalysis involves the use of light to overcome thermodynamic and kinetic reaction barriers in chemical reactions. The energy change associated with a given chemical reaction may be described by the Gibbs Free Energy G. In the case where the G for a reaction is positive energy must be added to the system to accomplish the desired reaction. This energy may be provided in the form of light and photocatalysts may be used to facilitate the conversion of photons into stored chemical energy.

A non limiting application of this concept is the capture conversion and storage of solar energy through the rearrangement of chemical bonds to make fuel. Solar energy can be considered to be a carbon neutral energy source of sufficient scale to meet future global energy demand. Thus the conversion of sunlight into chemical fuels offers a viable mechanism for renewable energy storage and utilization. A typical photocatalytic system employs at least one photoactive composition which upon exposure to sunlight produces electron hole pairs that may be used to drive chemical reactions that store energy.

In this context several energy storing reactions are particularly suitable including the conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen i.e. water splitting the conversion of nitrogen to ammonia the conversion of hydrohalic acids to hydrogen and halide e.g. 2HBr H Br and the conversion of carbon dioxide to any number hydrocarbon fuel products. Production of materials that may be used as fuels e.g. the foregoing materials is considered especially suitable reduction of metals e.g. Ag to Ag is somewhat less suitable.

However light does not readily cause each of these chemical reactions to occur and catalysts are needed to effect the overall transformation with efficiencies suitable for practical applications. Photochemical systems comprised of photocatalysts that may be suspended or dissolved in solution offer a low cost mechanism solar energy conversion. Traditional approaches to photocatalysis have relied on the use of expensive materials and or systems that operate with low efficiency. Therefore a need remains for the development of novel photocatalysts comprised of low cost materials that operate with high efficiency for solar energy conversion.

In one embodiment the present disclosure provides nanostructures the nanostructures suitably comprising a first region comprising a first material that catalyzes the formation of O2 from water and a second region comprising a second material that catalyzes the formation of hydrogen a reduced form of nitrogen a reduced form of carbon dioxide or any combination thereof the first and second regions comprising semiconductors.

In another embodiment the present disclosure provides nanostructures the nanostructures comprising an iron oxide and comprising a first n type region and a second p type region.

The present disclosure also provides compositions the compositions comprising a plurality of nanostructures as described herein. The present disclosure further provides photocatalytic devices the photocatalytic devices comprising a plurality of nanostructures as described herein.

Also provided are method of forming systems. These methods include providing a semiconductor substrate exposing the semiconductor substrate to a solution comprising at least one metal ionic species and an anionic species and exposing the semiconductor substrate to electromagnetic radiation forming a first surface presenting catalytic material comprising a reduced metal species in a first region and a second surface presenting catalytic material comprising an oxidized metal species in a second region.

Further provided are methods the methods suitably including exposing to electromagnetic radiation a plurality of nanostructures at least one of which nanostructures is a nanostructure according to the present disclosure and catalyzing the formation of O2 from water.

Additionally provided are methods. These methods include exposing to electromagnetic radiation a plurality of nanostructures at least one of which nanostructure is a nanostructure according to the present disclosure and effecting a reduction reaction involving at least some of the nanostructures.

The present disclosure also provides devices for solar energy conversion the devices suitably including the foregoing compositions.

Other aspects embodiments and features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. The accompanying figures are schematic and are not intended to be drawn to scale. For purposes of clarity not every component is labeled in every figure nor is every component of each embodiment of the invention shown where illustration is not necessary to allow those of ordinary skill in the art to understand the invention. All patent applications and patents incorporated herein by reference are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict the present specification including definitions will control.

The present invention generally relates to nanostructures and related compositions methods of making and using the nanostructures and related systems. Many aspects and embodiments of the invention involve nanometer scale articles and systems but larger articles and systems are provided as well. The subject matter of the present invention involves in some cases interrelated products alternative solutions to a particular problem and or a plurality of different uses of one or more systems and or articles.

According to some aspects of the present invention nanostructures are provided for a variety of applications. In some embodiments the nanostructures may be used for photocatalytic reactions. Photocatalysis e.g. involving an oxidation and or reduction reaction may proceed upon exposure of the nanostructures to electromagnetic radiation without the need for an external voltage source. For example in some cases the nanostructures allow for the conversion of water to hydrogen gas and or oxygen gas using at least one nanostructure and without an external power and or energy source. Thus energy can be stored via a reactive pathway involving nanostructures of the invention in the form of oxygen gas and hydrogen gas. It should be understood that a user may expose one or even a plurality of nanostructures according to any part of the present disclosure to electromagnetic radiation so as to catalyze the formation of O2 from water. In some embodiments a user may expose one or more nanostructures according to any part of the present disclosure so as to catalyze a reduction reaction.

It should be noted that while photochemical of water splitting is discussed in many embodiments described herein this is by no means limiting and other photochemical reactions may be carried out using the nanostructures compositions methods and systems of the present invention as described herein. These reactions include but are not limited to the conversion of nitrogen to ammonia the conversion of hydrohalic acids to hydrogen and halide e.g. 2HBr H Br the conversion of methanol to hydrogen and an oxidized form of carbon and the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and or the conversion of and or formation of any number hydrocarbon fuels e.g. methane ethane etc. .

Nanostructures of the invention can comprise at least one catalytic material. The catalytic material may include a low cost earth abundant material or multiple materials of this type and or other materials and the methods for forming the catalytic material may be carried out with ease. In addition many of the methods and systems may be operated under ambient conditions e.g. temperature pressure and at about neutral pH with good efficiency. In some cases water for photocatalysis may be supplied from an impure water source. Accordingly because the systems can be operated under mild conditions the system components may be greatly simplified as compared to systems which are not operated under mild conditions. For example a photocatalytic system for water splitting may comprising a plurality of nanostructures suspended in impure water in a plastic bag and the electrolysis may occur upon exposure of the nanostructures to sunlight. Further benefits of the nanostructures compositions methods and systems are described herein.

The term nanostructure as used herein refers to structures which are nanoscopic. As used herein nanoscopic scale nanoscopic nanometer scale nanoscale the nano prefix for example as in nanostructured and the like generally refers to elements or articles having widths or diameters of less than about 1 micron. The specified widths can be a smallest width i.e. a width as specified where at that location the article can have a larger width in a different dimension or a largest width i.e. where at that location the article has a width that is no wider than as specified but can have a length that is greater . Non limiting examples of nanostructures include nanowires nanorods nanotubes nanoparticles etc. as describe herein. As described herein a nanostructure may comprise one or more materials and or components.

Without wishing to be bound by theory many of the nanostructures of the present invention operate according to the following mechanism. In embodiments where a nanostructure comprising a first region and a second region is exposed to light charge separation may occur between the first region and the second region wherein an excess of electrons are present in the first region and an excess of holes are present in the second region. For example for a nanostructure comprising a first region defining primarily or exclusively a first semiconductor material and a second region defining primarily or exclusively a second semiconductor material upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation electrons may be excited from the valence band to the conduction band in the first region e.g. comprising an n type semiconductor thereby creating holes in the valence band and free electrons in the conduction band. The excited electron and corresponding electron hole may separate spatially within the n type semiconductor material from the point of generation. The electrons produced at the first region may be transported e.g. via the nanostructure material to the second region of the nanostructure e.g. comprising a p type semiconductor . It should be understood that embodiments where the first and second regions are both semiconductors are considered especially suitable. The first and second regions need not be the same semiconductor. The separated electron holes may be transported to a nanostructure electrolyte interface at each region where they may be used to carry out an electrochemical reaction e.g. a redox reaction. For example the holes electrons can react with a water molecule resulting in the formation of oxygen gas and or hydrogen ions. As one non limiting example the nanostructure may include a first region that catalyzes the formation of O2 from water. The nanostructure may also include a second region that catalyzes the formation of one or more of H2 a reduced form of N2 or even a reduced form of CO2. Suitable reduced forms of N2 include NH3 NH4 ions N2H4 urea and the like. Suitable reduced forms of CO2 include CO formic acid formate formaldehyde hydrocarbons and even alcohols. Some such materials include methane ethylene ethanol methanol and the like. As another example the holes electrons can react with a halide ion e.g. Br alternatively in the form HBr resulting in the formation of halogen e.g. Br or Hand Br . Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand the mechanism described herein and the similarities of the mechanism with those described for heterojunction photovoltaic cells or p n junction photovoltaic cells.

Nanostructures of the invention whether in the form of nanorods or otherwise in most embodiments are composed of a bulk composition or material and a surface presenting catalytic material which can be the same or different than the underlying bulk material . In some embodiments of the invention another material hereafter referred to as a shell material may cover at least a portion of the surface of the bulk composition and may in some cases partially or fully separate the bulk material from the surface presenting catalytic material. The bulk material in most embodiments is a composition including at least one type of semiconductor material.

In one aspect of the invention the combination of the nanostructure bulk any optional shell material and any surface presenting catalytic material if different from the bulk together defines a nanostructure that is at least somewhat non uniform with respect to semiconductor characteristic and or becomes at least somewhat non uniform upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation. For example in some embodiments the nanostructure comprises a semiconductor material with dopants which are primarily n type in nature in a first region and dopants which are primarily p type in nature in a second region. For example where the nanostructure is a nanorod one region e.g. end of the nanorod can exhibit more n type dopants with a second region e.g. the other end exhibiting more p type dopants.

 Bulk in this context means a majority of the mass of the nanostructure including or excluding a small region near the surface of the nanostructure. E.g. the bulk can define at least 60 70 80 90 or greater the mass of the nanostructure typically the central portion of the nanostructure extending outwardly toward the surface. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand the meaning of this term from this definition and as it is used in the context of the description of this invention.

In one set of embodiments the makeup of the bulk composition of the nanostructure defines a non uniform semiconductor characteristic. In one embodiment the nanostructure includes two relatively discrete sections one comprising a primarily n type semiconductor material and the other comprising a primarily p type semiconductor material with a relatively abrupt transition between those two semiconductor materials. For example a nanorod can be made up of essentially uniform n type semiconductor material along a portion of its length and then relatively abruptly the material can shift to p type semiconductor material and remain relatively uniformly p type semiconductor material for the remainder of its length. In other arrangements a transition between any n type or p type semiconductor material is not abrupt and the structure defines a first section of relatively uniform n type semiconductor material a second section of relatively p type semiconductor material and an intermediate section involving different material or a transition gradual or otherwise between the n type and p type semiconductor material sections. In another arrangement various sections of nanostructure bulk can exist with different characteristics of any number of them so long as overall the nanostructure exhibits primarily n type dopants at one section and primarily p type dopants at a different section. In another arrangement the nanostructure bulk is primarily but not exclusively p type at one end primarily but not exclusively n type at another end with a transition between those ends from n type to p type where the transition can represent a mixture of the two semiconductor types in changing ratio along the pathway from the first end to the second end. The transition can be linear i.e. essentially consistently gradual or can be non linear as would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that in addition to this description the invention contemplates any number of other arrangements of n type and p type material within the bulk of the nanostructure that provide a result suitable for use in the invention.

In some embodiments the bulk material may be silicon with a dopant or dopants e.g. germanium the concentration of which varies from one end or region of the nanostructure to another end or region of the nanostructure. In some arrangements the changes in concentration may be abrupt such as in a multi junction Si nanorod between neighboring regions of the nanostructure. In another embodiment the changes in concentration of the dopant may vary smoothly or in a more linear fashion from one region of the nanostructure to another region. For non limiting examples of compositions suitable for use as a bulk material see and additional configurations described herein.

Moreover in the description above any number of materials can substitute from n type and or p type semiconductor material so long as the bulk in this set of embodiments in which bulk composition varies can be used to establish a nanostructure particle allowing different photocatalytic reactions to occur at different sections of the nanostructure. For example in the section described above the first region may comprise a first type of semiconductor material and the second region may comprise a second type of semiconductor material wherein the first type of semiconductor material and the second type of semiconductor materials do not differ only by the dopant e.g. the materials are not simply a semiconductor material doped with a first dopant to produce the n type material and the same or essentially similar semiconductor material doped with a second dopant to produce a p type material . In one embodiment the first type of semiconductor material may be CdSe and the second type of semiconductor material may be CdS.

In the description above there need not be a significant transition between the bulk of the nanostructure and surface presenting catalytic material of the nanostructure. I.e. there can be a transition from one section of the nanostructure to another in terms of composition as described but with the surface being essentially similar to that of the underlying bulk. In another set of embodiments one or more sections of the nanostructure can include a surface presenting catalytic material that is significantly different than that of the bulk. In one set of embodiments the bulk of the nanostructure can be essentially homogeneous throughout without the different n type p type regions as described above but where one section of the nanostructure includes more surface presenting catalytic material or a different surface presenting catalytic material than another. For example a nanorod can have an essentially uniform bulk with one end e.g. a first region of the nanorod having a surface presenting catalytic material that is present in less quantity or essentially absent from the other end e.g. a second region of the nanorod. In another embodiment within this category one end e.g. a first region of the nanorod can carry a first surface presenting catalytic material and the other end e.g. a second region of the nanorod can carry a second different surface presenting catalytic material. In another embodiment the entire nanorod can include uniformly or nonuniformly a surface presenting catalytic material that differs in composition across the nanostructure e.g. the nanostructure might include a first material and a second material and optionally additional materials with the first material present predominantly at a first section e.g. a first region of the nanostructure surface and a second material present predominantly at a second section e.g. a second region of the nanostructure surface with a mixture of the first and second materials present at a third section of the nanostructure surface. In one embodiment within this category the mixture of the first and second materials can exist essentially throughout the surface of the nanostructure but in different ratios such that the first material is more prevalent at one section or region e.g. one end of the nanostructure and the second material is more prevalent at another section or region e.g. the opposite end of the nanostructure.

The first and second materials can be catalytic materials that catalyze different oxidation and or reduction reactions respectively and or can be materials which can attract and or bind in later synthetic steps and or within a photocatalytic reaction itself catalytic materials. As noted the first and or second materials can be both provided optionally in combination with other materials or one material only can be provided distributed disproportionately at one section of the surface of the nanostructure. This arrangement of surface presenting catalytic materials can be provided as described upon an essentially uniform bulk nanostructure or in combination with a nanostructure bulk that differs in composition as described above. For example the bulk of the nanostructure can include one section or region e.g. one end that is predominantly an n type semiconductor material and another section or region e.g. another end that is predominantly a p type semiconductor material and one or both of the n type and or p type sections can carry a surface presenting catalytic material that is different from the majority of the n type and or p type bulk. Surface presenting catalytic materials are described herein and in some cases may comprise photosensitizing agent and or a catalytic material

As noted an optional shell material can be provided between the bulk of the nanostructure and any surface presenting catalytic material. The shell can be selected to provide any of a variety of functionalities as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the description of this invention which may be advantageous in carrying out the invention. For example the shell can be made of material selected to inhibit corrosion of a bulk semiconductor material of the nanostructure. A variety of such materials can be used for the shell as those of ordinary skill in the art would understand. In some embodiments the shell may be a semiconductor material that is transparent to visible light including but not limited to TiO SrTiO ZnO indium tin oxide ITO fluorine tin oxide FTO CeO SiO In another embodiment the shell may be a polymer that is transparent to visible light such as PTFE.

In a particular embodiment a shell of titanium dioxide that covers portions of the nanostructure bulk i.e. which separates portions of the semiconductor bulk from a surrounding medium and or from a surface presenting catalytic material can be selected. In one arrangement the shell coats portions or all of the nanostructure bulk. In such an arrangement for example a semiconductor bulk can be presented e.g. comprising a predominantly n type semiconductor material in a first region or section and a predominantly p type semiconductor material is a second region or section and coated with a shell of titanium dioxide or other material selected to prevent corrosion of the semiconductor materials. Surface presenting catalytic material can exist upon one or more sections of the shell as described above with respect to the arrangement to surface presenting catalytic materials on sections of the bulk material. In such arrangements the shell may be selected to be of a composition and thickness so as to be sufficiently transparent to electromagnetic radiation at a wavelength that activates catalytic activity of the bulk nanostructure material and of a conductivity that allows electron and or hole transport between the bulk nanostructure material across the shell to a surface presenting catalytic material if present wherein the material selected provide parameters which are sufficient to allow the nanostructure and any surface presenting catalytic materials which are present to carry out photocatalysis as described herein. In one set of embodiments the shell is selected both in material composition and thickness to be transparent in a direction orthogonal to the surface to electric magnetic radiation at a wavelength promoting photocatalysis in an amount of at least 50 60 70 80 or 90 transmittance.

Non limiting examples of suitable arrangements for a nanostructure of the present invention are shown in . It should be understood that each of the bulk materials in may comprise a single or any number of combinations of materials for example those described throughout the specification included those depicted in . It is also to be understood that a shell material is optional in each case and may or may not completely or evenly coat the bulk of the nanostructure. Further where surface presenting catalytic materials are illustrated they can but need not define a relatively even coating on the bulk and or on the shell.

Any or all of the above arrangements can be used alone or in combination. For example the bulk material can be essentially homogenous or can include separate materials and or sections a shell can be used but need not be and the nanostructure can include one or more surface presenting catalytic materials different from the bulk of the nanostructure. Where surface presenting catalytic materials are used they need not coat the nanostructure in a way that would separate the bulk of the nanostructure from a surrounding medium but can be provided in a island like manner a pattern or otherwise partially or fully cover the bulk nanostructure.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of methods and techniques to determine the components of a nanostructure. For example in some embodiments the element composition of a nanostructure may be assessed using electron microscopy e.g. transmission electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy.

In some embodiments a nanostructure as described herein may be used for photocatalysis. As used herein the term photocatalysis refers to a process of the acceleration of a photoreaction in the presence of a photocatalyst. In some embodiments a nanostructure as described herein may be used for the photoelectrolysis of water or other materials and in some cases covert light to electrical energy. In some cases the nanostructure may solely use solar energy e.g. sunlight as the power source. Electrolysis as used herein refers to the use of an electric current to drive an otherwise non spontaneous chemical reaction. For example in some cases electrolysis may involve a change in redox state of at least one species and or formation and or breaking of at least one chemical bond by the application of an electric current. Electrolysis of water can involve splitting water into oxygen gas and hydrogen gas or oxygen gas and another hydrogen containing species or hydrogen gas and another oxygen containing species or a combination. Photoelectrolysis utilizes electromagnetic radiation to drive an otherwise non spontaneous chemical reaction. That is photoelectrolysis is the conversion of light into a current and then the division of a molecule using that current.

The term oxidation reduction reaction means a chemical reaction between two species involving the transfer of at least one electron from one species to the other species. This type of reaction is also referred to as a redox reaction. The oxidation portion of the reaction involves the loss of at least one electron by one of the species and the reduction portion involves the addition of at least one electron to the other species.

A non limiting example of a nanostructure which may be utilized in a photocatalytic reaction is illustrated in . illustrates nanostructure e.g. nanorod comprising first region and second region . In this non limiting embodiment the nanostructure comprising a bulk material having first region comprising an n type semiconductor material and second region comprising a p type semiconductor material. Upon exposure of electromagnetic radiation holes propagate to the n type semiconductor material as indicated by arrow and electrons propagate to the p type semiconductor material as indicated by arrow as shown in . The holes in the n type semiconductor material may be used for an oxidation reaction for example the production of oxygen gas from water as indicated by arrow in and the electrons in the p type semiconductor material may be used for a reduction reaction for example the production of hydrogen gas from water as indicated by arrow in . Other suitable reduction reactions include the formation of H2 the reduction of CO2 the reduction of N2 and the like.

As noted above in some embodiments a bulk material may comprise two or more regions having different compositions. As used herein regions differing in composition may comprise different materials or elements phases or crystallographic orientations or other structural differences so as to provide different behavior or they may comprise the same materials or elements but at different ratios or concentrations. Each region may be of any size or shape within the bulk material. As an Example illustrates bulk material e.g. nanorod having first region and second region of approximately equal lengths and sizes wherein the junction between the first and second region is abrupt. illustrates bulk material e.g. nanorod having a first region and second region having different sizes and lengths wherein the junction between the first region and the second region is abrupt. illustrates bulk material e.g. nanorod having a gradual change between first region and second region . In embodiments where two regions are present generally the first region and the second region are in physical contact with one another. It should be understood however that in some embodiments a bulk material may comprise more than two regions. For example the first region and the second region may be separated by a third region wherein the third region comprises a material e.g. a conductive material which allows for electrical communication between the first region and the second region. For example as illustrated in bulk material e.g. nanorod comprises first region second region and third region . In yet another embodiment the bulk material may comprise a plurality of regions e.g. in the case of a multi junction semiconductor substrate . For example as illustrated in bulk material e.g. nanorod comprises a multi junction layout e.g. multi junction or triple junction silicon where areas comprise an n type semiconductor material areas comprise a i type semiconductor material and areas comprise a p type semiconductor material.

In some embodiments the bulk material comprises a semiconductor material. In some embodiments the bulk material comprises a single or substantially uniform semiconductor material. In some embodiments the bulk material comprise more than one type of semiconductor material. For example in some cases the first region of a bulk material comprises a first type of semiconductor material and the second region of a bulk material comprises a second type of semiconductor material. In some cases the first type of semiconductor material and the second type of semiconductor material comprise similar types of semiconductor materials but the first region comprises the semiconductor material which has been n doped and the second region comprises the semiconductor material which has been p doped. In some cases the first type of semiconductor material and the second type of semiconductor materials are different e.g. are not an n type doped and a p typed doped version of a single semiconductor material . In either case the materials may be selected such that a junction e.g. a heterojunction or a p n junction as described herein is formed between the first region and the second region.

Junctions may form between two or more different semiconductor materials of a bulk material. In one set of embodiments the junction is a p n junction wherein the bulk material is provided comprising a first region and a second region wherein the first region comprises an n type semiconductor material and the second region comprises a p type semiconductor material. That is the bulk material comprises a semiconductor material wherein a first portion of the semiconductor material is doped with an n type element and a second portion of the semiconductor material is doped with a p type element material. Doping is described in more detail herein. In some cases the nanostructure comprises two different semiconductor materials and a heterojunction is formed. Other non limiting examples of junctions are p p junctions n n junctions p i junctions where i refers to an intrinsic semiconductor n i junctions i i junctions and the like.

In certain embodiments of the invention bulk material having more than one junction between two regions having different compositions are also contemplated. For example a nanostructure may have 2 3 4 or more overlap regions. The number of periods and the repeat spacing may be constant or varied during growth. For example in some embodiments the bulk semiconductor material comprises a multiple junctions for example a triple junction. In a particular embodiment the bulk material comprises a triple junction silicon nanostructure e.g. nanorod . Multi junction materials will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

The regions of the bulk material may be distinct from each other with minimal cross contamination or the composition of the bulk material may vary gradually from one region to the next. The regions may be both longitudinally arranged relative to each other or radially arranged e.g. as in a core shell arrangement on the bulk material.

In some embodiments the junction between two differing regions may be atomically abrupt where there is a sharp transition at the atomic scale between two adjacent regions that differ in composition. However in other embodiments the junction between two differing regions may be more gradual. For example the overlap region between the adjacent regions can comprise a few nanometers wide for example less than about 10 nm less than about 20 nm less than about 40 nm less than about 50 nm less than about 100 nm or less than about 500 nm. In certain embodiments the overlap region between a first region having a composition and a second region having a composition different from the first region i.e. different concentrations or different species can be defined as the distance between where the composition of the overlap region ranges between about 10 vol and about 90 vol of the composition of the first region with the remainder having a complementary amount of the composition of the second region.

Semiconductor materials will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Non limiting examples of semiconductor materials include TiO WO SrTiO TiO Si BaTiO LaCrO TiO LaCrO RuO TiO InO GaAs GaP p GaAs n GaAs pGaInP AlGaAs SiRuO PbO FeTiO KTaO MnTiO SnO BiO FeO including hematite ZnO CdS MoS CdTe CdSe CdZnTe ZnTe HgTe HgZnTe HgSe ZnTe ZnS HgCdTe HgZnSe Si etc. or composites thereof. The semiconductor material may be provided in any suitable morphology or arrangement. In some embodiments the semiconductor material is a metal oxide and or metal hydroxide. In some cases the semiconductor material is not silicon oxide and or hydroxide. In some embodiments the semiconductor material is an iron oxide and or iron hydroxide. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of methods and techniques for preparing a bulk material in a chosen form and methods are described herein

In some cases a semiconductor material may be doped. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art doping refers to the process of introducing impurities into a pure semiconductor to change its electrical and or physical properties. In some embodiments each region of the bulk material e.g. nanorod may be doped or essentially undoped i.e. the region of the bulk material e.g. nanorod does not contain dopant at a concentration that is sufficient to produce a significant fraction of the charge carriers within the bulk material e.g. nanorod . For example a dopant may be present in an essentially undoped amount such that about 80 about 90 about 95 or nearly 100 of the charge carriers within the bulk material e.g. nanorod do not arise from dopant. In some cases there are no dopants present in a region of a bulk material e.g. nanorod at a detectable level. If a dopant is present the dopant may be for example a solid solution of various elemental semiconductors. In some cases a dopant is present in an amount of or in an amount of at least about 1 atom about 2 atom about 3 atom about 4 atom about 5 atom about 10 atom about 20 atom about 30 atom .

In some cases a semiconductor material may be doped with an n type element where the n type element is capable of providing extra conduction electrons to the host material. In some cases a semiconductor material may be doped with a p type element wherein the p type element is capable of increasing the number of free charge carriers in the semiconductor material. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select appropriate dopants based upon the desired semiconductor properties. For example TiOmay be doped with Y V Mo Cr Cu Al Ta B Ru Mn Fe Li Nb In Pb Ge C N S Si etc.

In some embodiments the dopant or the semiconductor may include mixtures of Group IV elements for example a mixture of silicon and carbon or a mixture of silicon and germanium. In other embodiments the dopant or the semiconductor may include a mixture of a Group III and a Group V element for example BN BP BAs MN AlP AlAs AlSb GaN GaP GaAs GaSb InN InP InAs or InSb. Mixtures of these may also be used for example a mixture of BN BP BAs or BN AlP. In other embodiments the dopants may include alloys of Group III and Group V elements. For example the alloys may include a mixture of AlGaN GaPAs InPAs GaInN AlGaInN GaInAsP or the like. In other embodiments the dopants may also include a mixture of Group II and Group VI semiconductors. For example the semiconductor may include ZnO ZnS ZnSe ZnTe CdS CdSe CdTe HgS HgSe HgTe BeS BeSe BeTe MgS MgSe or the like. Alloys or mixtures of these dopants are also possible for example ZnCd Se or Zn SSe or the like. Additionally alloys of different groups of semiconductors may also be possible for example a combination of a Group II Group VI and a Group III Group V semiconductor for example GaAs ZnS . Other examples of dopants may include combinations of Group IV and Group VI elements such as GeS GeSe GeTe SnS SnSe SnTe PbO PbS PbSe or PbTe. Other semiconductor mixtures may include a combination of a Group I and a Group VII such as CuF CuCl CuBr Cut AgF AgCl AgBr AgI or the like.

For Group IV dopant materials a p type dopant may be selected from Group III and an n type dopant may be selected from Group V for example. For silicon semiconductor materials a p type dopant may be selected from the group consisting of B Al and In and an n type dopant may be selected from the group consisting of P As and Sb. For Group III Group V semiconductor materials a p type dopant may be selected from Group II including Mg Zn Cd and Hg or Group IV including C and Si. An n type dopant may be selected from the group consisting of Si Ge Sn S Se and Te. It will be understood that the invention is not limited to these dopants but may include other elements alloys or materials as well.

In an exemplary embodiment a bulk material or nanostructure of the present invention comprises iron oxide e.g. FeO . In a particular embodiment the iron oxide may be alpha FeO also known as hematite. The iron oxide may comprise a first region and a second region. For example a nanostructure may comprise a first region comprising an n type iron oxide and a second region comprising a p type iron oxide. For example the first region may comprise iron oxide doped with Ta Zr In Sb or Si etc. and the second region may comprise iron oxide doped with Mg Ca Ti Mn Co Ni Sn or Zn etc.

In some cases a semiconductor material may be selected to have an appropriate band gap. As will be know to those of ordinary skill in the art if a band gap of a semiconductor material is too small the semiconductor may be unstable. On the other hand if the band gap is too large the semiconductor may not be capable of efficiently absorbing light energy. Accordingly in some cases the band gap of the semiconductor material s may be selected such that the material s advantageously absorb s a sufficient fraction of solar energy. The semiconductor materials may be selected such that the band gap is between about 1.0 eV and about 3.0 eV between about 1.0 eV and about 2.5 eV between about 1.5 eV and about 2.5 eV between about 1.7 eV and about 2.3 eV between about 1.8 eV and about 2.2 eV between about 1.2 and about 1.8 eV between about 1.4 and about 1.8 eV between about 1.5 and about 1.7 eV or is about 2.0 eV. In some cases the bad gap is less than about 2.0 eV.

As will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art the band gap of a material is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. If a photon has energy greater than or equal to the band gap of the material then electrons can form in the conduction band and holes can form in the valence band related by the following Equation 1 1 where h is Planck s constant v is the frequency of the photon e is an electron and h is an electron hole. In many instances without an electric field or bias e.g. provided through doping of the semiconductor material and or through the application of an external voltage the electron and the hole may recombine. Advantageously many embodiments of the present invention avoid this challenging problem as described herein for example through use of catalytic materials. For example the use of catalytic material s may reduce the number of holes and electrons that recombine prior to participation in a reaction.

In some embodiments the process that takes place at a first region is shown in Equation 2. 4 HO liquid or gas O gas 4H 2 The process shown in Equation 2 in some cases may take place at the first region e.g. comprising an n type semiconductor material . This process produces oxygen gas which may be released stored and or used in various systems methods. The electrons and the hydrogen ions may combine at the second region e.g. comprising a p type semiconductor material to form hydrogen gas as shown in Equation 3. 2H 2 H gas 3 The overall reaction that takes place is shown in Equation 4. 4 HO liquid or gas O gas 2H gas 4 The overall reaction can occur if the energy of the photons absorbed by the first electrode is equal to or greater than the electric potential difference for the reaction E E E where Eand Eare the standard reduction potentials for the reduction and oxidation half reactions respectively . Half reactions of interest e.g. reactions which may be carried out using the methods and systems described herein along with their standard reduction potential relative to the normal hydrogen electrode NHE are listed below 

In some cases the semiconductor materials comprised in the bulk material may be selected at least in part according to the energy levels of the conduction and valence bands. For example in some embodiments the energy level of valence band of the first region is selected to be less positive than the energy level of the valence band of the second region the semiconductor material comprising the first region may be selected such that its valence band potential is more positive than the reduction potential for oxidation half reaction the energy level of the conduction band of the first region may be selected to be more negative than the energy level of the conduction band of the second region and or the semiconductor material comprising the second region may be selected such that its conduction band potential is more negative than the reduction potential for the desired reduction half reaction at the given pH e.g. the evolution of hydrogen from water the evolution of carbon monoxide and or hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide the evolution of ammonia from nitrogen .

A semiconductor material may be transparent substantially transparent substantially opaque or opaque. A semiconductor material may be a solid semi solid semi porous or porous.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of methods for forming a bulk material e.g. for a nanostructure comprising at least a first region and a second region. For example a nanostructure bulk material e.g. a nanorod may be grown in sequential fashion with the appropriate p type dopant followed by the appropriate n type dopant thereby forming a nanostructure with a p n junction within the nanostructure. In certain embodiments a nanostructure bulk material e.g. nanorod may be produced using techniques that allow for direct and controlled growth of the nanostructure. Techniques for forming nanostructure bulk material include but are not limited to direct fabrication of nanostructure bulk materials comprising heterojunctions during synthesis or doping of nanostructure bulk materials via post synthesis techniques e.g. annealing of dopants from contacts or solution processing techniques . A p n junction may be formed during synthesis by changing the dopant at any point during the growth of the nanostructure bulk material whereas a heterojunction may be formed during synthesis by changing the materials being employed for the growth of the nanostructure bulk material.

In various aspects a method of preparing a bulk material e.g. for a nanostructure may utilize metal catalyzed CVD techniques chemical vapor deposition . CVD synthetic procedures useful for preparing individual wires directly on surfaces and in bulk form are generally known and can readily be carried out by those of ordinary skill in the art. Nanowires or nanorods may also be grown through laser catalytic growth. With the same basic principles as laser catalytic growth LCG described herein if uniform diameter nanoclusters less than 10 to 20 variation depending on how uniform the nanoclusters are are used as the catalytic cluster nanowires or nanorods with uniform size diameter distribution can be produced where the diameter of the wires or rods is determined by the size of the catalytic clusters. By controlling growth time nanowires or nanorods with different lengths can be grown.

In some cases a bulk material e.g. for a nanostructure may be formed using catalytic chemical vapor deposition C CVD . In C CVD reactant molecules are formed from the vapor phase. If doping is desired the nanostructure bulk material may be doped by introducing the doping element into the vapor phase reactant. The doping concentration may be controlled by controlling the relative amount of the doping compound introduced in the composite target. The final doping concentration or ratios are not necessarily the same as the vapor phase concentration or ratios. By controlling growth conditions such as temperature pressure or the like nanostructures having the same doping concentration may be produced.

To produce a bulk material e.g. for a nanostructure having adjacent regions with different compositions within the nanostructure bulk material the ratio of gas reactant may be varied e.g. from about 1 ppm to about 10 from about 10 ppm to about 20 from about 100 ppm to about 50 or the like and or the types of gas reactants used may be altered during growth of the nanostructure bulk material e.g. to form a second differing semiconductor material or to change from an n type dopant to a p type dopant or vice versa . The gas reactant ratio or the type of gas reactants used may be altered several times during growth of the nanostructure bulk material which may produce the nanostructure bulk material comprising regions having multiple compositions all of which may or may not be unique.

In some embodiments a bulk material e.g. for a nanostructure may be formed using laser catalytic growth LCG . In LCG reactants and or dopants are controllably introduced during vapor phase growth of nanostructure bulk materials. Laser vaporization of a composite target composed of a desired material and a catalytic material e.g. catalytic cluster may create a hot dense vapor. The vapor may condense into liquid nanostructure bulk materials through collision with a buffer gas. Growth may begin when the liquid nanostructure bulk materials become supersaturated with the desired phase and can continue as long as reactant is available. Growth may terminate when the nanostructure bulk material passes out of the hot reaction zone and or when the temperature is decreased. The nanostructure bulk material wire may be further subjected to different semiconductor reagents during growth.

In LCG vapor phase semiconductor reactants required for nanostructure bulk material growth may be produced by laser ablation of solid targets vapor phase molecular species or the like. To create a junction within a nanostructure bulk material the addition of the one or more of the first provided reactants may be stopped during growth and then a one or more second provided reactants may be introduced.

The catalytic clusters or the vapor phase reactants may be produced by any suitable technique. For example laser ablation techniques may be used to generate catalytic clusters or vapor phase reactant that may be used during LCG. Other techniques may also be contemplated such as thermal evaporation techniques. The laser ablation technique may generate liquid nanoclusters that may subsequently define the size and direct the growth direction of the nanoscopic wires. The diameters of the resulting nanostructure bulk materials may be determined by the size of the catalyst cluster which in turn may be determined using routine experiments that vary the growth conditions such as background pressure temperature flow rate of reactants and the like. For example lower pressure generally produces nanowires or nanorods with smaller diameters. Further diameter control may be achieved by using uniform diameter catalytic clusters.

In some cases a bulk material e.g. for a nanostructure may be formed using a nanostructure forming catalyst e.g. different from the catalytic materials described herein which may be associated with a nanostructure . A nanostructure forming catalyst can be for example gold or a gold containing material in certain embodiments. A wide range of other nanostructure forming catalysts may also be contemplated for forming a nanostructure bulk material for example a transition metal such as silver copper zinc cadmium iron nickel cobalt and the like. Generally any metal able to form an alloy with the desired semiconductor material but does not form a more stable compound than with the elements of the desired semiconductor material may be used as the catalyst. The buffer gas may be any inert gas for example Nor a noble gas such as argon. In some embodiments a mixture of Hand a buffer gas may be used to reduce undesired oxidation by residual oxygen gas. A reactive gas used during the synthesis of the nanostructure bulk material may also be introduced when desired for example ammonia for semiconductors containing nitrogen such as gallium nitride. Nanostructure bulk materials may also be flexibly doped by introducing one or more dopants into the composite target. The doping concentration may be controlled by controlling the relative amount of doping element for example between 0 and about 10 or about 20 introduced in the composite target.

Other techniques to produce bulk materials e.g. for a nanostructure of the invention are also contemplated. For example nanostructure bulk materials of any of a variety of materials may be grown directly from vapor phase through a vapor solid process. Also nanostructure bulk materials may also be produced by deposition on the edge of surface steps or other types of patterned surfaces. Further nanostructure bulk materials may be grown by vapor deposition in or on any generally elongated template. The porous membrane may be porous silicon anodic alumina a diblock copolymer or any other similar structure. The natural fiber may be DNA molecules protein molecules carbon nanotubes any other elongated structures. For all the above described techniques the source materials may be a solution or a vapor. In some cases while in solution phase the template may also include be column micelles formed by surfactant. In yet another embodiment a nanostructure bulk material may be formed using supercritical fluid phase inclusion techniques see for example Crowley et al. Chem. Mater. 2003 14 3518 . In some cases a metal oxides and or metal hydroxides can be formed by the oxidation and or hydrolysis of a metal containing compound. In a particular embodiment a doped iron oxide can be formed by the oxidation and or hydrolysis of an iron containing compound in the presence of a dopant.

In some embodiments a semiconductor material e.g. for a nanostructure may be doped after formation e.g. of the nanostructure . In one technique a nanostructure bulk material having a substantially homogeneous composition is first synthesized then is doped post synthetically with various dopants. Such doping may occur throughout the entire nanostructure bulk material or in one or more portions of the nanostructure bulk material for example in a nanowire or nanorod having multiple regions differing in composition.

In some embodiments a nanostructure comprises at least one surface presenting catalytic material which is compositional different than the bulk material e.g. a semiconductor material . In some cases a first catalytic material is associated with a first region of a bulk and a second catalytic material is associated with a second region of the bulk wherein the first type and the second type of catalytic materials are compositionally different than the bulk material s . Association of at least one surface presenting catalytic material with the first and or second region of a bulk material may aid in the photocatalytic reaction. For example the association of at least one surface presenting catalytic material with the bulk material may increase the efficiency of the photocatalysis. As will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art a challenge associated with the use of semiconductor materials is that the charge separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes may not be long lived. That is the electrons may diffuse back into the semiconductor to recombine with a hole within a time frame faster than what is needed for the electrochemical reaction to proceed. Accordingly association of at least one catalytic material may increase the efficiency of the photocatalysis by allowing for rapid reaction between the photoexcited electron and or electron hole with the bulk.

In some embodiments a nanostructure of the present invention comprises a bulk material e.g. comprising one or more semiconductor material and at least one surface presenting catalytic material e.g. which is compositionally different than the bulk material . In some cases a first type of surface presenting catalytic material is associated with a first region of the bulk material and a second type of surface presenting catalytic material is associated with a second region of the bulk material. In some cases the surface presenting catalytic material is a catalytic material. Many species of the class of catalytic material provided by the invention are made of readily available low cost material and are simple to make and non limiting examples are described herein.

A catalytic material as used herein means a material that is involved in and increases the rate of a chemical reaction but is largely unconsumed by the reaction itself and may participate in multiple chemical transformations. A catalytic material may also be referred to as a catalyst and or a catalyst composition. A catalytic material is generally not simply a bulk semiconductor material. For example a catalytic material might involve a metal center which undergoes a change from one oxidation state to another during the catalytic process. In another example the catalytic material might involve metal ionic species which bind to one or more oxygen atoms from water and release the oxygen atoms as dioxygen i.e. O . Thus catalytic material is given its ordinary meaning in the field in connection with this invention. As will be understood from other descriptions herein a catalytic material of the invention that may be consumed in slight quantities during some uses and may be in many embodiments regenerated to its original chemical state. In some cases a catalytic material upon oxidation catalyzed an oxidation reaction and in other cases a catalytic material upon reduction catalyzes a reduction reaction.

In some embodiments methods are provided for forming a nanostructure comprising a bulk material e.g. comprising a first region and a second region and at least one surface presenting catalytic material associated with at least the first region and or the second region. In some embodiments the nanostructure comprising at least one surface presenting catalytic material may be formed by exposing a bulk material e.g. comprising a semiconductor material having a first region and a second region to a solution comprising metal ionic species and anionic species followed by exposing the bulk material to electromagnetic radiation thereby forming at least a first surface presenting catalytic material associated with the first region of the bulk and or at least a second surface presenting catalytic material associated with the second region of the bulk. The metal ionic species and anionic species may associate with the bulk and form a composition e.g. a catalytic material associated with the bulk thereby forming a nanostructure.

In some embodiments a first catalytic material associates with a first region of a bulk and a second catalytic material associates with a second region of the bulk substantially simultaneously. Substantially simultaneously when used in connection with the formation of a first catalytic material and the second catalytic material means that the catalytic materials associate with the bulk during the same period but does not necessarily mean that the catalytic materials form in the same quantity or quality. For example a greater amount of the first catalytic material may associate with the first region of the bulk as compared to the amount of second catalytic material which associates with the second region of the semiconductor material a lesser amount of the first catalytic material may associate with the first region of the bulk as compared to the amount of second catalytic material which associates with the second region of the bulk.

It should be understood that while a bulk may comprise a first region and a second region e.g. a first material and a second material the catalytic material may not necessarily be associated with all portions of the first region and the second region. For example the first catalytic material may associate with only a portion of the first region. In some cases however the catalytic material may associate with essentially the entire first region. In some cases the association occurs at the surface of the material. In some cases if the material is porous the catalytic material may form in the pores of the material.

The formation of the catalytic material s associated with a bulk comprising a semiconductor material will now be described in more detail. Catalytic materials are known which associate with a semiconductor material upon exposure of the semiconductor material to appropriate catalyst forming conditions to electromagnetic radiation. The invention provides methods for forming one or more catalytic material on a semiconductor substrate wherein the semiconductor substrate is in the form of a nanostructure.

As an example a semiconductor substrate e.g. a bulk material is provided comprising a first region comprising an n type semiconductor material and a second region comprising a p type semiconductor material. As described herein upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation the separation of holes and electrons may occur in the n type and p type semiconductor materials. The holes in the n type material may be used for the formation of a first catalytic material and the electrons in the p type material may be used for the formation of the second catalytic material. The catalytic materials may aid in an oxidation and or reduction reaction of an electrochemical reaction.

In some cases surface presenting catalytic materials may form as follows. A semiconductor substrate e.g. a bulk material comprising a first region and a second region can be exposed to a solution comprising at least one metal ionic species and at least one anionic species. Upon exposure of the semiconductor substrate to electromagnetic radiation at the first region e.g. n type region the metal ionic species may be oxidized from an oxidation state of n to an oxidation state greater than n and a catalytic material comprising the metal ionic species in an oxidation state greater than n may associated with the first region. The first catalytic material may addition comprise anionic species. Similarly at the second region e.g. p type region the metal ionic species may be reduced from an oxidation state of n to an oxidation state less than n e.g. 0 and a catalytic material comprising the metal ionic species in an oxidation state less than n may then associate with the second region. In another set of embodiments a similar protocol can be carried out but instead of driving the formation of the nanostructures catalytic regions with electromagnetic radiation or in addition to the use of electromagnetic radiation a chemical reaction and or a change in the chemical and or physical environment can be used to drive formation. E.g. a change in pH temperature and or the like of an environment to which e.g. a solution in which the nanoparticles are exposed addition of reaction driving constituents etc. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select reactants and or conditions to drive such reactions with aid of the present disclosure.

A non limiting example of a method of forming a first and or second catalytic material associated with a semiconductor substrate e.g. a bulk material comprising a first region and a second region is illustrated in . Semiconductor substrate comprising first region and second region is provided wherein first region comprises an n type semiconductor material and second region comprises a p type semiconductor material. The semiconductor substrate is immersed in a solution comprising metal ionic species grey circles having an oxidation state of n and anionic species white circles . Upon exposure of semiconductor substrate to electromagnetic radiation holes propagate to the n type material as indicated by arrow and electrons propagate to the p type material as indicated by arrow as illustrated in . The holes in the n type material may aid in the formation of and or association of first catalytic material comprising the metal ionic species dashed circles in an oxidation state greater than n and the anionic species white circles with first region and the electrons in the p type material may aid in the formation of and or association of second catalytic material comprising metal ionic species dotted circles having an oxidation state less than n to with second region as illustrated in . Following formation of the catalytic materials and upon further exposure of the nanostructure to electromagnetic radiation the first catalytic material in combination with the holes present in the n type material may aid in an oxidation reaction for example the production of oxygen gas from water as indicated by arrow in and the second catalytic material in combination with the electrons present in the p type material may aid in a reduction reaction for example the production of hydrogen gas from water as indicated by arrow in .

A catalytic material associated with a semiconductor substrate e.g. a bulk material will now be described with reference to a metal ionic species and or anionic species which can define a catalytic material of the invention. In some cases the anionic species and the metal ionic species may interact with each other prior to simultaneously to and or after the association of the species with the semiconductor substrate and result in a catalytic material with a high degree of solid content resident on or otherwise immobilized with respect to the semiconductor substrate. In this arrangement the catalytic material can be solid including various degrees of electrolyte or solution e.g. the material can be hydrated with various amounts of water and or other species fillers or the like but a unifying feature among such catalytic material associated with semiconductor substrate is that they can be observed visually or through other techniques described more fully below as largely resident on or immobilized with respect to the semiconductor substrate either in electrolyte solution or after removal of the semiconductor substrate from solution.

In some cases the catalytic material may associate with a semiconductor substrate via formation of a bond such as an ionic bond a covalent bond e.g. carbon carbon carbon oxygen oxygen silicon sulfur sulfur phosphorus nitrogen carbon nitrogen metal oxygen or other covalent bonds a hydrogen bond e.g. between hydroxyl amine carboxyl thiol and or similar functional groups a dative bond e.g. complexation or chelation between metal ions and monodentate or multidentate ligands Van der Waals interactions and the like. Association of the composition e.g. catalytic material with the semiconductor substrate would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art based on this description. In some embodiments the interaction between a metal ionic species and an anionic species may comprise an ionic interaction wherein the metal ionic species is directly bound to other species and the anionic species is a counterion not directly bound to the metal ionic species. In a specific embodiment an anionic species and a metal ionic species form an ionic bond and the complex formed is a salt.

A catalytic material associated with a bulk may be most often arranged with respect to the bulk so that it is in sufficient electrical communication with the bulk to carry out purposes of the invention as described herein. Electrical communication as used herein is given its ordinary meaning as would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art whereby electrons can flow between the bulk and the catalytic material in a facile enough manner for the bulk to operate as described herein. That is charge may be transferred between the bulk and the catalytic material e.g. the metal ionic species and or anionic species present in the catalytic material . In one arrangement the composition is in direct contact with the bulk. In another arrangement a material may be present between the composition and the bulk e.g. a shell as described herein an insulator a conducting material etc. .

In some cases a surface presenting catalytic material may be in direct electrical communication with the bulk. Direct electrical communication as used herein is given its ordinary meaning as defined above with respect to electrical communication but in this instance the bulk and the surface presenting catalytic material are in direct contact with one another e.g. as opposed to through a secondary material through use of circuitry etc. . In some embodiments the bulk and the surface presenting catalytic material may be integrally connected. The term integrally connected when referring to two or more objects means objects that do not become separated from each other during the course of normal use e.g. separation requires at least the use of tools and or by causing damage to at least one of the components for example by breaking peeling dissolving etc. A surface presenting catalytic material may be considered to be in direct electrical communication with a bulk material during operation of a nanostructure even in instances where a portion of the surface presenting catalytic material may dissociate from the photoactive composition when taking part in a dynamic equilibrium.

Without wishing to be bound by theory the formation of a catalytic material on a bulk material e.g. comprising a semiconductor material wherein the catalytic material comprising metal ionic species in an oxidation state greater than the oxidation state in solution may proceed according to the following example. The bulk e.g. a plurality of nanorods each comprising at least one semiconductor material may be immersed in a solution comprising metal ionic species M with an oxidation state of n e.g. M and anionic species e.g. A . The bulk e.g. the plurality of nanorods may be exposed to electromagnetic radiation and metal ionic species near to the bulk material or nanostructure may be oxidized to an oxidation state of n x e.g. M . The oxidized metal ionic species may interact with an anionic species near the bulk material or nanostructure nanostructure to form a substantially insoluble complex thereby forming a catalytic material. In some cases the catalytic material may be in electrical communication with the bulk material.

A non limiting example of this process is depicted in . shows a single metal ionic species with an oxidation state of n in solution . Metal ionic species may be near bulk e.g. nanorod as depicted in . As shown in metal ionic species may be oxidized to an oxidized metal ionic species with an oxidation state of n x and x electrons may be transferred to bulk or to another species near or associated with the metal ionic species and or the bulk. depicts a single anionic species nearing oxidized metal ionic species . In some instances as depicted in anionic species and oxidized metal ionic species may associate with bulk to form a catalytic material. In some instances the oxidized metal ionic species and the anionic species may interact and form a complex e.g. a salt before associating with the bulk. In other instances the metal ionic species and anionic species may associate with each other prior to oxidation of the metal ionic species. In other instances the oxidized metal ionic species and or anionic species may associate directly with the bulk and or with another species already associated with the bulk. In these instances the metal ionic species and or anionic species may associate with the bulk either directly or via formation of a complex to form the catalytic material e.g. a composition associated with the bulk .

Similarly the formation of a catalytic material on a semiconductor substrate e.g. a nanorod comprising a least one semiconductor material wherein the catalytic material comprising metal ionic species in an oxidation state less than the oxidation state in solution may proceed according to the following example. A semiconductor substrate may be immersed in a solution comprising metal ionic species M with an oxidation state of n e.g. M . The semiconductor substrate may be exposed to electromagnetic radiation and metal ionic species near to the semiconductor substrate may be reduced to an oxidation state of n w e.g. M . The reduced metal ionic species may thereby form a catalytic material associated with the semiconductor substrate. In some cases the catalytic material may be in electrical communication with the semiconductor substrate. In some cases the catalytic material may comprise species in addition to the reduced metal species.

The selection of appropriate metal ionic species and anionic species will now be discussed in more detail. It should be understood that while much of the discussion herein focuses on a first catalytic material and a second catalytic material comprising the same metal species in different oxidation states this is by no means limiting and in some cases the first catalytic material and the second catalytic material can comprise different metal species. For example a first catalytic material may comprise cobalt in an oxidation state of II III and or IV and the second catalytic material may comprise nickel in an oxidation state of 0 . Formation of two catalytic material comprises different metal species may be accomplished by exposing a semiconductor substrate e.g. a nanorod comprising at least one semiconductor material to more than one type of metal ionic species e.g. Co II and Ni II . In such embodiments the first catalytic material may comprise the first metal species e.g. Co III and or Co IV in an oxidation state greater than the oxidation state of the first metal species in solution and the second catalytic material may comprise the second type of metal species e.g. Ni 0 in an oxidation state less than the oxidation state of the second metal species in solution. In some cases the first catalytic material may comprise a first metal species and the second catalytic material may comprise the first metal species and a second metal species. For example the first catalytic material may comprise Ni e.g. in an oxidation state of II and or III and the second catalytic material may comprise Ni e.g. in an oxidation state of 0 and molybdenum e.g. in an oxidation state of 0 .

In some cases the metal ionic species is chosen and presented in an oxidation state such that both lower and higher oxidation states are available. For example Co II may be provided wherein cobalt has access to lower oxidation states e.g. Co 0 and higher oxidation states e.g. Co III Co IV . In some cases the metal ionic species is selected such that it capable of forming a first catalytic material comprising the anionic species according to the methods guidelines and parameters described elsewhere e.g. see U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

In some embodiments the metal ionic species M and the anionic species A may be selected such that they exhibit the following properties in connection with forming a catalytic material wherein the oxidation state of the metal ionic species is greater than the oxidation state of the metal ionic species in solution. Without wishing to be bound by theory the solubility of a material comprising anionic species and oxidized metal ionic species may influence the association of the metal ionic species and or anionic species with the current collector. For example if a material formed by c number of anionic species and b number of oxidized metal ionic species is substantially insoluble in the solution the material may be influenced to associate with the current collector. This non limiting example may be expressed according to Equation 9 M A M A s 9 where Mis the oxidized metal ionic species Ais the anionic species and M A is at least a portion of catalytic material formed where b and c are the number of metal ionic species and anionic species respectively. It should be understood however that the catalytic material does not necessarily consist essentially of a material defined by the formula M A as in most cases additional components can be present in the catalytic material e.g. a second type of anionic species .

In some embodiments the solution may consist of or consist essentially of water i.e. be essentially pure water or an aqueous solution that behaves essentially identical to pure water in each case with the minimum electrical conductivity necessary for an electrochemical system to function. In some embodiments the solution may be selected such that the metal ionic species and the anionic species used for forming catalytic materials are substantially soluble. In some cases when the nanostructure is to be used in a system immediately after formation the solution may be selected such that it comprises water or other fuel to be oxidized by a system and or method as described herein.

In some cases a composition is provided comprising a plurality of nanostructures of the invention. In some cases the plurality of nanostructure comprise individual nanostructures. As used herein individual nanostructure means a nanostructure free or essentially free of contact with another nanostructure but not excluding contact of a type that may be desired between individual nanostructures e.g. as in a crossbar array . For example an individual or a free standing article may at some point in its life not be attached to another article for example with another nanostructure or the free standing article may be in solution. This is in contrast to nanotubes produced primarily by laser vaporization techniques that produce materials formed as ropes. This is also in contrast to conductive portions of articles which differ from surrounding material only by having been altered chemically or physically in situ i.e. where a portion of a uniform article is made different from its surroundings by selective doping etching etc. An individual or a free standing article is one that can be but need not be removed from the location where it is made as an individual article and transported to a different location and combined with different components to make a functional system such as those described herein and those that would be contemplated by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading this disclosure.

The nanostructures of the present invention may be of any size or shape. In some embodiments a nanostructure is a nanowire or a nanorod.

In some embodiments a nanostructure is a nanoparticle. The term nanoparticle generally refers to a particle having a maximum cross sectional dimension of no more than 1 micron. Nanoparticles are generally spherical in shape though other shapes are also possible.

In some cases however the size of the nanostructures may be selected such that the nanostructures generally remain suspended in solution e.g. do not settle based upon solution mechanics and or properties. In some cases the nanostructures have a maximum dimension of less than 200 nm thereby promoting the nanostructures to remain suspended in solution. In some cases the nanostructures are nanorods having an average length of less than about 200 nm less than about 150 nm less than about 100 nm or less.

In some aspects of the present invention methods of using a nanostructure for photochemical reaction are provided.

In some embodiments the nanostructures comprise metal oxides.

In a particular embodiment the photochemical reaction is water splitting wherein oxygen and hydrogen gases are produced from water. In some cases the nanostructure comprises a heterojunction e.g. between two differing semiconductor materials with appropriate band gaps and or a p n junction . In the case of a nanostructure comprising a p n junction electrons which are excited in the nanostructure upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation can travel to the p type region of the nanostructure where they can be used to reduce protons to hydrogen. Similarly formed electron holes can travel to the n type region of the nanostructure where they can be used to oxidize water to oxygen.

It will be understood that substituted also includes that the substitution results in a stable compound e.g. which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement cyclization elimination etc. In some cases substituted may generally refer to replacement of a hydrogen with a substituent as described herein. However substituted as used herein does not encompass replacement and or alteration of a key functional group by which a molecule is identified e.g. such that the substituted functional group becomes through substitution a different functional group.

In some embodiments a user may employ a single reactor compartment container or chamber. The systems may include a photocatalyst adapted to catalytically evolve Hand Ofrom water under illumination a container capable of containing H and a separator system adapted to separate Hfrom a mixture comprising at least Hand O.

Such reactors use water as a substrate for Hand Oproduction. The water need not be perfectly pure as the water may include salt minerals or other impurities. Sea water may be used as well as lake stream river and rain water. Purified water may be used but purified water is not a requirement. The water may even be waste water and may include a supporting electrolyte e.g. salts of hydroxide chloride sulfate phosphate borate nitrate and mixtures thereof . The water may be liquid or gaseous form.

The systems also suitably include a photocatalyst material. The photocatalyst is suitably adapted to photocatalyze the evolution of Oand Hfrom water. The photocatalyst is suitably disposed within the water container. Suitable photocatalysts are described herein as well as in U.S. application 61 478 364 and in international application PCT US2009 005521 both of which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for any and all purposes. Photocatalysts suitably include a semiconductor a molecule a polymer a composite material a protein or other biomolecule or a biological organism e.g. bacteria or algae . Photocatalysts may be of various shapes and sizes e.g. rods spheres cubes tetrapods or irregular shapes and from 0.1 nm 1 cm or larger in size .

In some embodiments suitable photocatalysts may operate according to the following mechanism. In some embodiments a semiconductor particle may be in contact with water. Particles sizes may vary from less than 1 nm to about 1 nm 10 nm 5 nm 50 nm 20 nm 200 nm 100 nm 1 micro m and larger than 1 micro m. Upon excitation electrons are produced in the semiconductor conduction band and electron holes are produced in the semiconductor valence band. Electrons may then react with water to produce Hand the corresponding electron holes may react with water to produce O.

In embodiments where a nanostructure comprising a first region and a second region is exposed to light charge separation may occur between the first region and the second region wherein an excess of electrons are present in the first region and an excess of holes are present in the second region. For example for a nanostructure comprising a first region defining primarily or exclusively a first semiconductor material and a second region defining primarily or exclusively a second semiconductor material upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation electrons may be excited from the valence band to the conduction band in the first region e.g. comprising an n type semiconductor thereby creating holes in the valence band and free electrons in the conduction band. The excited electron and corresponding electron hole may separate spatially within the n type semiconductor material from the point of generation. The electrons produced at the first region may be transported e.g. via the nanostructure material to the second region of the nanostructure e.g. comprising a p type semiconductor . The separated electron holes may be transported to a nanostructure electrolyte interface at each region where they may be used to carry out an electrochemical reaction e.g. a redox reaction. For example the holes electrons can react with a water molecule resulting in the formation of oxygen gas and or hydrogen ions. As another example the holes electrons can react with a halide ion e.g. Br alternatively in the form HBr resulting in the formation of halogen e.g. Br or Hand Br .

In some embodiments the combination of the nanostructure bulk any optional shell material and any surface presenting catalytic material if different from the bulk together defines a nanostructure that is at least somewhat non uniform with respect to semiconductor characteristic and or becomes at least somewhat non uniform upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation. For example in some embodiments the nanostructure comprises a semiconductor material with dopants which are primarily n type in nature in a first region and dopants which are primarily p type in nature in a second region. For example where the nanostructure is a nanorod one region e.g. end of the nanorod can exhibit more n type dopants with a second region e.g. the other end exhibiting more p type dopants. Further information concerning suitable photocatalysts may be found in U.S. application 61 478 364 and in international application PCT US2009 005521.

In some embodiments the semiconductor particle may be in contact with a co catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction HER and or the oxygen evolution reaction OER . Co catalysts may consist of one or more islands deposited on the surface of the semiconductor particle or may consists of uniform shells which coat the particle. Typical HER catalysts include metals and metal alloys such as Pt Pd Ni and Ni based alloys e.g. NiMo NiZn NiMoCd NiMoZn etc Co and Co based alloys e.g. CoMo CoZn CoMoCd CoMoZn etc Rh Re Ru MoS molecular catalysts enzymes and other biomolecules. Typical OER catalysts include metal oxides such as oxides of Ir e.g. IrO oxides of Ru e.g. RuO oxides of Ni e.g. NiO NiO OH oxides of Co e.g. CoO CoO OH mixed metal oxides e.g. NiFe and various perovskites and pyrochlores. Other OER catalysts may include mixed metal anionic species e.g. Co phosphate Co borate and Ni borate as described in the original MIT case molecular catalysts including coordination compounds and clusters of Ru and Ir enzymes and other biomolecules. Exemplary embodiments are described in U.S. application 61 478 364 and in international application PCT US2009 005521.

In some embodiments the photocatalyst may be dispersed in water . In this case the dispersion may be in the form of a colloidal suspension in which the particles do not settle out over a time e.g. 1 week . In other cases the dispersion may be a suspension of photocatalyst particles that readily settle from solution. In this case the dispersion may or may not be mixed. Mixing may be achieved through convection pumping or stirring of the fluid. Additionally or alternatively the system may include catalyst disposed on a surface of the container or compartment that contacts the water. The system may also include a catalyst support e.g. a porous medium on which the photocatalyst is deposited. Such embodiments allow the user to increase the contact between the photocatalyst and the water.

The reactors may also suitably include an apparatus material or system to collect gas e.g. hydrogen evolved within the system. The collector may be configured to contain gas at a given purity and if desired at a given pressure. Ranges for purity may be greater than 50 greater than 70 greater than 90 greater than 95 greater than 99 and the like. Ranges for pressure include greater than 0.5 atm of or about 1 atm greater than 1 atm greater than 10 atm greater than 100 atm greater than 1000 atm and the like.

The system may also include a gas purification apparatus. The apparatus may be used to separate Hand O. In some embodiments the Hand Oare present in a gaseous mixture. In this case the Hand Oare to have an initial and final molar ratio corresponding to the ratio of moles of Hto Obefore and after being processed by the gas purification apparatus. Initial ratios of H Omay be greater than 100 1 greater than 50 1 greater than 10 1 or about 2 1 or less than 1 10 less than 1 50 or less than 1 100. In other cases the Hand Omay be dissolved in solution or may consist of bubbles in solution e.g. during the generation of Hand Ofrom water .

In some cases the gas purification apparatus may contain an electrochemical device. This device may in some embodiments be a proton exchange membrane PEM fuel cell that is run in hydrogen pump mode to effect a selective transport of Hacross the PEM membrane. The anode electrode in the cell may be comprised of supported platinum catalyst and a hydrocarbon ionomer non PFSA ionomer. Such ionomers include aromatic structures with sulfonic acid functionalities such as sulfonated polysulfones and the like. These ionomers have the characteristic of low oxygen solubility which may aid in avoiding a combustible mixture being formed near the catalyst during the hydrogen pump. A gas diffusion medium may be impregnated with an oxygen absorbing material e.g fluoropolymer to further limit the diffusion of oxygen into the electrode. In addition to the above cells comprised of porous water transport bipolar plates e.g. as found in U.S. Pat. No. 6 723 461 may also be used to effectively bathe the electrode in water. This has the dual benefit of imparting high conductivity through high hydration and quenching thermal energy should hydrogen oxygen combustion occur over the catalyst due to both the high enthalpy of vaporization for water and the local dilution of the combustible mixture that would result.

The gas purification apparatus may also include a gas absorbing material. The gas absorbing material may have a higher affinity for oxygen in the presence of hydrogen deemed an oxygen absorbing material or a higher affinity for hydrogen in the presence of oxygen deemed an hydrogen absorbing material . Exemplary oxygen absorbing materials include those used in the separation of oxygen from air such as cyano complexes of cobalt cobalt salen complexes and suitable polymer based membranes. Other oxygen absorbing materials include globins e.g. hemoglobin myoglobin oxygen binding proteins and molecules and fluorinated polymers fluorocarbons . Exemplary hydrogen absorbing materials include metals e.g. Ni Pd Pt Li Mg and forms of carbon e.g. nanotubes . The gas absorbing material may be loaded and depleted of the desired gas through changes in temperature and or pressure. Such pressure and temperature swing processes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

In some cases the gas purification apparatus may separate hydrogen and oxygen through condensation. Because oxygen has a higher boiling point 90.15 K than hydrogen 20.28 K thus oxygen may be preferentially condensed as a liquid in the presence of hydrogen as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The condenser may in some embodiments be powered by a fuel cell that itself operates using hydrogen oxygen or both that is evolved from the photocatalysis of water.

The gas collection apparatus may comprise a containment vessel for the water and the photocatalyst. At least a portion of this containment vessel is suitably transparent to at least a portion of the solar radiation spectrum. Containment vessels may comprise plastic glass metal or combinations thereof or a host of other materials. In some cases the containment vessel is a plastic bag or a plastic container. In other cases the containment vessel may comprise a natural and or man made pond lake or body of water which has been covered with a material to prevent mixing of the evolved gases with the atmosphere. The container is suitably impermeable to hydrogen oxygen or both. The container may be made of such an impermeable material. Alternatively the container may be made of a first material and then be coated inside or outside with a quantity of impermeable material so as to confer impermeability on the container.

The container may be rigid or flexible. A system may include a plurality of bladders e.g. formed in rollable plastic that are in fluid communication with a gas collector or gas purifier. In this way a user may have 2 5 10 or more hydrogen producing vessels that feed to a gas purifier or separator that collects the hydrogen. A condenser or other separator may be disposed within or connected to the container. Alternatively the separator may be in fluid communication with the container. For example the container may have an outlet that places gas evolved from water within the container into fluid communication with a condenser or other separator system. As described elsewhere herein the separator system may include a material that preferentially retains e.g. adsorbs or absorbs hydrogen or oxygen. In one embodiment the user may deploy one or more containers across a body of water e.g. ocean lake river . The containers may contain photocatalyst and be operated to evolve H2 and O2 from sea water. The containers may comprise separator systems to separate H2 from O2 or alternatively may be in fluid connection with a separator system that separates gas evolved from two or more containers.

Containers may also be deployed to collect rainwater dew or other condensation. The system may then be operated to evolve H2 or O2 from the gas mixture evolved from the water.

In some embodiments the evolved gas is used to operate a fuel cell so as to produce electricity. The electricity may be used to power a device or alternatively the electricity may be stored for later use. The evolved gases may also be combusted to provide energy in a combustion engine or other device.

As described elsewhere herein a separator system may comprises a membrane that preferentially admits hydrogen or oxygen. The separator may also include an electrochemical device that under application of power is capable of transporting H2 across a membrane or any combination thereof.

The disclosed systems may be configured or operated such that headspace above the water substrate may be flooded with hydrogen so as to reduce the relative concentration of oxygen present. This may reduce the risk of combustion with the hydrogen and oxygen. For example the user may modulate the gas content within a container or compartment such that the ratio of H2 to O2 is below about 5 95 or above about 95 5.

In other embodiments the reactor systems include two compartments or containers. As described elsewhere herein the reactor suitably uses water as a substrate for Hand Oproduction. The systems suitably include a HER photocatalyst absorbs light and catalyzes HER reaction . The systems also suitably include an OER photocatalyst absorbs light and catalyzes OER reaction . The HER and OER photocatalysts suitably evolve H2 and O2 respectively from water when illuminated. The systems also suitably include a gas collection apparatus suitable for collection hydrogen oxygen or both a redox mediator and an ion conductor. In some embodiments the HER photocatalyst is suitably disposed within one compartment and OER photocatalyst is suitably disposed within another compartment which are separated by a porous separator membrane salt bridge or other mechanism to separate the Hand Owhile allowing for the conduction of ions.

The water substrate may be water that is purified or unpurified as described elsewhere herein. The HER and OER photocatalysts suitably absorb light and may comprise a semiconductor a molecule a polymer a composite material a protein or other biomolecule or a biological organism e.g. bacteria or algae . In some embodiments the HER and OER photocatalysts are comprised of semiconductors selected such that the conduction and valence bands are of sufficient energy to catalyze the HER and OER reaction from water respectively. For example the HER photocatalyst has a conduction band energy more negative than E H H 0 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode NHE at the standard state pH 0 25 C. similarly the OER photocatalyst has a valence band energy more positive than E O HO 1.23 V vs. NHE at standard state. Typical HER semiconductor photocatalyst materials include metal oxides e.g. CuO CuO III V semiconductor materials e.g. GaAs GaP AlGaAs InGaAs InGaP GaAsP AlInAs II VI semiconductor materials e.g. CdS CdSe CdTe ZnTe CdZnTe silicon and doped versions thereof. Typical OER photocatalyst materials include metal oxides e.g. TiOand other suboxides of titatium FeOand other iron oxides SrTiO CuO CuO BiVO WO III V semiconductor materials e.g. GaAs GaP AlGaAs InGaAs InGaP GaAsP AlInAs II VI semiconductor materials e.g. CdS CdSe CdTe ZnTe CdZnTe . Alternatively HER and OER semiconductor photocatalysts may comprised materials that are connected in series via an ohmic contact to generate the required voltage to catalyze the HER and OER.

Photocatalysts may be of various shapes and sizes e.g. rods spheres cubes tetrapods or irregular shapes and from 0.1 nm 1 cm or larger in size . In some cases the photocatalysts are dispersed in water. The dispersion may be in the form of a colloidal suspension in which the particles do not settle out over a reasonable period of time e.g. 1 week . In other cases the dispersion may be a suspension of photocatalyst particles that readily settle from solution. In this case the dispersion may or may not be mixed. Mixing may be achieved through convection pumping or stirring of the fluid. In other embodiments the catalyst is present on a surface of a reactor compartment or even on a catalyst support e.g. porous material that is present inside the compartment.

These two compartment systems may also include a gas collection apparatus. The apparatus serves to afford at least hydrogen as obtained from the interaction of light water and the HER and OER photocatalysts of given purity and within a containment vessel at a given pressure. Ranges for purity may be greater than 50 greater than 70 greater than 90 greater than 95 greater than 99 and the like. Ranges for pressure include greater than 0.5 atm of or about 1 atm greater than 1 atm greater than 10 atm greater than 100 atm greater than 1000 atm and the like.

In some cases the gas collection apparatus serves to define at least two compartments. In this case at least one compartment comprises water and the HER photocatalyst termed the hydrogen compartment and at least one other compartment comprises water and the OER photocatalyst termed the oxygen compartment . Various physical and geometrical arrangements of the hydrogen and oxygen compartments are possible. The arrangements of the hydrogen and oxygen compartments may be selected so as to increase the overall efficiency of the photochemical conversion of sunlight and water to hydrogen and oxygen. For example in one embodiment the oxygen compartment may be arranged such that it is between the incident solar irradiation and the hydrogen compartment. In such a configuration termed a tandem configuration OER photocatalysts may be selected such that the oxygen compartment absorbs higher energy photons of the solar spectrum e.g. purple or blue light and HER photocatalysts may be selected such that the hydrogen compartment absorbs lower energy photons of the solar spectrum e.g. orange or red light .

In another embodiment both the hydrogen and oxygen compartment may be irradiated with the same spectrum e.g. the full spectrum of incident solar irradiation. In this particular embodiment the hydrogen and oxygen compartment may be arranged such that they are both between the incident solar spectrum and the earth e.g. next to each other . The systems may have multiple containers i.e. two or more containers for hydrogen evolution two or more containers for oxygen evolution or both. The tandem configuration may include two three or even more containers arranged in a stack so as to reduce the footprint of the device and increase the amount of gas evolved per square foot of device footprint. The containers are suitably transparent or at least configured such that at least a portion of water and catalyst disposed within the containers may be exposed to illumination from exterior to the container.

The systems may also include one or more redox mediators. The redox mediator suitably serves to transport electrons from the OER photocatalyst to the HER photocatalyst and may consist of one or a variety of substance. The redox mediator may be an atom a molecule a protein or other biomolecule a solid state material. A non exhaustive list of redox mediators includes carbon nitrogen sulfur boron a halogen fluoride chloride bromide iodide tin uranium a molecule a dye biomolecules e.g. ferrodoxin azurin plastocyanine cytochrome c NADP NADPH NAD NADH transition metal ions e.g. iron vanadium manganese cobalt chromium copper nickel palladium platinum ruthenium osmium rhodium iridium rhenium and or coordination complexes e.g. ferrocene ferrocinium Fe CN Fe CN Co phen Co phen etc . In some cases the redox mediators are dispersed in solution with the HER and OER photocatalyst. In such embodiments upon illumination of the system electrons are transferred from the OER photocatalyst to a redox mediator or group of redox mediators. In this case the reduced redox mediator or group of mediators is transported from the oxygen compartment to the hydrogen compartment where electrons are then transferred from the mediator or group of mediators to the HER photocatalyst.

Various mechanisms for transport of the mediator or group of mediators between the hydrogen and oxygen compartments may be available. In one case the mediator or group may be transported through a membrane or separator which separates the hydrogen and oxygen compartments. The membrane or separator may be a porous separator an ion exchange membrane or other material as known to those skilled in the art. Various geometries for the membrane or separator are available with respect to the hydrogen and oxygen compartments. In some cases the membrane or separator may comprise a portion or all of the interface between the hydrogen and oxygen compartments. In other cases the membrane or separator may consist of a ultrafiltration UF membrane cartridge . The UF cartridge provides a size selective separation method and may be used to pass water and other ions while preventing mixing of the larger photocatalyst particles. UF cartridges are commercially available e.g. hollow fiber and cross flow cartridges and may be readily known by those skilled in the art. A pump piston or other device may be used to transport or otherwise circulate the redox mediator.

In another embodiment the redox mediator may comprise conductive electrodes which are immersed in the hydrogen and oxygen compartments and which are connected by wires . The redox mediation may be a conductive material such as a metal. In certain embodiments upon illumination electrons are transferred from the OER photocatalyst to the electrode in the oxygen compartment through the wire to the electrode immersed in the hydrogen compartment and to the HER photocatalyst. Various physical and geometric arrangement of the electrodes with respect to the hydrogen and oxygen compartment are possible. For example the electrodes may line a portion or all of the inner walls of the hydrogen and or oxygen compartments or they may be extend from the walls of the compartments into the hydrogen and or oxygen compartments.

An ion conductor serves to transportions between the hydrogen and oxygen compartment e.g. the transport of protons or hydronium from the oxygen compartment to the hydrogen compartment the transport of hydroxide from the hydrogen compartment to the oxygen compartment etc and complete the circuit for photocatalytic water splitting. Put another way an ion conductor places two containers into ionic communication with one another. In one case the ion conductor may be a membrane or separator which separates the hydrogen and oxygen compartments. The membrane or separator may be a porous separator an ion exchange membrane or other material as known to those skilled in the art. Various geometries for the membrane or separator are available with respect to the hydrogen and oxygen compartments. In some cases the membrane or separator may comprise a portion or all of the interface between the hydrogen and oxygen compartments. In other embodiments the membrane or separator represents a portion of the interface between the compartments. The ion conductor may preferentially conduct hydronium protons hydroxide sodium potassium ammonium phosphate borate or any combination thereof.

The present disclosure also provides methods or producing hydrogen oxygen or both. These methods suitably include contacting water to a photocatalytic material adapted to catalytically evolve Hand Ofrom water under illumination. The methods also include illuminating the water and photocatalytic material e.g. with sunlight so as to catalytically evolve a mixture of Hand Ofrom the water. The user may also separate Hfrom the mixture of Hand O separate Ofrom the mixture of Hand O or both.

Hand or Oseparation may be effected by a separator system. Such systems include condensers materials that preferentially retain or admit Hor O. The separator may also as described elsewhere herein include a membrane. The separator may also include an electrochemical device that under application of power is capable of transporting Hacross a membrane. Separation may be effected by pressure swing or temperature swing processes.

Additional production methods are also provided. These methods include in a first chamber contacting water and a first photocatalyst adapted to evolve Hfrom water under illumination in a second chamber contacting water and a second photocatalyst adapted to evolve Ofrom water under illumination illuminating at least a portion of the first chamber e.g. with sunlight so as to effect catalytic production of H and illuminating at least a portion of the second chamber e.g. with sunlight so as to effect catalytic production of O.

The methods further include comprising effecting transport of electrons from the second chamber to the first chamber. The methods also include effecting the transport of ions from the first chamber to the second chamber from the second chamber to the first chamber or both. The user may collect at least a portion of the Hevolved in the first chamber at least a portion of the Oevolved in the second chamber or any combination thereof. Methods of collecting and separating gases are described elsewhere herein in detail. Electron transport may be effected by a conductive material such as a metal. Ion transport may be effected by a material that transports anions cations or both. Porous separators known to those of ordinary skill in the art may bused for this purpose as well as an ion exchange membrane such as Nafion . The user may recover at least a portion of the evolved H at least a portion of the evolved O or both.

Ions conducted during the disclosed processes include protons hydronium hydroxide alkali metal ions e.g. Li Na K alkaline earth metal ions e.g. Mg2 Ca2 Sr2 halide ions e.g. F Cl Br I oxyanions of nitrogen e.g. nitrate nitrite oxyanions of sulfur e.g. sulphate oxyanions of halogens e.g. chlorate chlorite perchlorate bromate perbromate iodate periodate oxyanions of boron e.g. borate oxyanions of phosphorus e.g. phosphate and the like.

In some embodiment the disclosed materials include a light absorbing semiconductor materials present in particulate form. These semiconductor materials may in some embodiments have a bandgap equal to or smaller than about 2.6 eV. Such materials may absorb much of the visible light in the solar spectrum and attractive solar to hydrogen conversion efficiencies are thus obtained.

The particles catalytically convert sunlight and water to H2 and O2 with a solar to hydrogen efficiency of more than about 0.1 over a period of at least about 100 hours.

In some embodiments the energetic position of the conduction and valence band edges of the materials are less than about 0 V vs. NHE normal hydrogen electrode and greater than about 1.23 V vs. NHE at the standard state respectively. As such photogenerated electrons have sufficient potential to participate in hydrogen evolution and photogenerated holes in the valence band have sufficient potential to realize O2 evolution. Hence simultaneous H2 and O2 evolution may be effected. The disclosed materials may perform H2 and O2 evolution without the presence of sacrificial electron donors acceptors.

In some embodiments the disclosed materials may include a Hydrogen Evolution Co catalyst HEC and or an Oxygen Evolution Co catalyst OEC so as to further effect H2 and O2 evolution. Such HEC and or OEC materials are suitably present on an exterior surface of the body.

In some embodiments of the disclosed materials light absorbing materials may be surmounted by a shell. This shell may serve to prevent anodic cathodic decomposition. Bodies formed of the disclosed light absorbing materials may be made sufficiently small e.g. less than 5 nm in cross sectional dimension so as to prevent recombination during carrier transport from the point of generation towards the particle electrolyte interface. By cross sectional dimension is meant thickness diameter or even width as the bodies may be present as e.g. particles flakes platelets sheets and the like.

In one embodiment the disclosed materials may be in a core shell structure core shell nanoparticles are considered especially suitable. In such structures the structure comprises a core that is surmounted by a shell of an insulating material. Bodies having this configuration suitably have at least one cross sectional dimension of less than about 0.5 mm. A platelet or flake configuration may also be used where a central layer which need not be speherical in shape may be encased in a shell material. The shell suitably encases the entirety of the core although total coverage is not a requirement.

Without being bound to any particular theory a core formed from a light absorbing but unstable material may be coated with a shell of an insulating material that protects the core against corrosion. As an example dissolution of a light absorbing particle e.g. Cd dissolution from CdS is reduced or even prevented by encapsulating the unstable particle in a stable insulating shell which shell is suitably transparent to at least a portion of the visible illumination spectrum. The core materials are suitably photoactive being capable of evolving electrons and electron holes in response to illumination.

Some existing catalytic materials entail protection of unstable materials by encapsulation in conductive shells such as a gold or gold SiO2 shell. In such materials charge transport through the shell relies on conduction. The use of conducting shells however may entail at least partial absorption of incident light which in turn results in reduced solar to fuel conversion efficiencies. Also a conductive coating leads to increased recombination as the conductive coating may act as a pathway for shunt currents resulting in increased electron hole recombination and concomitant lower conversion efficiencies. In addition a conductive shell frustrates the creation of materials that have two catalytic sites at different potentials.

Without being bound to any particular theory the disclosed materials operate by way of tunneling transport and the disclosed coatings do not exhibit the above mentioned problems of conductive shells. Coatings having a thickness in the range of from about 0.5 nm to about 10 nm are considered especially suitable.

Any of the forgoing materials may also be doped for use in the disclosed materials. Suitable dopants include Ag Mg Ca Sr Ba Zn Ca CuIn Ga Si Ge Ti Pt V and Nb. Other transition metal cations and combinations of any of the foregoing may be used. These materials can be synthesized by precipitation techniques hydro thermal synthesis solid state reactions gas phase growth techniques e.g. VLS Vapor Liquid Solid growth or a combination of these techniques.

Insulating shell materials include for example oxide materials such as SiO AlO TiO ZrO HfO SnO2 and the like. The shell e.g. oxide layer may be disposed conformally on the light absorbing particles and is suitably stable against anodic cathodic dissolution over a wide range of pH values. Film layers on particles can be deposited with thickness control by using Atomic Layer Deposition ALD in a fluidized bed reactor or rotary reactor configuration. ALD is considered an especially suitable deposition method. A shell is suitably uniform in thickness and is also suitably non porous so as to prevent corrosion. Conformal coatings of insulating layers may also be achieved by means of St ber sol gel and or microemulsion techniques.

The choice of a particular shell material may depend on the medium in which water splitting will be performed. In cases when water splitting may be performed under basic conditions pH of greater than about 12 TiOor HfOare considered especially suitable in alkaline conditions. The alignment of energy levels between the light absorber and the oxide layer may also inform the choice of the material for the oxide shell. As one example the energy level of the conduction band edge of TiOis positioned lower than that of CdS after illumination of TiO coated CdS particles the electron may be transferred to the lower lying TiOCB edge thereby losing some of its potential energy. This charge transfer is not possible when CdS is coated with high bandgap oxides e.g. SiO HfO applying shells of these materials ballistic electron tunneling is expected to take place without energy losses.

The present disclosure also provides iron oxide e.g. hematite FeO or maghemite FeO bodies. These bodies are suitably nanoparticles which need not be spherical in configuration of less than about 50 nm diameter on which both water oxidation Oevolution and proton reduction Hevolution take place. Iron oxide bodies e.g. particles according to the present disclosure are modified by incorporating cation dopants e.g. Mg Zn Si transition metal cations etc. so as without being bound to any particular theory to shift the conduction band edge to a position favorable for proton reduction. The doped p type iron oxide bodies are suitably of dimensions similar to or smaller than the hole diffusion length this size enables the carriers to reach the interface and the presence of suitable dopants enables hydrogen evolution on FeO opening the prospect of efficient oxygen and hydrogen evolution on FeOparticles.

The iron oxide bodies which may be present as particles can be coated with a thin shell consisting of an oxide material which may be different than iron oxide as mentioned elsewhere herein the iron oxide bodies may be doped. Possible dopants include Mg Zn Ca Cu Si Ge Ti Pt V and Nb. Other transition metal cations and combinations of any of the foregoing may be used. Long term catalytic activity of FeObased photocatalysts is enhanced by stable aqueous dispersions in which the particles do not agglomerate once agglomeration occurs the distance photogenerated carriers have to traverse to the particle surface may become too long leading to recombination and concomitant lower catalytic activity. Dispersions of particles in aqueous media can be stabilized electrostatically because protons hydroxyl ions or other ions present in the dispersion e.g. phosphate borate perchlorate sulfate nitrate etc. adsorb to the surface of the particle. Under these conditions the particles are charged and electrostatic repulsion prevents aggregation and subsequent precipitation. The surface charge of particles is the result of acid base equilibria.

When the pH of the medium is close to the Point of Zero Charge PZC the surface charge is zero and the dispersion may be unstable. The PZC is a material property for instance the PZC for hematite ranges from about 5.5 to about 9. Water oxidation on hematite may be performed under basic conditions e.g. pH in the range of from about 9 to about 14 which is relatively close to the PZC of hematite. Under such conditions agglomeration of hematite particles may occur. By contrast the PZC of silica SiO is located at pH 2 4 which is somewhat removed from typical water oxidation conditions pH of greater than about 9 . Hence coating hematite particles with an insulating silica shell reduces or prevents FeOparticle agglomeration in basic water oxidation conditions promoting long term catalytic activity.

Bodies e.g. particles of the disclosed materials may also be decorated with both HEC and OEC materials i.e. the disclosed materials may present HEC and OEC regions. As described above the above mentioned generation of Hand Ousing photocatalytic particles is based on materials having relatively low bandgap about 2.6 eV . For these materials the driving force for electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band to drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution respectively is comparatively small compared to materials with a larger bandgap. A small driving force may result in sluggish kinetics of Hand or Oevolution. Such slow reaction kinetics may be overcome by integrating the light absorbing particles with suitable catalysts for both Hand Oevolution. Without being bound to any one theory effective co catalysts may increase the solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency as a result of one or more of the following 

Suitable OEC materials include metal oxides e.g. RuO2 IrO2 and various cobalt and nickel based oxides amongst others. Suitable HEC materials include Pt Rh Ir Pd Ru RuO2 NiO and Ni amongst others.

The HEC and OEC can be deposited by various methods such as photodeposition and precipitation. One advantage of photodeposition is that catalyst material is deposited on those surface sites where photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate spontaneously. Hence the HEC and OEC materials may be deposited on active sites requiring less catalyst material than in the case where light absorbing particles are conformally coated by HEC OEC material.

Conventional precipitation techniques may also be used to selectively deposit HEC OEC material on oxide coated light absorbing particles. Adding a precursor solution for HEC OEC to a dispersion of oxide coated light absorbing particles may result in selective precipitation of the HEC OEC material onto the already present particles as the surface tension at the solid solid interface is smaller than the surface tension at the solid solution interface favoring heterogeneous precipitation at the particle surface over homogeneous precipitation in the solution. Conventional electrodeposition is also a suitable technique for HEC OEC deposition.

In one embodiment the present disclosure provides a catalytic body comprising a core portion comprising a material having a bandgap in the range of from about 1.23 eV to about 2.6 eV the catalytic body being capable of catalytically converting sunlight and water to Hand Owith a solar to hydrogen efficiency of more than about 0.1 over a period of at least about 100 hours. The solar to hydrogen efficiency n is defined as n R 2 FE P where Ris the rate of hydrogen production per unit of illuminated reactor area the factor 2 corresponds to the amount of electrons required to make one Hmolecule F is the Faraday constant Eis the standard redox potential of 1.23 V for water splitting and Pis the power density of solar irradiation.

The rate of Hproduction for purposes of this disclosure is defined as moles of Hper second per unit area reactor that is illuminated. This measurement thus refers to the moles of Hthat are produced in a given reactor volume defined by the unit surface area multiplied with reactor depth. The power density of solar irradiation is defined as being about 100 mW cmfor AM1.5 irradiation. The upper limit of the catalytic bodies efficiency is at least partially defined by the bandgap of the light absorbing core determining how many photons can be absorbed hence setting the upper value for R.

As described elsewhere herein catalytic bodies according to the present disclosure may also include a shell portion that surmounts at least a portion of the core portion. The shell suitably has a thickness in the range of from about 0.5 nm to about 10 nm or even in the range of from about 1 nm to about 5 nm. The bandgap of the core portion is suitably measured using UV VIS absorption spectroscopy. The thickness of the shell portion may be measured using electron microscopy.

A catalytic body according to the present disclosure suitably has a cross sectional dimension defined elsewhere herein in the range of from about 0.5 nm to about 5 mm or even in the range of from about 10 nm to about 1 mm or even from about 1 nm to about 10 nm.

A catalytic body may be characterized as being configured such that the energetic position of the conduction band edge is less than 0 V relative to NHE at the standard state and wherein the energetic portion of the valence band is greater than about 1.23 V relative to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode NHE at the standard state of about 25 C. and about 1 bar.

The shell may be characterized as being essentially transparent to illumination in the range of from about 380 nm to about 700 nm or from about 400 nm to about 650 nm or even about 500 nm.

Oxides are considered especially suitable materials for use as shells. Suitable oxides include SiO2 Al2O3 TiO2 ZrO2 HfO2. MgO ZnO NiO SnO Ta2O5 VO cobalt oxide and the like. Combinations or mixtures of oxides are also suitable. The shell is suitably chemically stable in photocatalytic water splitting conditions and the shell material is also suitably capable of being applied as a thin film e.g. via atomic layer deposition ALD . Without being bound to any particular theory it is believed that such thin shells allow for electron transport through the shell by tunneling which mechanism differs from the conductive mechanisms seen in existing materials. The shell may be essentially free i.e. having less than about 1 of metal or may even be a pure oxide that is entirely free of metal.

The cores may be formed from a number of materials. A non exhaustive listing of such materials includes chalcogenides oxy nitrides oxy sulfides a Group III V semiconductor e.g. InP or GaAs crystalline silicon amorphous silicon crystalline germanium amorphous germanium any alloy thereof or any combination thereof. Photoactive materials e.g. CdS CdSe may be purchased commercially. Alternatively core particles may be synthesized by techniques known in the art such as co precipitation sol gel methods solid state synthesis and gas phase growth techniques e.g. chemical vapor deposition or vapor liquid solid growth amongst others. Suitable chalcogenides include MoS2 WS2 MoSe2 FeS2 CdS CdSe CdTe PbS and combinations thereof. CdS CdSe and MoSeare considered especially suitable. TaON GaN Ge3N4 Ta3N5 or combinations thereof are all considered suitable oxynitrides TaON and TaNare especially suitable. Iron oxides including maghemite hematite and other iron oxide forms are also suitable.

Suitable oxy sulfide materials include SmTiOS La based oxysulfides FeS NiS AgS CoS or any combination thereof. Suitable group III V semiconductors which may be present in particle form include InP GaAs GaInP InAs and the like as well as combinations thereof. InP is especially suitable. As is described elsewhere herein the disclosed bodies may also include hydrogen evolving HEC and oxygen evolving co catalyst OEC materials. The HEC and OEC materials may contact the core of the body or even contact the shell of the body if such a shell is present.

Alternative catalytic bodies in addition to those described previously are also provided herein. Such bodies suitably include a core comprising iron oxide e.g. FeO FeO or both the core further comprising a cationic dopant and the core defining a cross sectional dimension in the range of from about 0.5 nm to about 50 Mg Zn Ca Cu Si Ge nm. A variety of cationic dopants may be used e.g. Ti Pt V Nb. Other transition metal cations and combinations of any of the foregoing may be used. The cationic dopant may be present at from about 0.01 to about 10 atomic concentrations or from about 2 to about 8 atomic concentration. Atomic concentrations of from about 0.1 to about 5 atomic concentration are considered especially suitable.

The energetic position of the conduction band edge is suitably less than 0 V relative to NHE at the standard state and wherein the energetic portion of the valence band is greater than 1.23 V relative to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode NHE at the standard state of 25 C. and 1 bar.

In some embodiments a shell portion encloses the core. As described elsewhere herein oxides are considered suitable shell materials the materials is suitably chemically stable in photocatalytic water splitting conditions over a wide pH range and may be applied as a very thin film. In some embodiments a stable colloidal dispersions may be achieved when the value of the point of zero charge of the shell material differs by about 5 pH units from the pH value in which water splitting is performed. The difference need not be about 5 pH units as the difference may be less than 5 units e.g. 1 2 3 or about 4 units or even greater than 5 units e.g. 6 7 8 or even 9 units . The shell is suitably essentially transparent to visible light as described above.

Illustrative non limiting presents a schematic of an iron oxide particle according to the present disclosure and suitable for use in photocatalytic water splitting. Iron oxide is earth abundant inexpensive and absorbs visible light but the material also presents comparatively poor carrier mobility causing photogenerated carriers to recombine before they reach the iron oxide electrolyte interface and also that the potential of electrons in the iron oxide conduction band is too low to participate in hydrogen evolution. These disadvantages may be overcome by applying small about 5 nm in diameter p type iron oxide particles. By reducing the size of the particles to a diameter of about 5 nm carriers can reach the surface before recombining. By doping the iron oxide with cations like Mg or Zn the conduction band edge shifts upwards enabling photogenerated electrons to participate in hydrogen evolution.

Any of the foregoing catalytic bodies may also comprise a first co catalyst. This first co catalyst may be present on exterior surface of the body. It should be understood that this exterior surface of the body may be an exterior surface of the core or depending on the embodiment may be an exterior surface of an optional shell if such a shell e.g. an oxide shell is present. The first co catalyst may be an oxygen evolving catalyst or a hydrogen evolving catalyst. Suitable oxygen evolving catalysts include RuO IrO gold palladium platinum silver nickel NiO NiFeO nickel oxyhydroxide Ni borate OEC Co borate OEC Co phosphate OEC CoO CoOx rhodium RhxCrO or any combination thereof. It should be understood that in some embodiments the light absorbing material or body performs the function of H2 evolution from water. In some embodiments one co catalyst performs O2 evolution and another co catalyst effects both light absorption and is also a catalyst for H2 evolution. In some embodiments the core material acts to produce electrons and electron holes under illumination and a HEC co catalyst evolves H2 and a OEC co catalyst evolves O2. In other embodiments the core material acts to produce electrons and electron holes under illumination as well as to evolve H2 and a OEC co catalyst evolves O2. In still other embodiments the core material acts to produce electrons and electron holes under illumination and evolves O2 and a HEC co catalyst evolves H2. It should be understood that the core material may thus be a source of electrons and electron holes a source of electrons and electron holes and H2 evolution a source of electrons and electron holes and O2 evolution or even a source of electrons and electron holes and H2 and O2 evolution. A core material that is capable of itself evolving H2 may be supplemented with one or more HEC co catalysts and optionally one or more OEC catalysts. Similarly a core material that is capable of itself evolving O2 may be supplemented with one or more OEC co catalysts and optionally one or more HEC catalysts.

Suitable hydrogen evolving catalysts include platinum ruthenium gold palladium silver RuO Ni and alloys thereof e.g. NiFe NiMo NiMoCd NiMoZn and the like NiO CoOx or any combination thereof. In some embodiments the first co catalyst may be an oxygen evolving catalyst and wherein the body further comprises a hydrogen evolving catalyst. Alternatively the first co catalyst may be a hydrogen evolving catalyst and the body further comprises an oxygen evolving catalyst. Without being bound to any particular configuration a catalytic body may contain from about 1 to 2 weight percent HEC and or OEC. Catalyst loading may however be in the range of from about 0.01 to about 10 or even about 15 weight percent depending on the user s needs and on other operational parameters. For example iron oxide particles may be comparatively small e.g about 5 nm in diameter which small size in turn requires that only a modest amount of electrons holes need to be converted. By contrast a CdS particle may be comparatively large e.g 1 mm in diameter which particles will in turn absorb more light. Because the surface area of a comparatively larger particle relative to the volume is small more catalyst may be required to process all photogenerated electrons holes.

Illustrative non limiting presents a schematic of an exemplary TaNparticle decorated with both HEC and OEC material. Existing photocatalytic particles e.g. TaN can facilitate only one of the half reactions of overall water splitting efficiently i.e. water oxidation or proton reduction . By decorating such particles by both HEC and OEC material charge separation is more efficient reducing recombination reaction rates are enhanced and the desired half reactions outcompete undesired half reactions such as particle dissolution. Accordingly the disclosed materials present a higher activity for simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen evolution.

The present disclosure also provides methods of evolving hydrogen and oxygen from water. These methods suitably include contacting a catalytic body as described in the present disclosure to a fluid comprising water and illuminating the catalytic body and water so as to evolve H2 O2 or both. The fluid may be ocean water river water rain water or virtually any other aqueous fluid. The fluid may be pure or may contain pollutants metals salts and the like. It should be understood that these methods encompass the use of multiple particles according to the present disclosure and that a user may contact water with particles that differ from one another in one or more aspects e.g. size material composition .

The user may separate the evolved H2 O2 or both. This separation may be effected for example by a condenser or by pressure or temperature swing adsorption. Exemplary methods of effecting separation are set forth in U.S. patent application 61 566 078 filed Dec. 2 2011 Systems And Methods For Photocatalytic Production Of Hydrogen From Water the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure also provides methods of evolving H2 and O2 from water. These methods include contacting an iron oxide catalytic body as described elsewhere herein to a fluid comprising water and illuminating the catalytic body and water so as to evolve H2 O2 or both. The evolution of H2 and O2 is performed at a solar to hydrogen efficiency of greater than about 0.1 over a period of at least about 100 hours. The user may separate evolved H2 evolved O2 or both suitable separation methods are set forth in U.S. patent application No. 61 566 078.

Also provided are methods of forming a catalytic body. These methods include forming a catalytic body comprising one or more core particles of iron oxide e.g. FeO FeO or both and the body further comprising a cationic dopant the one or more particles defining a cross sectional dimension in the range of from about 0.5 nm to about 50 nm. Cationic dopant may be introduced during the nucleation of the one or more particles during the growth of the one or more particles or both. One may introduce the cationic dopant to a particle precursor material. For instance one method for synthesizing FeOor FeOparticles is to add a solution containing Fe and Fe ions to an alkaline medium so as to co precipitate FeOparticles which are oxidized into FeOor FeOin a subsequent step . Doping of the initial FeOparticles can be achieved by adding a certain amount of dopant ions to the Fe Fe precursor solution. The dopant may be present in the range of from about 0.1 to about 5 atomic percent. A user may also introduce a cationic dopant by annealing the one or more particles in the presence of the dopant. Doping may for instance be achieved by mixing undoped iron oxide powder with the dopant and by subsequent annealing in an oven containing a gaseous atmosphere. Alternatively an aqueous dispersion to which the dopant is added can be annealed under hydrothermal conditions e.g. in an autoclave in which temperatures 100 C. can be obtained for aqueous dispersions .

The present disclosure also provides methods. These methods include suspending under illumination a catalyst body within a solution that comprises a precursor material for an Oevolving catalyst Hevolving catalyst the illumination giving rise to photogenerated electrons or holes on the surface of the catalytic body the photogenerated electrons or holes reducing or oxidizing the precursor material for the Oevolving catalyst Hevolving catalyst or both so as to result in deposition of Oevolving catalyst Hevolving catalyst or both on the photo excited particle.

For the photodeposition process the catalyst precursor materials e.g. hexachloroplatinic acid for Pt deposition or Ni NO for Ni NiO deposition are suitably dissolved in an aqueous dispersion containing the photocatalytic bodies. The dispersion may be illuminated by a white light source e.g. a Xe lamp. An advantage of applying both HEC and OEC materials is that charge separation of photogenerated electrons and holes may be more efficient in that holes accumulate on OEC and electrons on HEC.

The catalyst body may be a catalyst body according to the present disclosure i.e. one that includes a core portion comprising a material having a bandgap in the range of from about 1.23 eV to about 2.6 eV the catalytic body being capable of catalytically converting sunlight and water to H2 and O2 with a solar to hydrogen efficiency of more than about 0.1 over a period of at least about 100 hours. The catalyst body may include a shell as described elsewhere herein or may lack such a shell.

The present disclosure also provides systems. These systems suitably include a container configured to contact a catalyst body with water the container being adapted to permit illumination of the catalyst and water with a source of illumination. The catalyst body is suitably a catalyst body according to the present disclosure. The body may as described elsewhere herein include a shell but the inclusion of such a shell is not a requirement. The catalyst body may be disposed on the surface of a support such as a porous material. The system may also include a device capable of separating H2 from O2 the device being in fluid communication with the container. Such devices include condensers materials that preferentially adsorb hydrogen over oxygen or oxygen over hydrogen and the like. The systems may include a fluidic connection between the container and the device capable of separating H2 from O2. The system may further include a fluidic connection between the device capable of separating H2 from O2 and one or more containers adapted to contain H2 O2 or both.

The container of the system is suitably adapted to permit illumination of the catalyst and water with sunlight. A container may also include a region that is essentially transparent to sunlight. Systems may also include a source of illumination configured to illuminate catalyst and water disposed within the container. Such illumination sources may be white light sources monochromatic light sources and the like. Xenon lamps light emitting diodes and the like are suitable illumination sources.

The following examples are intended to illustrate certain embodiments of the present invention but are not to be construed as limiting and do not exemplify the full scope of the invention.

The following prophetic example describes photocatalytic production of hydrogen and oxygen gases from water using a colloidal suspension of p n doped nanowires or nanorods. The nanowires are comprised of at least one semiconductor material such that a p n junction is formed within the nanowires or nanorods. Upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation excited electrons travel to one end of the nanowires or nanorod and the corresponding electron hole travels to the other end.

In this example an iron oxide employed as the semiconductor. Iron oxide semiconductor material is generally stable to corrosion under the conditions for water splitting. In addition the band positions and band gap of a p n junction of an iron oxide is appropriate for 1 efficient absorption of visible light and 2 the production of hydrogen and oxygen gas from water e.g. see Leygraf et al. J. Catalysis 1982 78 341 351 Turner et al. J. Electrochem Soc. 1984 131 1777 1783 . The p type and n type iron oxide may be formed by doping iron oxide with Mg and Si respectively as described previously. Iron oxide nanowires or nanorods can be prepared as described previously e.g. see Crowley et al. Chem. Rev. 2003 15 3518 3522 but using further incorporation of the selected components to be doped. Upon formation of the nanowires or nanorods the nanowires or nanorods may be exposed to a solution comprising selected metal ionic species and anionic species and exposed to electromagnetic radiation e.g. sunlight . Excited electrons can travel to the p type end of the wire where they can reduce protons to hydrogen. The electron holes can travel to the n type end of the wire where they can oxidize water to oxygen.

In some embodiments a hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution catalysts may be formed substantially simultaneously at the surface of the p n nanowires or nanorod respectively. For example the nanowires or nanorods may be dissolved in a solution containing Ni ions and borate buffer electrolyte. In this way and in the presence of light a nickel oxide borate catalyst can form on the n type side of the nanowires or nanorod which can serve as a catalyst for the oxidation of water to oxygen. Similarly the Ni ions can be reduced to Ni metal at the p type end of the nanowires or nanorod where the Ni metal can then serve as a catalyst for the reduction of protons to hydrogen.

In this way a colloidal suspension of p n nanowires or nanorods loaded with catalysts for the production of hydrogen and oxygen are readily formed. The nanoreactors are comprised of low cost earth abundant materials and may operate in buffered borate electrolyte at near neutral pH pH 9.2 . The suspension may be prepared in low cost containers i.e. plastic bags to hold the water and collect the resulting hydrogen and oxygen gases which may be separated outside of the reactor.

The following prophetic example describes photocatalytic production of hydrogen and oxygen gases from water using a colloidal suspension of dye sensitized nanoparticles. Most of the photocatalyst materials explored to date are comprised of metal oxide semiconductors having bandgaps of 3 eV or larger. These materials have proven to be excellent photocatalysts for water oxidation however their poor absorption of visible light limits the overall efficiency for solar energy conversion. Photoactive dye molecules may be chemically adsorbed to the surface of wide bandgap metal oxide particles that have been loaded with catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction HER . In this scheme excitation of the dye molecule promotes the transfer of an electron from the dye to the particle. The electron resides in the semiconductor conduction band allowing transport of the electron to the hydrogen evolution catalyst. The corresponding electron hole remains on the dye where it is later consumed by an associated catalytic material. Dye sensitization of TiOwith polypyridyl complexes of Rhas been used for the photoproduction of Hfrom protons with methanol Kajiwara T. Hasimoto K. Kawai T. Sakata T. 1982 86 4516 and later I Abe R. Sayama K. Arakawa H. 2003 379 230 serving as the electron source. To affect water splitting the semiconductor and dye molecule should be interfaced with appropriate and selective catalysts for HER and the oxygen evolution reaction OER respectively.
