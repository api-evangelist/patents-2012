The present invention relates generally to electronic commerce transactions. More particularly the present invention relates to electronic commerce transactions with a marketing company. The invention also relates to using electronic networks to manage independent businesses associated with the marketing company.

The Internet is becoming the world s new market place. The number of people and businesses that have access to the Internet is growing rapidly. Businesses are increasingly interested in selling and marketing products and services over the Internet particularly via the World Wide Web WWW .

In particular marketing companies including multilevel marketing companies are increasingly becoming familiar with the power of the Internet and its reach to potential new customers and members. Heretofore however the full capabilities of the Internet to provide a complete opportunity for electronic commerce with a marketing system in combination with a membership buying club have not been achieved.

For example conventional systems and methods for carrying out electronic transactions such as shopping have generally required separate electronic shopping baskets when shopping from various merchants that may be associated with a particular web site. In addition conventional systems have generally not been capable of providing a distribution system that allows distribution of the products of several sellers. Indeed such distribution systems have not allowed products to be distributed through a single independent sales network but with different levels and structures of compensation for different product lines.

Conventional multilevel marketing systems in particular have generally not been able to provide a system for allowing members within the system to purchase directly from a marketing company associated with the marketing system. Moreover these conventional systems have generally not provided bonuses and or commissions based upon sales made directly to the members by the marketing company as well as sales made to the members from a member s sponsor. Indeed conventional multilevel marketing companies have relied upon the shear number of the distributors or members associated with the marketing company to promote and market its products and services as well as add members to the marketing system. Moreover those companies doing business over the Internet have generally required that a shopper purchase products via a web page that is sponsored by one of the members of the marketing company.

Thus there is a need to overcome the disadvantages described above. There is a particular need to provide a system and method for a single marketing distribution system that can distribute the products of several different sellers all distributed through a single independent sales network but with different levels and structures of compensation for different product lines. There is a further need to allow shoppers to shop for and buy products from different sources in a single transaction. There is a particular need to provide a system and method that allows a shopper to purchase products directly from a marketing company a registered business owner and a merchant partner and to do so using an electronic shopping basket that is preferably persistent throughout the web site.

The present invention solves the problems with and overcomes the disadvantages of conventional marketing systems.

Personal consumption by an IBO preferably does not count toward this qualification. It should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art however that the personal consumption by an IBO could count toward the qualification but it is preferred that it does not. Each IBO thus qualified is entitled to earn a performance bonus based on the IBO s own purchases the purchases of his or her personal group sales made to by the IBO sales made to by the personal group. These sales may include sales made to individuals outside the marketing system such as neighbors. Each IBO is entitled but not required to sponsor other IBOs and to introduce new Members.

In an alternative embodiment the participation categories of the present invention can comprise IBOs Members and Clients. It should be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art that the present invention is not limited to a particular selection of participation categories and other categories with varying benefits privileges and characteristics could be used within the scope of the invention.

Referring now to there is shown an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. According to the present invention it is preferred that a company s products and or services are marketed and sold to customers who may include but is not limited to Clients Members Members Plus and IBOs using an independent network of distributors in conjunction with direct retailing to the customer. As will be described in more detail below each distributor within the distribution force may be compensated in a variety of ways including but not limited to multilevel compensation which includes compensation on sales made directly by the distributor as well as sales made by others commissions or retail markup on sales made only directly by the distributor or other suitable types of commissions or compensation. Each distributor is preferably an Independent Business Owner IBO whose individual success depends upon that IBO s retailing efforts as well as the retailing efforts of those sponsored by the IBO in accordance with the present invention.

As shown in the present invention preferably comprises four different participation levels or categories within the marketing company s distribution system of the preferred embodiment e.g. Client Member Members Plus and IBO . The solid arrows in represent the exemplary methods by which products and or services may be sold in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The broken lines in represent the relationship between the various levels within a particular IBO s personally sponsored group. Each of these exemplary methods and relationships will be described in more detail below.

As noted above a Client is preferably a retail customer who may purchase products and or services directly from the marketing company. Alternatively Client may purchase products and or services from an IBO or Member Plus at a price established by the IBO or Member Plus . The price established is preferably higher than the price paid by the IBO the IBO price however the price charged to Client is preferably at the discretion of IBO or Member Plus . Client preferably purchases products at retail prices wherein the retail price which is set by IBO or Member Plus is preferably higher than the IBO price. Client may also have exposure only to a subset of the total core product and catalog lines. Clients may be personally referred by IBO or Member Plus . Unsolicited referrals will be preferably be offered Client status and assigned to the appropriate IBO as will be described below. Clients may be serviced either directly by IBO or Members Plus or alternatively may be serviced by marketing company on behalf of IBO or Member Plus or a merchant partner.

A Member by paying an annual fee is preferably entitled to purchase products and or services for their own consumption directly from the marketing company at a price equal to or greater than the price paid by Independent Business Owners IBO s . Alternatively Member may purchase products and or services from an IBO or Member Plus . In a preferred embodiment the price paid by Member is less than the price paid by Client . The marketing company may also offer direct marketing promotions targeted at Members . Member however is preferably not entitled to a performance bonus or commission nor is Member authorized to recruit or sponsor other Members . Moreover Members are not encouraged or authorized to resell products from the marketing company . Members however who refer other Members will preferably receive referral incentives.

A Member Plus is an individual who indicates an intention of becoming an IBO but has not generated the requisite sales volume to end user consumers in order to qualify. Member Plus is interested in purchasing products from the marketing company at IBO prices as well as in becoming an IBO . Member Plus may also be entitled to purchase products and services for their own consumption directly from the marketing company at the same prices as Members . Various products and services which are available to IBO s but not to Members may also be available to Members Plus . Members Plus are preferably not entitled to a performance bonus or commission. In order to earn a bonus or commission Member Plus must first qualify as an IBO . Member Plus transitions to IBO by qualifying to earn bonus income. Members Plus are encouraged and authorized to resell the company s products as well as to generate new sales to direct buying consumers such as Members and Clients . Moreover Members Plus are authorized to recruit or sponsor other Members into the organization.

In one embodiment of the present invention upon notification of their intent to become an IBO a Member transitions to a Member Plus by paying a fee and purchasing a Business Kit which gives them the right to recruit and retail. The fee entitles Member Plus to purchase products at IBO prices. If Member Plus fails to qualify as an IBO within a stated period of time for example but not limited to two years Member Plus shall preferably automatically revert to Member status.

An Independent Business Owner IBO is an individual interested in earning income which includes but is not limited to performance bonuses and commissions from the sale of products from the marketing company. In addition IBO is also entitled to purchase products for his her own consumption. IBO may also be described as a Member Plus who has received a Performance Bonus and therefore has qualified to become an IBO . BO has the ability to recruit retail and receive a bonus. IBO can purchase all products from the core product and catalog lines at the IBO pricing level. IBO can place standing and recurring orders for products in both unit and lot quantities. Moreover IBO is entitled and encouraged to resell products to end user consumers as well as to generate direct sales by marketing company to such end user consumers including Members Members Plus and Clients and even to individuals who are not registered with the marketing company such as neighbors of IBO . Each IBO is entitled to charge any markup he or she chooses for products he or she resells at retail prices.

It is preferred that IBO can earn bonus credit not only for sales to Members Members Plus and or Clients through IBO s distribution network but also for sales made directly by marketing company to a customer that do not involve a resale by IBO . For example IBO may be authorized to earn bonuses from the direct sale of a particular product from marketing company to the end user. Under such a system IBO earns a bonus payment from marketing company based on the customer s purchases.

In order to qualify for bonuses from the direct sale of a product from the marketing company to a customer who is not in the IBO s direct line of sponsorship an assignment of the customer to a particular IBO must be established. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the customer is assigned to a particular IBO based on one or more criteria preferably to choose from a select group of IBO s . Such criteria can include but is not limited to the following 1 The IBO is a Direct Fulfillment or Founders Direct IBO. A Direct Fulfillment IBO is one who preferably utilizes the company s direct shipment method by which products are drop shipped directly to each Client Member Member Plus or IBO rather than being delivered exclusively through a Platinum IBO an IBO who succeeds in sponsoring a personal group that generates a prescribed volume of business for example 15 000 per month in 6 months of any fiscal year which will be described in more detail below . A Founders Direct IBO is an IBO that has achieved a particularly consistent high level of business activity as an IBO 2 The IBO is active or maintains a specified level of activity or 3 The IBO is in the geographic proximity to the Client based on postal or zip code.

In the preferred embodiment the Client may then be given the IBO s contact information with an option to indicate if the Client wishes the IBO to contact them. Otherwise the entire assignment process is preferably transparent from the Client s perspective and the particular IBO only sees the volume associated with the direct sales to the Client.

In order to transition from Member Plus to IBO as noted above each Member Plus must qualify as an IBO by earning a bonus income. To qualify to earn bonus income each IBO must preferably generate at least 50 PV of sales in a month to end user consumers. Preferably all products and services sold to end users are assigned two sets of numbers Point Value PV which is used to determine the Performance Bonus bracket and Business Volume BV which is a dollar figure established for each product which is totaled monthly to represent monthly sales. Alternately IBO can qualify by generating a specified level of sales to 10 different customers including Members and or Clients . Personal consumption by IBO preferably does not count towards this qualification. Each IBO thus qualified is entitled to earn a performance bonus based on the IBO s own purchases and the purchases of his or her personal group plus the purchases of Members introduced into the business by the IBO . Each IBO is entitled but not required to sponsor other IBO s and to introduce new Members . This is the preferred method by which IBO may grow his personal group and thus his personal business. An exemplary personal group is shown in .

As can be seen in an IBO s personal group can comprise numerous subgroups which are linked to the original IBO through various forms of sponsorship. One exemplary subgroup consists of the original IBO a second sponsored IBO Member Plus Member and Client . In an alternate subgroup original IBO sponsors Member Plus who sponsors both Member and second IBO . Likewise Member refers Client . Thus it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that an IBO s personal group may contain numerous subgroups each of which can vary in the number and relationships between the different participation levels.

Moreover a Line of Sponsorhip or LOS refers to an IBO s direct heritage or ancestry in the marketing company business. In other words the LOS refers to an IBO s sponsor the IBO s sponsor s sponsor and so on. An exemplary LOS is shown in with reference for example to IBO IBO and IBO . It can be said that the line of sponsorship is the linkage between all IBOs in a specific organization similar to a family tree. In addition IBO may refer to IBO and IBO as IBO s downline. It should be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art that such a reference would be to those IBOs sponsored by IBO . Likewise IBO may refer to IBO and IBO as IBO s upline which would denote those IBOs who have sponsored IBO into the marketing system.

In another embodiment of the present invention when IBO sponsors a new IBO and begins to help IBO create a group that IBO s personal group may be generally referred to as for example a leg in IBO s business organization. An exemplary leg is shown in e.g. IBO IBO Member Plus and Member .

In one embodiment each of the different levels or membership types Client Member Member Plus and IBO does not have complete access to all products and product lines. In another embodiment only IBO s have complete access to all products and product lines. It is preferred that the particular level determines the degree of access to products and product lines. In one embodiment the degree of access increases as the level transitions from Client to Member to Member Plus to IBO and as the personal group of an IBO grows. In an alternative embodiment a different product mix or group may be offered to persons based on their particular participation level through the use of for example but not limited to product promotions. In an alternative embodiment a product mix may be customized to tailor to different customers or groups of customers.

In a further embodiment of the invention if a product or model number or identification number for a particular product is provided by the customer then that customer can purchase that particular product regardless of the customer s membership level. It should be understood that products may be presented to each of the levels through a variety of medium including but not limited to written oral electronic etc. such as through catalogs product displays cassette and video tapes multi media devices and the Internet. However it should be apparent to one having skill in the art that the present invention is not limited to any particular presentation method.

Referring now to there are shown six exemplary methods by which a new customer can become associated or registered with the marketing system of the present invention. As shown in one embodiment of the present invention allows the customer to sign up as a Member Member Plus to immediately begin the qualification process to becoming an IBO. In such an embodiment the customer bypasses the Client level to register as a Member. Thus the registered customer immediately enjoys the privileges and benefits of the Member Plus as described herein.

As shown in a second embodiment of the registration process is shown. In this embodiment the customer may register as a Member and enjoy the accompanying benefits and shopping privileges. The Member may subsequently at a point later in time choose to register as a Member Plus at which point the Member will begin the qualification process of becoming an IBO.

A third embodiment of the invention is shown in . In this embodiment a customer initially registers as a Client or retail customer serviced by an IBO. Subsequently the Client may be prompted by another Member or the IBO to reconsider the benefits of Membership. If the Client chooses the Client will then register as a Member Member Plus to begin the qualification process of becoming an IBO. The Client can also subsequently at an independent stage register as a Member Member Plus to begin the qualification process of being an IBO.

A fourth embodiment of the registration process is shown in . This embodiment represents the longest route to becoming an IBO. In such an embodiment the customer initially registers as a Client and then subsequently at independent stages registers as a Member Member Plus and IBO respectively. It is preferred that as shown in through one must register as a Member prior to or simultaneously with registering to qualify as a Member Plus IBO.

A fifth embodiment of the registration process is shown in . This embodiment allows the customer to sign up as a Member to immediately begin the qualification process to becoming an IBO. In such an embodiment the customer bypasses the Client level to register as a Member. Thus the registered customer immediately enjoys the privileges and benefits of the Member as described herein.

A sixth embodiment of the registration process is shown in . In this embodiment a customer initially registers as a Client or retail customer serviced by an IBO. Subsequently the Client may be prompted by another Member or the IBO to reconsider the benefits of Membership. If the Client chooses the Client will then register as a Member. The Client can also subsequently at an independent stage register as a Member to begin the qualification process of becoming an IBO.

In the embodiments shown in and a Member is entitled to qualify as an IBO and there is no separate transition Member Plus participation category.

Generally it is preferred that each Member is initially sponsored into the marketing system by another IBO who can function as that Member s supplier and or contact with the marketing company. Alternatively the Member may purchase products directly from the marketing company at the specified Member price. The Members and Members Plus sponsored by an IBO are referred to as the IBO s personally sponsored group or personal group. IBO s who both generate personal sales to Clients and or Members and sponsor a personal group that generates a large volume of product purchases may receive a substantial income including for example performance bonuses and commissions from the sales. In one embodiment of the present invention the IBO s group volume is used to calculate the IBO s performance bonus. This group volume includes the IBO s personal volume personal group volume and all down line non direct those IBOs not sponsored directly into the marketing company by the particular IBO in question or in other words IBOs sponsored by individuals within the IBO s personal group IBOs volume. An IBO s personal group volume preferably includes but is not limited to the IBO s personal volume as well as the volume generated by IBO s below the 25 bonus level in the IBO s down line group. Personal volume can include but is not limited to volume from an IBO s own personal orders PV BV transfers and miscellaneous account adjustments. PV BV transfers can include but are not limited to methods of adjusting PV BV from one IBO to another. Transfer of such volumes assures bonus checks are paid correctly.

Under the marketing system of the present invention IBO s earn income by generating sales of products and or services. These sales may be made directly to end users by the IBO or the marketing company or may be made by Members Plus or other IBO s within the IBO s personal group. In addition IBO s can profit from retail price increases or mark up on sales. It is preferred that IBO s are able to set their own retail prices. Moreover an IBO can earn a monthly performance bonus based on the combined total volume of products and services moved by the IBO and his or her personal group. Alternatively the IBO can also earn performance bonuses based upon direct sales made by the marketing company to customers who are linked to a particular IBO which will be described in more detail below. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the higher the sales volume for a particular month the higher the percentage rate of bonus. An exemplary percentage rate of bonus is in the range of about 1 to about 25 preferably between about 3 and about 25 although other bonus ranges may be used. An IBO s sales volume will vary depending in part upon the sales volume of others in his personal group and the volume of direct sales from the marketing company to end users. If an IBO succeeds in sponsoring new IBO s who then generate large volumes of product sales then the original IBO can earn additional bonus income.

If and when an IBO succeeds in sponsoring a personal group that generates a prescribed volume of business for example 15 000 per month in 6 months of any fiscal year that IBO may become a Platinum IBO. At this point the Platinum IBO s sponsor no longer receives any Performance Bonus from the Platinum IBO s sales volume but may be eligible for other bonuses as described in further detail below. An IBO who sponsors IBO s can become eligible for higher bonuses and or commissions.

An exemplary bonus and commission structure is described herein below. It should be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art that numerous bonus and or commission structures may be employed within the present invention and the following exemplary embodiments should not be construed as limiting the present invention to a particular structure.

An IBO s gross income can be based on immediate income or a discount from retail product sales and a Performance Bonus. As used herein gross income preferably means the amount received from retail sales of products and or services either directly by the IBO the marketing company or the IBO s personal group minus the cost of goods sold plus the amount of Performance Bonus retained. Gross income preferably does not include deductions for business expenses which will vary according to the manner in which each individual IBO operates his or her own business.

Preferably all products and services sold to end users are assigned two sets of numbers Point Value PV which is used to determine the Performance Bonus bracket and Business Volume BV which is a dollar figure established for each product which is totaled monthly to represent monthly sales.

In a preferred embodiment every product is assigned a PV number including marketing company and merchant partner products. In an alternate embodiment only marketing company products are assigned a PV number. An IBO s monthly PV total preferably determines the percentage used for Performance Bonus payments in accordance with a Performance Bonus Schedule.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention every product has an established BV number a dollar figure which is multiplied by a percentage for example between 3 and 25 to determine an IBO s monthly Performance Bonus. This percentage is determined by an IBO s PV total. All bonus payments are preferably based on a combination of PV and BV.

As noted above the amount of Performance Bonus is preferably determined by a combination of PV and BV. In one embodiment the PV BV ratio is maintained in relation to the Consumer Price Index. Computing Performance Bonus on PV emphasizes units sold not price. As inflation causes prices to increase a larger bonus is earned from the same units sold.

In a preferred embodiment each product sold is assigned a PV and BV. In one embodiment PV is equal to approximately one half of the IBO cost and BV is equal to approximately 1.15 times the IBO cost. The PV and BV values may vary from product to product. PV and BV can be earned in a variety of different ways including but not limited to the following an IBO s personal purchases the purchases of Clients Members and other IBO s in the IBO s personal group including the purchases of Members introduced by the IBO and the purchases of customers directly from the company.

The following Table 1 shows an exemplary Performance Bonus Schedule for use in the present invention.

Under the schedule shown in Table 1 the total Point Value of all merchandise purchased during a particular month determines the Performance Bonus percentage for that month. The greater the total monthly Point Value the greater the Performance Bonus Percentage. In addition an annual volume can be calculated based on an IBO s personal volume plus pass up from non qualified less than 25 legs. The volume for non qualified Members Plus is preferably not included. Pass up as used herein generally refers to for example the PV BV created by non qualified IBO volume that continues to be passed up until combined volume reaches the 25 Performance Bonus level as noted above.

Having now generally described the bonus and commission structure of the present invention the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.

A particular IBO s sponsor group is made up of five Clients and five Members. As a portion of his or her income the IBO receives the retail mark up from purchases made by the Clients. Retail mark up is the difference between the price normally paid for a particular product and the price actually charged to the customer. According to the present invention IBO s are not obligated to charge a particular retail price therefore each IBO is entitled to independently determine the prices at which products will be sold to other IBO s Clients Members Members Plus or other customers. In addition the IBO can receive a Performance Bonus which is calculated based upon the volume of sales made to the five Members within the IBO s personal group. The larger the sales volume the larger the percentage of Performance Bonus the IBO can receive.

If each of the five Clients and five Members in the IBO s group purchase 50.00 worth of products in a given month the total sales volume for the month is 500.00 50.00 10 . If suggested retail for the products is 35.00 then the total retail mark up for the month is 75.00 assuming the five Clients pay a marked up price of 50.00 i.e. total retail mark up 5 Clients 15.00 retail mark up 75.00 . The individual BV values assigned to the products purchased by the Members is 40.25BV 1.15 35 40.25 . The individual BV values assigned to the products purchased by the Clients is 57.50BV 1.15 50 57.50 . Thus total BV values for all purchases is 488.75BV 5 Clients times the 57.50BV value added to 5 Members times the 40.25BV . Using Table 1 above the Performance Bonus based upon the total sales volume for the month would be 14.66 3 of 488.75BV . Accordingly the IBO s monthly total income would be 89.66 75.00 plus 14.66 . If such a performance level is maintained for 12 consecutive months the IBO s total annual gross income would be 1 076.00.

The IBO of Example 1 may increase his or her income by growing the business through sponsorship of any number of others into the business. For example if the IBO locates three individuals who become IBO s and they in turn develop customers each would contribute to the overall volume on which the original IBO s Performance Bonus is based.

In summary assume the IBO s personally sponsored group volume generates 1 500.00 per month in total sales 3 groups of 5 Clients and 5 Members in each group purchasing a total of 500.00 worth of product per group . The IBO s direct customers are continuing to generate 500.00 in sales with a retail mark up of 75.00 see Example 1 . Thus the total group volume is 2 000.00 per month 1 500.00 500.00 resulting in a Net Performance Bonus of for example 131.97 calculated in a similar manner as in Example 1. Net Performance Bonus is the difference in Performance Bonus that is earned on the total sales by the total group and that earned by each of the sponsored IBO s. Therefore the IBO s monthly income Performance Bonus and retail mark up totals 206.97 131.97 Performance Bonus 75.00 Retail mark up . If this performance level is maintained by the entire group for 12 consecutive months the IBO s annual income would be 2 483.64.

If each of the three personally sponsored IBO s described in Example 2 each personally sponsor two additional IBO s resulting in sales of 6 groups 500.00 3 000.00 and the entire group continues to generate the same sales volume i.e. 2 000.00 the original IBO s income will further increase as described below.

Each of the IBO s personally sponsored IBO s would continue to generate 1 500.00 in sales volume as shown above while the IBO s direct customers are continuing to generate 500.00 in sales. In addition the newly sponsored groups are each generating 500.00 in sales for a total of 3 000.00 6 groups 500.00 group 3 000.00 . Thus the entire group would have sales totaling 5 000.00. The Net Performance Bonus based on this volume would be 337.25 calculated in a similar manner to Example 1 which in addition to the 75.00 retail mark up would result in monthly income of 412.25. Again assuming that everyone in the group meets these performance levels for 12 consecutive months the IBO s annual income is 4 947.00.

If each of two additional IBO s described in Example 3 each add one more IBO and everyone continues to generate the same sales volume the original IBO s income will increase as described below.

Each of the IBO s personally sponsored IBO s now generates 2 500.00 in sales volume 5 groups 500.00 while the IBO s entire group has sales totaling 8 000.00 3 groups 2 500.00 plus the IBO s direct sales of 500.00 . The Net Performance Bonus based on this volume is 527.85 which in addition to the 75.00 retail mark up results in monthly income of 602.85. Again assuming that everyone in the group meets these performance levels for 12 consecutive months the IBO s annual income is 7 234.00.

If three additional IBO s are added and each build similar organizations to those described above then total group volume is 15 500.00 6 groups 2 500.00 plus the IBO s direct sales of 500.00 . The Net Performance Bonus based on this volume is 1 725.29 which in addition to the 75.00 retail mark up results in monthly income of 1 800.29. Again assuming that everyone in the group meets these performance levels for 12 consecutive months the IBO s annual income is 21 603.00.

If three additional IBO s are added to those described above who each sponsor two IBOs and each of those two sponsor another IBO the total group volume is 23 000.00 9 groups 2 500.00 plus the IBO s direct sales of 500.00 . The Net Performance Bonus based on this volume would be 2 981.38 which in addition to the 75.00 retail mark up would result in monthly income of 3 056.38. Again assuming that everyone in the group could meet these performance levels for 12 consecutive months the IBO s annual income would be 36 676.00.

Such an organization would also qualify the IBO as a Platinum IBO if the IBO could maintain this group performance for a specified period of time for example but not limited to 6 months. As a Platinum IBO there may be additional methods by which income may be earned based upon certain qualification levels and standards.

As can be seen from the previous examples as an IBO continues to develop his or her business larger amounts of income may be obtained either from additional purchases by those within his or her direct sponsor group direct sales made to end user customers or sales made by the marketing company to the customers. Various scheduling rates could be used for apportioning such bonuses and commissions to the IBO and the present invention is not limited to any particular rate or system. In addition the IBO may earn special bonuses or qualify for special status depending upon the size of his or her personal group and the total sales generated by that group for example when the IBO qualifies as a Platinum IBO.

The logical architecture defines the preferred hardware and software components utilized to support the E Commerce experience as embodied in the present invention. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a multi tier system architecture is used based on logical tiers best seen in .

A presentation layer preferably provides the physical representation of the system to the user and is divided into two sections the user interface not shown and the management interface not shown . The user is able to browse marketing system product catalogs manage their membership and place orders by using the user interface of the presentation. The management tools provide groups within the E Commerce Web Site to access the systems in a safe and structured fashion. The Active Server Pages ASP and HTML pages allow the user and management interfaces to interact with the database and other programs. Moreover Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP is the set of rules for exchanging files for example text graphic images sound video and other multimedia files via the user and management interfaces on the World Wide Web.

A business layer is preferably a logical layer that enables the marketing system to disengage business logic and rules from the data or user interfaces. By disassociating business logic the marketing system is better able to manage changes in the business that must be implemented at the system level. Further business layer can be used to serve multiple clients and purposes. For example business logic residing in business layer that validates an order on the E Commerce web site could also be used to validate orders that are placed by non web based systems. In one embodiment business layer is implemented through the use of COM objects that share information through defined interfaces. Preferably each interface provides one or more functions that another object or a program can call such as but not limited to validating the orders as noted above.

A data layer is preferably a logical layer where the data for the system is captured and preserved. Data layer is preferably independent of the other layers and makes no assumptions about the existence of the other layers. The technology and design used to implement data layer can be changed without causing the other layers to undergo a major revision if any revision at all . Data layer can be implemented by for example but not limited to Legacy systems or SQL servers.

The software and hardware specified for the infrastructure configuration detailed above is the preferred underlying architecture for the entire E Commerce network of the present invention. A combination of Microsoft BackOffice products are also preferably used to provide feature content as well as authentication of member users on the E Commerce site. These exemplary products include the following 

The conventional Microsoft Site Server Membership Services model of authentication allows for a highly secure site with further ability to scale audit and track users as site use flourishes. In one embodiment the site co exists securely with existing Legacy systems in a dual fire walled de militarized zone DMZ partition best seen in . The E Commerce servers are preferably logically separated from the existing mainframe environment as to minimize potential security risks and exposure to unauthorized access.

There are eight preferred components for the individual page web files or sites of the present invention as shown in . These exemplary components include the following 

Supporting these sites requires the availability of content deployment that preferably includes the following exemplary items 

The main area of the E Commerce web site as shown in preferably provides Web shoppers with a starting point from which they can navigate through the site in a well known manner. The navigation is provided by a plurality of web files associated with web site . In a preferred embodiment the site is served up to shoppers differently depending on their membership or participation level. Merchandizing offers for example are targeted differently to each membership class i.e. Client Member Member Plus or Independent Business Owner IBO . The primary navigation features links to the following exemplary areas 

There is a link to the Income options site or page web file which allows shoppers to find out more about IBO status and the opportunity to become an independent business associated with the marketing company. It also provides a quick and easy registration method for becoming an Independent Business Owner. This assumes there is an existing link with an IBO. In a preferred embodiment the income options page web file comprises a multimedia presentation and information relating to the marketing system.

A Go Shopping option can provide links to one of the stores within the marketing system e.g. Health Home and Self or Store for More shopping site or any partner stores or the equivalent thereof.

There preferably is a link to a site search page from the primary navigational menu. Site search page allows a user to enter common terms and or phrases and searches for those terms or phrases within the E Commerce web site.

A customer service menu for example on customer service page features a link to a contact us page that features an e mail form that allows shoppers to send in their comments about the Web site.

Existing registered Clients Members Members Plus and IBOs are able to sign in with a number assigned by the marketing company IMC Number and password from the primary navigation menu. When a non referred customer that is a customer that has not been referred to the site by a Member Member Plus or IBO reaches the point in the site where they must be associated with an IBO a leads generation module will be invoked. This process assigns the new customer to an existing IBO if specified by the customer the application will prompt for association to an existing IBO prior to invoking the leads generation module . If there is no existing IBO relationship then the leads generation module will assign a customer to an IBO based on one or more criteria preferably to choose from a select group of IBO s. As noted above such criteria can include but are not limited to the following 

1 The IBO is a Direct Fulfillment Founders Direct IBO. A Direct Fulfillment IBO is one who preferably utilizes the company s direct shipment method by which products are drop shipped directly to the Client or Member rather than being delivered through the IBO. A Founders Direct IBO is an IBO that has achieved a particularly high level of business activity as an IBO 

The customer will then be given the IBO s contact information with an option check box or suitable mechanism to indicate if the customer wishes the IBO to contact them. Otherwise the assignment is essentially transparent from the customer s perspective and the IBO will only see volume on their monthly reports. A generic name like web customer or similar name is used to insulate the client information in this scenario.

There is preferably a link to the Member Perks site from the primary navigational menu. In a preferred embodiment members are allowed to register within the member perks site .

Exemplary merchant partners which may be included as a link from the E Commerce Web site include but are not limited to the following

There is preferably a link to the New Business Ventures NBV from the primary navigational menu. NBV can comprise information regarding new business ventures between the marketing company and new business partners or alternatively could provide links to new business partner web sites for additional information.

The Income options Web site or income options page web file preferably provides online material that describes the E Commerce shopping opportunities to new shoppers and allows quick and easy IBO sign up for prospects. The site serves as for example but not limited to a recruiting tool for Independent Business Owners giving them a place to send prospects for more information. In a preferred embodiment shown in the income options page web file comprises interactive presentations and a link to a process for signing up to qualify as an IBO .

The Income options page web file also preferably includes a collection of presentations and informational pages about the various marketing system opportunities. In a preferred embodiment the presentation materials are in a multimedia format and the income options page web file includes an interactive presentation that allows an individual or prospective IBO to view an income based on a quantity of sales of marketing system products and services sold through the marketing system. In other words it allows a prospective Member to explore the business opportunity of becoming an IBO. In such an embodiment the prospective Member is presented with for example a series of dialog boxes as shown in and that allow the prospective member to enter the following four data items 

 4 Estimated sponsor group number wherein the sponsor group number represents a number of individuals to be sponsored by the prospective

Member or that the prospective Member could interest in becoming an IBO. It should be understood by one of skill in the art that each of dialog boxes could include a drop down menu that would allow the prospective member to choose from a predetermined selection. These drop down menus could be provided by various means which are well known in the art.

Each of these four data items can be iterated by the prospective Member to evaluate various combinations. Subsequent screens presented to the prospective Member explain how a selected income level can be achieved based upon the number of customers sales level to the customers and sponsoring of other IBO s that in turn have customers and sponsor yet other IBO s. An exemplary screen is shown in . In this manner a prospective Member can see how the combination of data items 2 4 result in income data item 1 .

An exemplary iterative method based on the information provided by the prospective member is described below. It should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that such an iterative method comprises a large part of a sales and marketing plan described in further detail below which can be presented to users through use of the present invention. To begin the number of potential customers is multiplied by the estimated sales to obtain a total sales figure. The number of customers would also be multiplied by a retail price of the product or service to obtain a total retail price. The total retail price is subtracted from the total sales figure to obtain a total discount sales income. Next a total point value PV and total business volume BV are calculated based on the total sales figure. A performance bonus income is then calculated based on a combination of the total point value and the total business volume. The performance bonus income is next added to the total discount sales income to obtain a total income. This total income is finally presented to the prospective Member. The calculation shown in is the same as that described above in Example 1.

These steps can then be repeated using the sponsor group information provided by the prospective Member to calculate total sponsor group bonus income which when added to the total discount sales income noted above would give the prospective Member a total sponsor group income. This total sponsor group income can then be recalculated based on a revised sponsor group number which would represent how the prospective Member s business would grow by adding more registered users to his or her own personal group. An exemplary screen presented to the user following the iterative process described above is shown in . An example of how the data shown in is calculated is shown above in Example 2.

As noted above the income options page web file may also offer a link to a multimedia overview that provides further description of these opportunities and the marketing company s plan. Exemplary plans could include but are not limited to the Sales and Marketing Plan or any other marketing company plan information.

In one embodiment of the present invention the Sales and Marketing Plan is a marketing method by which an IBO builds an independent business. The Sales and Marketing Plan is unique and based on two fundamental concepts selling and sponsoring others who sell. In a preferred embodiment the Sales and Marketing Plan of the present invention combines a marketing business with a membership buying opportunity. This is accomplished using either or both electronic commerce and face to face transactions. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to any particular sales and marketing plan or any particular method by which an IBO builds an independent business.

The primary navigation features within the income options page may also preferably provide links to additional exemplary areas including the following 

The purpose of the Goals area is to provide prospects with several reasons why they should become an Independent Business Owner. This section explains how to get started creating an E Commerce business.

Electronic Retailing is the selling of retail goods on the Internet. The Electronic Retailing section provides facts statistics and demographics of Electronic Retailing on the Internet in an effort to encourage prospects to sign up to become an Independent Business Owner.

The rewards section provides information about online marketing and promotions offered to members in an effort to encourage prospects to sign up to become an Independent Business Owner.

To encourage prospects to start their own Electronic Retailing business the resource area provides information about all of the online resources available to Independent Business Owners for managing a business. These resources include but are not limited to access to the Virtual Office up to the minute news and information about a business network marketing tips and business partnerships that are available.

The Keep Me Posted area is a form that shoppers can fill out to be notified of new products and business opportunities available from the E Commerce site.

In an alternative embodiment of the present invention shoppers can complete a quick and easy registration form to become a member or an Independent Business Owner within the Income options page. Clients and Members are preferably assigned a Marketing Company IMC number either through an association with an existing Member Plus or Independent Business Owner or through integration with the Leads Generation module. The IMC number establishes a profile and at the same time associates them with a Member Plus or IBO.

In a preferred embodiment basic content available within the income options page web file does not change based on the user s registration or participation level. However one s participation level i.e. Client Member Member Plus IBO can affect access to some resources for example but not limited to the interactive presentations. Each of the participation levels are discussed herein below with respect to its capabilities within the income options page web file.

A non registered user who has found the income options page web file independently or through referral from a Client Member Member Plus or IBO but has not yet initiated a transaction e.g. become a registered Client or become a Member may be curious about becoming an IBO or may just be curious about how the business works. He or she preferably enters from the main web site page or from the navigational bar on any E commerce web page to an opening page for the Income options area. The unknown prospect is preferably free to go to anywhere within the Income options area. Links to all areas are preferably visible.

If upon perusing the site the unknown prospect wants to become a member the prospect may go to Sign up where the prospect may sign up as a Member or IBO. If the prospect does not indicate an IBO sponsor then the Leads Generation module will assign the prospect to an IBO as described herein. However the unknown prospect may also desire to know more about the business opportunity and decide to view an online description of the Sales and Marketing Plan. Upon clicking on the appropriate link the prospect is presented with a logon screen. If the prospect has been referred by an IBO the prospect simply types in the required information for example but not limited to an IBO number and access code and is redirected to a multimedia presentation and other supporting materials. This form will then pass through the Leads generation program or module. The leads generation program will respond with contact information to an IBO who can explain the Sales and Marketing Plan or enable the prospect to view the Sales and Marketing Plan online.

A registered Client preferably has the same use options and patterns which are not that different from that of the unknown prospect. The Client may have come to the Income options area from curiosity or may have been referred to this section by a sponsoring IBO. The Client s experience with the Income options module will differ from that of the unknown prospect in that the Client is an authenticated user with an existing profile. If the registered Client wants to become a Member Member Plus or IBO the sign up function will lead them through a process to enable them to view the Sales and Marketing Plan online and sign up as either a Member Member Plus or IBO as applicable through their existing sponsoring IBO.

A Member preferably has the same use options and patterns as a Client. The Member may have come to the Income options area from curiosity or may have been referred to this section by their sponsoring IBO. The goal of the Income options page web file is different however with the Member. The goal is to entice the existing Member who is already familiar with the marketing system into the business opportunity. If the Member wants to become an IBO the sign up function will lead them through an appropriate process.

An IBO comes to the Income options module as an authenticated user. The IBO is preferably able to access any material within the page web file and is able to view the online Sales and Marketing Plan without having to authenticate again. The IBO is allowed to use an additional piece of functionality an on line form that allows the IBO to add or change access codes to be given to prospects or existing Clients and Members for access to the online Sales and Marketing Plan. The link to this function is preferably not shown to users who are not IBOs.

The General Shopping section preferably provides the user interaction associated with all of the E Commerce features.

Once a WWW shopper has entered the marketing company E Commerce site they are able to shop in a convenient and efficient manner provided by one or more shopping page web files associated with the web site. In one embodiment the system initially checks to determine if the shopper has ever been to the site before. This check is performed by the system through the use of for example identifying cookies left on the shopper s personal computer from the most previous shopping session. If it is determined that the shopper has been to the site before the shopper is prompted to confirm their identity. The system then recalls any existing site personalization and proceeds with membership authentication as described in more detail below. Greetings from the server computer using the user s stored last and first names may also be presented to the user following log in and authentication procedures. In an alternate embodiment the user simply enters his or her user name and password and the system checks the information for authentication of the user.

In a preferred embodiment membership authentication and personalization information is stored in a central repository on the server computer. This information is passed from the server computer to an associated membership server computer via a Secure Socket Layer SSL connection by any method known to those having skill in the art.

If the WWW shopper has been authenticated the system then automatically determines the shopper s membership type and personalization for example a Client Member or IBO. In a preferred embodiment this profile determines how the site is rendered to the registered shopper including what product price services and merchandizing the shopper sees. For new unregistered shoppers the navigational menu provides registration and membership opportunities.

New user registration or authentication may also occur at other areas within the E Commerce web site of the present invention. Exemplary areas in which registration or authentication may occur are when an unregistered user i.e. Surfer attempts to link to a merchant partner attempts to enter the member perks page web file attempts to enter the Virtual Office web page or attempts to redeem a digital coupon. When a user reaches a URL for which they do not have access a typical web server s default behavior is to display a generic error page. In order to provide a seamless experience however the present invention replaces the default error page with a customized authentication redirector AR page.

Referring now to a flow chart depicts the functionality of the authentication redirector page. At the AR page in step if a user does not have an authentication identifier such as an authentication cookie the AR page will redirect the user to a marketing page web file associated with the web site. Marketing page web file describes the benefits of different levels of membership etc. If in step the user has an authentication cookie then in step it is determined if the cookie identifies the user as a surfer or anonymous user. If the user s cookie identifies the user as a surfer or anonymous user then the page will again redirect the user to marketing page . If the user has a cookie but is not a surfer or anonymous user e.g. the user is a registered customer then the AR page will determine a participation level of the user i.e. Client Member Member Plus or IBO for example . If the participation level of the user meets a predetermined access level for a given web page file which the user wishes to access e.g. access is given to IBOs and Members Plus but not Members or Client then the user is granted access to the web page file. If the user s participation level does not meet the predetermined access level e.g. a user who is a Client in the above noted example then the authentication redirector directs the user to a web page file explaining that the user s current membership level does not have access to the resources or web page file requested. Preferably page also includes marketing information to encourage the user to upgrade to a higher membership level. It should be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art that the above described authentication redirector functionality is different than merely a registered user improperly entering his or her username or password wherein the user is redirected back to the user sign in page as is known in the art. The authentication redirector functionality of the present invention navigates the user through the site based upon the user s participation level and access rights. If the user is denied access the AR functionality of the present invention allows the user to change their participation level and access rights by presenting an appropriate web page to the user. This functionality provides a user friendly improvement over conventional systems that display an error page web file to a user when access is denied.

In general WWW shoppers are able to browse through the product hierarchy and or search for items using the E Commerce product search component. As part of the main navigation a general E Commerce search icon is available on all E Commerce screens. Shoppers are able to type in the SKU or identification number or product names across all products available. The feature will search for SKUs or product names across all web stores presented to the user. Each match will be displayed on a single line that preferably contains the product long name price and a link to the full product page. An appropriate message will be displayed if no items are found. In a further embodiment of the present invention this search feature is extended to include non commerce related items. In yet a further embodiment custom queries on the database are generated to determine aspects such as common customer searches.

WWW shoppers are also preferably able to search and add to their shopping cart specific product SKUs or identification numbers. This search feature takes the consumer to the associated product page. Here the consumer finds for example a product picture description educational and use content as well as price. An icon in the general navigational menu also allows them to add the item to their standing order based on membership type . From the main product page users can click to other main product pages for products in the same category.

Shown in a product list is used for product browsing and shopping. Product list is preferably built and maintained at the server computer. A preferred product list includes for example but is not limited to a product name and price and PV and BV for each product. In a preferred embodiment only IBOs will see PV and BV for each product. Clients preferably see an additional piece of information called Member cost . Member cost is used to entice the Client to become a registered Member. Member cost is typically less than a retail price paid by the Client Member Cost less than Your Cost . As shown a product image link is also provided. Product image link preferably provides a link to a product image and detail page not shown which preferably includes a picture and details about the specific product. A link View Next 25 Products is also provided which allows the user to view the next 25 items appearing in product list via the user s browser.

Again referring to in order to select a product for purchase a user fills in a quantity on product list . Upon selecting the quantities for purchase for a plurality of products the user can then initiate the Add to Basket link by double clicking a mouse for example to add the selected products to a shopping basket.

An exemplary shopping basket display page is shown in . As can be seen in shopping basket display page includes information about particular products and services selected for purchase including but not limited to quantity SKU product name PV BV Member cost Your cost and total price . Preferably Member cost is only available to Clients from shopping basket page . In addition it is preferable that only IBOs be able to view PV and BV from shopping basket page . In order to update a desired quantity the user must enter a new quantity in one of the quantity fields and click the Update Basket button .

Shopping basket page preferably includes additional links to Return Continue Checkout and Standing Order . By choosing Return the user is returned to the preceding page from which the user chose to view shopping basket page . Exemplary preceding pages could include but is not limited to for example a product image and detail page or the product list page of . By choosing Continue Checkout the user is presented with Shipping info see below . If the user has not authenticated at the time of choosing Continue Checkout then the user is forwarded to a login create new user page not shown .

By choosing Standing Order the user is forwarded to a screen that allows the user to create a new standing order profile. Typically a standing order profile allows a user to set up an automated order system that sends products and or services to the user at regular intervals which are selected by the user. Such standing orders provide an efficient method for establishing long term orders of products and or services from the marketing system. All items in shopping basket page are placed in the new profile. User then has the option of removing items from the newly created profile.

In a preferred embodiment a billing shipping page not shown is presented to the user upon the user s selection of Continue Checkout from shopping basket page as described above. Shipping page preferably includes an area allowing the user to enter shipping and address information. As noted above users must be authenticated to view this page. In the preferred embodiment the billing shipping page includes all profile information pre populated into the appropriate fields of the page. If necessary the user may overwrite this information. Additionally users have the option of having the shipping information the same as or different from their profile information stored at the server computer. Like shopping basket page the shipping page includes links similar to Return and Continue Checkout as described above. In addition conventional information fields can be made available for weight based shipping.

Once a user proceeds to checkout the registered user is forwarded to an order preview page. An exemplary order preview page is shown in . As can be seen in order preview page includes information about particular products and services purchased including but not limited to quantity SKU product name Stock Status PV BV Your cost and total price . Stock Status presents information relating to the availability of the products and services purchased. Such information can include but is not limited to whether the product is in stock or on back order. The purpose of order preview page is to show the total of the order with shipping and tax and to allow the input of the various payment method and related information . As shown the user may proceed with the order if all information is correct by selecting the Purchase button .

Upon selection of the purchase button a confirmation page not shown is then displayed which includes a Thank You for the order and an order identification number. The confirmation page also reminds the customer that a confirmation electronic notification e.g. email with order confirmation invoice number will be sent.

The present invention also provides the ability for those who order online to complete their order and call an 800 number to provide their credit card information in a well known manner.

The present invention also provides the ability to provide automatic shipments. Automatic shipments are preferably used to instruct the marketing company to automatically ship product to make up a lack of volume up to a specific percent for certain qualifications. If the marketing company determines the IBO for example has missed the specified qualification as well as incentive program qualifications if applicable an order is prepared from a list of predetermined product shipped and billed by electronic bank draft or credit card.

The E Commerce shopping page web files of the present invention preferably also include help pages to assist users unfamiliar with the online shopping process. In addition all order related pages provide customer service contact information as will be discussed in more detail below.

As noted above authentication is preferably necessary to place an order in addition to such information as name bill to ship to payment or other similar information. There is registration information that is required regardless of the particular membership type. This information includes but is not limited to the following 

There are also a variety of optional registration features for each membership type exemplary of these types of features include the following 

The E Commerce site of the present invention is available to any WWW shopper general Web Surfer Client Member Member Plus or IBO . As noted above the user s membership type preferably determines the level of access to products and services that will appear during the shopping experience. The particular shopper is able to access the site using any of the following exemplary methods 

Via the main E Commerce page. The standard navigation throughout the entire E Commerce site provides links to all web shopping sites presented to the user 

Unique URL for each shopping site. Each web shopping site has a unique URL which a user can type directly from a browser window to access the site 

IBO links. IBO sites provide links to specific shopping sites or product pages for their Members. An IBO may provide an individual web page for his or her own business or group that allows the members of the IBO s group to access the web site. The site preferably provides information and other services to the members.

Electronic or digital coupon e mail links. Electronic or digital coupons are delivered to WWW Shoppers as an e mail message. These coupons can also have links to product pages or special deals.

As noted above the site preferably appears differently based on the particular user s type i.e. Web Surfer Client Member Member Plus Independent Business Owner . The site first checks for a cookie as described above when a user enters to determine if they are a registered user. If the user has visited the site before the system will automatically pull up their profile.

If the system cannot determine if the user has been to the site before then the user will be able to register either as an existing or new user from the general navigation bar. Registration is optional until checkout at which time the system forces the user to register as an existing or new user. Users who have forgotten their password are able to request forgotten password hint information from a help page. The online registration process can be integrated to an existing marketing company computer system for assignment of IBO numbers and integration to an Automated Lead Generation Program module. Mainframe transactions are interfaced to obtain IMC number.

With regard to new user registration the present invention requires a minimum amount of information to be provided. Exemplary information includes but is not limited to a valid e mail address user specified password home address and phone number. Upon registration of new users an IMC number and or IBO number is assigned to the new user.

Existing users who have already registered on the site but are not automatically known by the system are able to register by entering their username and password. Incorrect passwords or forgotten usernames will direct users to a help password hint HTML page which will prompt the user to enter his or her last name and email address. The e mail address must be valid. When this information is looked up and verified in the member database the user s password hint is displayed and a form field is displayed for the user to enter his or her password hint answer. Once this form is submitted the password hint answer is compared. If it matches the user id and password are displayed on the user s browser system screen. Alternatively this information is sent to the user via an email message. If it is not correct the user has the option of calling customer support. The data is preferably passed over a secure connection such as secure sockets layer SSL .

Once a user has registered they may administer their own registration information. This includes changing a password and other registration information. Access to this registration information is through the Member Benefits section.

Registered users are transparently assigned a profile that holds contact information such as address phone and e mail address. Users are asked for additional information in each main store to build on their perpetual profile. Profiles contain any information filled out on line or through specific questionnaires and purchasing habits. Member profiles also determine how the site appears to the user what products can be purchased product prices special deals purchasing incentives etc. In addition real time click stream information is collected and maintained such as but not limited to purchase histories and page web files visited.

In this regard shoppers are presented with an incentive to personalize the site. When a registered shopper comes to the site they can change the default personalization profile features such as e mail reminders. To help the shopper understand how profile personalization works and how it will benefit them there is a link to a profiling assistant. Each registered user has a profile for the primary member. The primary member has the option of setting up and administering additional profiles i.e. for family members . Once a user has registered they are also able to modify their profile information. It is preferred that the profile information is passed back to the host system or server computer for retention however other well known retention systems may also be employed.

As noted above as part of personalizing the site a personal greeting is generated from the information in the member profile. The personal greeting welcomes new users to the site once they have registered and also welcomes previous users back to the site. The personal greeting also can point out new products or special offers.

From the main product pages users can browse other main product pages in the same category. The main product page contains an image of the item a two or three paragraph description of the product retail and member pricing and an optional link to a complete product page description that includes usage and educational content. Typically consumers navigate to the main product page through the product hierarchy or the product search.

Various product pages have a link to a more descriptive product page. This page may contain multiple images as well as more detailed product text. In some instances this link may reference the MSDS Material Safety Data Sheets sheets and other product information sheets in the Virtual Office download area.

Shoppers are able to select products for purchase by placing them in their electronic shopping cart in a similar fashion to retail shopping carts. However in contrast to conventional retail shopping carts a shopper can add items to a single shopping cart from multiple stores within the E Commerce site. A single shopping cart and single checkout can be used for purchasing items from the marketing company stores and from the merchant partner sites. It should be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art however that any number of shopping carts can be used in the present invention but a single shopping cart is preferred.

A product may be added to the shopping cart by selecting a button from the main product page. Consumers may add modify and delete items in their shopping cart. As part of the selection the consumer is able to specify an item quantity or place the item on a standing order. When viewing the shopping cart the consumer is able to see the long name price and quantity of the particular product. Clicking the long name preferably provides a link to the product page. In one embodiment of the present invention the shopping cart comprises a list of marketing system products and services selected for purchase by a Client Member Member Plus and IBO via a shopping page web file. Preferably the list is maintained at the server computer and is updated each time a new product or service is selected for purchase by the Client Member Member Plus and IBO.

WWW shoppers are alerted in the shopping cart preferably after checkout when a particular item can be placed on standing order. This feature is dependent upon the particular membership type. Shoppers have the option to put an item on standing order from the shopping cart.

According to the present invention there is a persistent shopping cart for the web shopping stores shopping page web files allowing registered users to purchase products and services from the marketing company i.e. Home Health and Self as well as the Store for More store. In a preferred embodiment there is a persistent shopping cart for the web stores and the merchant partners. This means that a shopper can add items to a single shopping cart from multiple stores within the marketing company E Commerce site. Products from both the web stores and the Store for More store are then processed and fulfilled via one order. This adds to the overall efficiency of the present invention and provides a user friendly environment for the web shopper. The persistent shopping cart also transverses the sites of other sellers participating in the E commerce facility so a shopper can buy multiple product lines from multiple suppliers in a single virtual shopping transaction.

As marketing system products and services are selected for purchase by the registered Client Member Member Plus and IBO a list is accumulated and maintained at the server computer. An exemplary list includes information included on shopping basket page shown in . As each subsequent request for a marketing system product and service is received at the server computer the product or service is added to the list to create an updated list of marketing system products and services selected for purchase. As such as the user adds products or services to the shopping basket the server computer maintains an updated list so that all products may be purchased from multiple sources in a single virtual shopping transaction.

It is envisioned by the present invention that there may be times when the consumer adds items to a basket and then leaves the site before checking out. In such cases the present invention can purge or clean out orphaned shopping carts or preserve the contents of the shopping cart and contact or email the particular shopper to inquire whether they wish to complete the purchase.

Accordingly in a preferred embodiment a session is established when a registered user accesses the E Commerce web site. Likewise the session is terminated when each registered user terminates access to the E Commerce web site. At the server computer the updated list of marketing system products and services selected for purchase via the plurality of shopping page web files is maintained for a holding period that begins when the registered user terminates the session with the E Commerce site without purchasing the contents of the shopping basket i.e. the user abandons the cart . In the preferred embodiment the list is maintained at the server computer for a holding period of at least 30 days. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the holding period can be less than or greater than 30 days depending upon the particulars of the marketing system and the economics of maintaining orphaned carts.

According to the preferred embodiment a dormant period is tracked preferably by the server computer. The dormant period preferably begins when the registered user terminates the session. If no marketing system products and services are added to the updated list during the dormant period then an electronic notification for example an email is sent to the registered user at the expiration of the dormant period. It is preferred that the electronic notification includes a message to the user that the marketing system products and services in the updated list i.e. the shopping basket will be deleted following a deletion period if no additional products and services are added to the updated list or a purchase is not made by the user. The deletion period preferably begins at the expiration of the dormant period. In the preferred embodiment the dormant period and the deletion period are each at least 15 days. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the dormant period and the deletion period can each be less than or greater than 15 days depending upon the particulars of the marketing system and the economics of maintaining orphaned carts.

In a preferred embodiment if a registered user at some point during the dormant period adds any number of marketing system products and services to the updated list then the dormant period is preferably reset for example to zero or zero days to the beginning of the period at the end of the user s session. This reset dormant period can be referred to as a second dormant period. The second dormant period can have the same or different duration that the original or first dormant period. Again if no marketing system products and services are added to the updated list during the second dormant period then an electronic notification is sent to the registered user at the expiration of the second dormant period. As described above the electronic notification includes a message notifying the user that the marketing system products and services in the updated list will be deleted following a deletion period if no additional products and services are added to the updated list or a purchase is not made by the user. If a user does add a product to the list during the deletion period then preferably both the dormant period and the deletion periods are reset. Alternately only the deletion period is reset.

In a preferred embodiment the dormant period can be reset for example three times before the cart is emptied and the periods canceled. It should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the dormant period could be reset any number of times.

Moreover if the user at any time during the dormant period or the deletion period chooses to purchase the items in the list then in a preferred embodiment both the dormant and deletion periods pertaining to the particular orphaned cart are stopped or canceled. It should be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art that various adjustments can be made to the holding deletion and dormant periods to accommodate numerous variations of time periods depending again upon the particulars of the marketing system and the economics of maintaining orphaned carts.

The rewards value for a particular product or service may have the same or different value than the redemption value for that product or service.

In the preferred embodiment a registered Client Member Member Plus or IBO is provided with an on line order form which can be the same as or similar to the form described above with respect to shopping which allows purchase redemption from the catalog. In addition a registered Client Member Member Plus or IBO is also provided with an on line redemption form which also allows purchase redemption from the catalog. In this fashion the user is allowed to purchase or redeem items from the catalog using the payment method described above or using points which have been earned from previous product purchases.

Each of the on line order form and on line redemption form can be in the form of the shopping basket form described above with respect to shopping and as shown in . It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any suitable on line form may be used in the present invention as long as the form provides a convenient method for allowing a registered Client Member Member Plus or IBO to purchase products and redeem points for products. Likewise it should be apparent to one of skill in the art that separate on line forms can be used to carry out the purchase redemption function or a single form can be used.

When a registered user submits a rewards exchange request for marketing system products and services via the on line redemption form a redemption value corresponding to the marketing system products and services chosen by the registered Client Member Member Plus and IBO is preferably subtracted from a rewards database . Rewards database is preferably maintained on the server computer for storing reward points corresponding to a registered Client Member Member Plus and IBO and a type identifier . Type identifier is preferably a value associated with one of a Client Member Member Plus and IBO. An exemplary type identifier is a string selected from the group consisting of Client Member Member Plus and IBO. As such the rewards database allows the system to keep up with the total number of rewards points accumulated by the registered user.

In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention catalog includes an accrual record and a redemption record . Accrual record preferably includes a product number a type identifier and an accrual value for the product number. Type identifier is preferably a value associated with one of a Client Member Member Plus and IBO. An exemplary type identifier is a string selected from the group consisting of Client Member Member Plus and IBO. In the preferred embodiment accrual record comprises an accrual value for each type identifier. In this fashion as a registered Client Member Member Plus and IBO purchases products he or she will accumulate accrual values differently based upon the particular participation level. These accrual values are then transferred into rewards points and stored in rewards catalog .

Likewise redemption record preferably includes a product number a type identifier and a redemption value for the product number. Type identifier is preferably a value associated with one of the Client Member Member Plus and IBO. An exemplary type identifier is a string selected from the group consisting of Client Member Member Plus and IBO. In the preferred embodiment redemption record comprises a redemption value for each type identifier. In this fashion as a registered Client Member Member Plus and IBO purchases products he or she will use redemption values differently based upon the particular participation level.

The following illustrates an exemplary purchase and redemption as set forth by the present invention. It should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the example that follows is for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed to limit the present invention. A registered customer purchases a product which for the sake of simplicity will be referred to herein as product A from the marketing company. Product A has an accrual value equal to for example 150 points for a type corresponding to a Member. Alternatively for example product A can have an accrual value equal to 200 points for a type corresponding to a Member Plus or 100 for type corresponding to a Client. This accrual value is added to the rewards points value maintained in rewards database thereby increasing the user s rewards points by 150 points. If the user later wishes to redeem the 150 points for another product or service having a redemption value of 150 points or less the user initiates the process as described herein above. In response redemption value which may be less than or equal to 150 points is then subtracted from rewards points in rewards database . In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention redemption value for the redeemed product may be for example 150 points for a Member 100 points for a Member Plus and 200 points for a Client. This process may then be continued for subsequent purchases and or redemptions.

Additionally information relating to sales of marketing system products and services to the IBO and sales of marketing system products and services by the IBO can be provided to the IBO.

Additionally many IBOs prefer to view the total point values and business volumes being generated by individuals in their personal groups. In order to accomplish this the present invention totals individual point values PV assigned to the marketing system products and services sold to and by one of the registered users to achieve a total individual point value. The invention further totals individual business volumes BV assigned to the marketing system products and services sold to and by one of the registered users to achieve a total individual business volume. The IBO can then view the total individual point value and the total individual business volume via the virtual office page web file.

In another embodiment the present invention allows the IBO to view the total PV associated with sales made by and to the IBO and the total BV associated with sales made by and to the IBO. As described above the total point values for each product sold by and to the IBO is added to the total business volumes for each product sold by and to the IBO. These values are then added together to allow the IBO to view his own personal total PV and BV values.

In another embodiment the present invention allows the IBO to view the total PV associated with sales made by and to the IBO s personal group and the total BV associated with sales made by and to the IBO s personal group. As described above the total point values for each product sold by and to the IBO s personal group is added to the total business volumes for each product sold by and to the IBO s personal group. These values are then added together to allow the IBO to view his personal group s total PV and BV values.

In another embodiment the present invention adds the IBO s personal group s total PV and BV values to those of the individual IBO to obtain a total group PV and a total group BV. This of course would contain all products and services sold to and by the IBO and sold to and by the IBO s personal group. These values are then presented to the IBO upon the IBO s request to view his or her total group PV and BV.

In another embodiment the present invention establishes a plurality of escalating levels wherein the escalating levels are preferably a function of sales and marketing products and services. For example a level may be based on a total volume of sales of marketing system products and services. Therefore as more products and services are sold the higher the level can be attained.

Within the office page web file as noted above an interactive calculation method for example an electronic calculator is preferably provided. The interactive calculation method allows the IBO to determine a quantity or volume of sales needed to reach one of the plurality of escalating levels. In a preferred embodiment the IBO can use the interactive calculation method to determine a quantity or volume of sales needed by one of the individuals in the IBO s personal group to reach one of the plurality of levels. This information can then be used by the IBO to help each of the individuals in the IBO s personal group meet the next sales challenge and to provide them with the help that they need. In this fashion each of the pieces of information provided by the office page web file aids the IBO in growing the IBO s personal business via the E Commerce web site of the present invention.

The E Commerce Web site of the present invention also preferably provides a variety of customer service functions in order to minimize the need for shoppers to make a phone call for assistance. Exemplary functions are described hereinafter.

In the preferred embodiment customer service is an option from the main navigation in the E Commerce web site and is available in all areas associated with the web site. It is preferred that customer service option be available to all visitors to the web site.

A layout of an exemplary customer service page web file is shown in . In a preferred embodiment customer service page web file includes a plurality of associate page web files including a How to use file an About Us file which describes for example the marketing company of the present invention a Placing an Order file which describes how to place an order an About My Order file which includes information about prior or existing orders a Contact Us file which includes contact information for the marketing company a Edit Profile file which allows the user to edit their personal information which has been previously provided by the user and a Forgot Password file which allows the user to lookup their password in case they have forgotten it.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention when a user selects the Customer Service file from within the web site the user receives a personal greeting from a Virtual Customer Service Representative VCSR as can best be seen in . VCSR is preferably an image of an individual portrayed as a Customer Service Representative CSR on a helpline. As the user selects areas of Customer Service to view the same CSR will remain with the user but new images of the same CSR appears. The VCSR provides the user with information and choices while guiding them through their experience within the web site. Repeat visits to Customer Service preferably gives a different CSR on a rotating basis.

Exemplary choices as shown in include accessing account information using a searchable FAQ of common questions review the Satisfaction Guarantee information and Contact Us or contact the marketing company . These choices will be discussed in more detail below.

 Contact Us preferably comprises of one or more e mail contact methods. Online e mail forms for sending questions or requests are provided where appropriate. The general Contact Us form handles all general customer service related and feedback questions in addition to requests for exchanges and refunds of products. In addition to e mail communications phone numbers and postal addresses for written communication are provided.

The satisfaction guarantees accessible by the view satisfaction guarantees link are also clearly stated at key decision making points in the ordering process such as viewing product information and at checkout. Procedures for returning a product for refund is posted in simple terms. In the United States a pre paid postage label is provided online for returning items.

The searchable Frequently Asked Questions FAQ area is also available for each section of the E Commerce site. The marketing company preferably provides the initial list of FAQs for each section and then maintains it once users pose questions.

A customer is also able to pose a product usage related problem or question and receive recommended products and instructions e.g. How do I get grass stains out of blue jeans . Product support spans both customer service and the shopping experience and is coordinated between the two functional areas.

The site can also include an online pop up tool tip help for various functional membership shopping and navigational items.

Content management and maintenance of the E Commerce site of the present invention allows suitably privileged users access to management functions on the product catalog and merchant information database on the server computer. Particular areas of the site are the responsibility of the content owners regarding ongoing maintenance. All site content is preferably copyrighted and owned by the marketing company. These areas are identified to assist with resource planning.

In terms of user access access to the content management and maintenance will be restricted. Employees of the marketing company are able to add delete and modify items in the product catalog database. The typical use of the item management tool is to modify item attributes such as long and short description and item images. The management system tracks basic audit information such as the time date and user who made the last change to an item. Exemplary attributes include but are not limited to the following 

Product information consists of complete and partial product descriptions product images in multiple sizes and translations 

Product selection determined by target group. Products are flagged according to membership type country of origin and language 

Content outside of product content such as order processing e mail correspondence to support multilingual requirements and

All e mail features and links to services such as News Sports Weather and Stock Information support multilingual and multinational requirements.

Online content for Sales and Marketing Plan and or any other business materials provided to shopper and

The management system also provides an interface to create modify and delete product categories as well as place items in a product class hierarchy. The management system also provides an interface to create modify and delete product item shipping information. This includes being able to create modify and delete shipping types and assign prices for shipping types for a given item. In addition for each item a default shipping method can be specified. This also includes specifying valid ship to regions for the specified items.

In this scenario there is preferably a management template and a display template associated with each page type. A content manager needs to open a browser system from his her workstation and go to a special internal web site that is used to manage content associated with the web site. The content manager logs on and selects an operation from a list of links to include check in box workflow and a link to administration for each section the content manager is allowed to work with. Users groups and permissions are set up and maintained in a manager . Administration for each content section entails adding a new content page using a simple data entry form or selecting an existing page from a list pulling up the data in that form and saving changes. The entire application is operating inside a navigation program such as Internet Explorer 4.x.

Behind the scenes the workflow application and the content administration pieces reside on a server computer. The application server component which displays the pages to the internet user pulls these records off of the same database that the server computer is managing.

This scenario applies to catalogs associated with one or more of the plurality of shopping page web files. The content management for the Shopping catalogs is one option in the administration list. To the content manager it does not look any different and it leverages the same workflow application. However the process to launch content is preferably different. Instead of using the database for the product information pages product information pages encompassing any content that is served in the Shopping application of the E Commerce web site the manager manages content up to the database insertion point the live content is stored in the Commerce product catalog shopping database. A customized workflow is necessary for any section of the E Commerce site that uses this hybrid content management content delivery system.

When the content manager selects to edit a content page in the catalog the application pulls the data for that record from the live database. The new or updated record in progress is stored in an edits database a separate database that could be a table on the logical database on the E Commerce SQL cluster until workflow is completed. Preview is enabled by bringing up the live ASP template and passing parameters these can include all information required to draw the page in ASP as well as a preview flag . The preview flag needs to be able to change the data connection so that the page is looking to the edits database. Upon launch the last step in workflow the customized workflow application in executes an update query on the live database or table and replaces the record.

There are several business reports made available to Members Plus and IBO s within the Virtual Office site as noted above. Exemplary reports include but are not limited to the following

Data may be stored according to the present invention in a variety of well known data sources which can reside in mainframe AS 400 UNIX and PC based systems such as host . The majority of the E Commerce transactions are preferably transactions running on a Legacy system. The backend data sources in host for example reside in the following exemplary formats IMS on the MVS hosts DB2 400 on the AS 400 hosts and Sybase on the UNIX systems. The following table Table 3 identifies an embodiment of intended locations of database information required to support an E Commerce environment of the present invention. It should be apparent to one of skill in the art that the following table is exemplary and does not limit the present invention to the particular objects set forth below.

Moreover data is stored in a variety of data sources that reside in for example Legacy UNIX and PC based systems. It is preferred that a majority of the E Commerce transactions be processed on either an IBM ES 9000 and or AS 400 Legacy system such as host . It should be apparent however that other suitable systems may also be employed.

To implement a system as embodied in the present invention it should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that an iterative testing and deployment plan could be useful. Exemplary testing procedures for implementing the present invention are discussed below. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art however that other suitable devices and or methods may be used.

The process of testing individual application components modules. This entails the individual programmer testing the component versus the specification given. This test ensures that the component operates within the specified parameters and is self contained insofar as tracing and error trapping.

This phase of testing is to test the interaction between the components specified in the design specification. All components acting independently should now operate smoothly within the integrated environment with respect to data integrity memory usage error handling and tracing.

The process of developing a reiterative process usually scripts that will test the base functionality of a site. This ensures that changes made during application development do not produce further errors throughout the system.

The process of testing a suite of application components modules which constitute the complete application. This is usually described as black box testing because Quality Assurance personnel are concerned with ensuring that the application behaves as it should i.e. the application functions according to end user requirements .

The process of verifying that different services will be delivered as expected under varying loads. Microsoft offers several in house developed tools free of charge for stress testing. One such tool the Microsoft Web Capacity Analysis Tool WCAT is well suited for testing E Commerce configurations. The tool is used to simulate a variety of workload scenarios on the network allowing a determination to be made regarding the best configuration for the server and network. WCAT is designed specifically for evaluating Internet servers running Microsoft Windows NT Server and Microsoft Internet Information Server IIS .

WCAT provides more than 40 ready to run workload simulations that enable the user to test the download of various sized pages or content from the server at different levels of connectivity. The tool is capable of testing Internet server performance using Active Server Pages ASP Internet Server Application Programming Interface ISAPI extensions and Common Gateway Interface CGI applications.

Performance Capacity test ensures that the system is capable of meeting its performance and capacity requirements. A performance capacity test specification outlines the tests to be performed sample data that needs to be created and any test software that needs to be developed.

The process of verifying that users can accomplish their tasks with the software as well as ensuring that software meets recognized standards. As an example the CSS Style Testing Tool StyleT performs a series of tests to ensure that the syntax of the Web content meets the Cascading Style Sheet CSS Specification.

The user organization tests the complete application against the requirements of functional acceptance black box testing . E Commerce brings together very complex business logic different membership types language requirements product types member profiles content creation and distribution methods as well as several layers of technology. Testing is forecasted to be one of the critical success factors and accordingly requires considerably more time to validate and implement the deliverables.
