The present disclosure relates to computer implemented methods software and systems for configuring and monitoring a single sign on system.

Users on the Internet may use multiple systems in their day to day activities. The multiple systems may be associated with different organizations and companies. In some cases users may use a single sign on SSO to access the multiple systems. To configure the multiple systems into a connected environment or landscape a central system administrator associated with configuring and connecting the multiple systems may need to communicate e.g. via email with each of the system administrators associated with the multiple systems to obtain necessary metadata. For example the metadata can include certificate information encryption information and other information needed for logging into the systems. If something goes wrong such as an expired certificate the central system administrator may need to send an email to the system administrator of the affected system and use information from the email in order to correct the problem.

The present disclosure relates to computer implemented methods software and systems for configuring and monitoring a landscape of systems connected using a centralized solution to provide a single sign on SSO for the systems connected in a cloud. One example process includes operations for identifying a first system for single sign on capabilities identifying a second system disparate from the first system for providing a single sign on capability with the first system through a cloud based SSO configuration manager automatically accessing metadata associated with the sign on information of the second system the set of metadata identifying sign on related information for sharing at least one credential certificate for logging in to the second system using the metadata to obtain an authorization for a single sign on between the first and second systems receiving a request from the first system for authorization at the second system and in response to the request providing the authorization and creating a cloud based SSO system that includes the first and second systems.

While generally described as computer implemented software embodied on tangible media that processes and transforms the respective data some or all of the aspects may be computer implemented methods or further included in respective systems or other devices for performing this described functionality. The details of these and other aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

The present disclosure relates to computer implemented methods software and systems for configuring and monitoring a landscape of systems connected using a centralized solution. The solution provides a consistent environment in the cloud to connect different systems across organizations locations and companies in single sign on SSO scenario.

For example the strong focus of the on demand business world and the growing number of cloud based applications offers many new business opportunities. A consistent SSO set up and support for cloud and or non cloud systems can provide a common set up environment that further supports an organized exchange of system meta data. This can eliminate the need by system administrators for carrying out individual and unsecure data exchange of security relevant meta data e.g. for signing and encryption certificates across disparate organizations and companies. For example a consistent SSO set up and support can replace mail based or other processes that are unsecure error prone and time consuming. Point to point agreements normally handled manually can be integrated with real time access of system meta data e.g. in a common set up environment that connects all involved system administrators of the different systems. Each system administrator can only access his own system s data. The problems of individual unsecure data exchange having mail based systems and other inherit problems can be solved by providing a cloud based application. For example the application can be a global system for SSO configuration set up and monitoring across systems of different organizations and companies e.g. a cloud based SSO configuration manager CSCM .

In general the cloud based SSO configuration manager is a system and or server that provides services for configuring and monitoring the landscape and that can be interfaced by the device to interact with the services. For example a user using the device can access information that is processed by the cloud based SSO configuration manager . In some implementations the cloud based SSO configuration manager may comprise a Web server one or more Web based applications accessed and executed by the device via the network . At a high level the cloud based SSO configuration manager comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive transmit process store or manage data and information associated with the environment .

As used in the present disclosure the term computer is intended to encompass any suitable processing device. For example although illustrates a single cloud based SSO configuration manager the environment can be implemented using two or more cloud based SSO configuration managers as well as computers other than servers including a server pool. Indeed the cloud based SSO configuration manager may be any computer or processing device such as for example a blade server general purpose personal computer PC Macintosh workstation UNIX based workstation or any other suitable device. In other words the present disclosure contemplates computers other than general purpose computers as well as computers without conventional operating systems. Further illustrated cloud based SSO configuration manager may be adapted to execute any operating system including Linux UNIX Windows Mac OS Java Android iOS or any other suitable operating system. According to one implementation the cloud based SSO configuration manager may also include or be communicably coupled with an e mail server a Web server a caching server a streaming data server and or other suitable server.

The cloud based SSO configuration manager also includes an interface a configuration engine and a memory . The interface is used by the cloud based SSO configuration manager for communicating with other systems in a distributed environment including within the environment connected to the network e.g. the device as well as the disparate systems . Generally the interface comprises logic encoded in software and or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate with the network . More specifically the interface may comprise software supporting one or more communication protocols associated with communications such that the network or interface s hardware is operable to communicate physical signals within and outside of the illustrated environment .

As illustrated in the cloud based SSO configuration manager includes a processor . Although illustrated as a single processor in two or more processors may be used according to particular needs desires or particular implementations of the environment . Each processor may be a central processing unit CPU a blade an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or another suitable component. Generally the processor executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of the cloud based SSO configuration manager . The processor executes the functionality required to receive and respond to requests from the device .

The cloud based SSO configuration manager includes a configuration engine which includes applications that provide business related functionality e.g. for users of devices as well as devices not shown associated with the disparate systems . Operations of the configuration engine are executed by the processor . The configuration engine generally provides for defining modifying and monitoring a configured landscape of disparate systems that are associated with a single sign on.

In some implementations the configuration engine includes a landscape definition engine a communication engine a testing engine and a monitoring engine . The landscape definition engine is a program application module or other software that logically connects disparate systems to the landscape e.g. specified by user inputs on the device .

The communication engine handles communication between the cloud based SSO configuration manager and disparate systems . For example the communication can include email or other messages asking administrators at the disparate systems to expose their metadata e.g. for the purposes of adding the disparate systems to the landscape or to confirm the validity of currently exposed metadata. Metadata can include and or be related to for example encryption certificates certification authentication signing certificates redirection universal resource locators URLs security assertion markup language SAML and others. The communication engine can also be used to identify and exchange transmit relevant metadata needed for configuring and communication among the disparate systems and the landscape.

The testing engine can test connections and or other aspects associated with the landscape and connected disparate systems . The tests can be based on received user inputs e.g. received from the device . For example the system administrator associated with the cloud based SSO configuration manager can use an interface on the device to initiate tests. Example tests include pinging a particular one of the disparate systems testing a login to one of the disparate systems and other suitable tests. Additionally the testing engine can be used to test landscape information and definitions stored in repository as described below.

The monitoring engine can monitor pre defined aspects of the landscape. For example the monitoring engine can determine when expiration dates of certificates are approaching e.g. to automatically generate a communication that can be sent by the communication engine to a system administrator of the corresponding disparate system . The monitoring engine may perform its operations on a constant basis a pre defined schedule or at specific intervals. In some instances for example the monitoring engine can monitor data within repository to identify potential issues throughout the landscape. In other instances the monitoring engine may be triggered manually to investigate certain landscape data and parameters in response to a request from one or more users or systems.

The cloud based SSO configuration manager also includes a memory or multiple memories . The memory may include any type of memory or database module and may take the form of volatile and or non volatile memory including without limitation magnetic media optical media random access memory RAM read only memory ROM removable media or any other suitable local or remote memory component. The memory may store various objects or data including caches classes frameworks applications backup data business objects jobs web pages web page templates database tables repositories storing business and or dynamic information and any other appropriate information including any parameters variables algorithms instructions rules constraints or references thereto associated with the purposes of the cloud based SSO configuration manager . Additionally the memory may include any other appropriate data such as VPN applications firmware logs and policies firewall policies a security or access log print or other reporting files as well as others.

As illustrated in the memory includes a repository that can include for example landscape definitions issues resolutions and other information. For example the repository can store information regarding the disparate systems that are connected in a single sign on landscape as well as information including information associated with the disparate systems exposed metadata for making the centralized SSO landscape possible. The repository can also store information about issues encountered and the corresponding steps that may be used to resolve them. For example resolution information for a failed test of a connection with a disparate system can include steps e.g. displayed on the device that the system administrator can take to correct the problem. Other components within the memory are possible.

The illustrated environment of also includes the device or multiple devices . The device may be any suitable computing device operable to connect to or communicate with at least the cloud based SSO configuration manager via the network using a wire line or wireless connection. In general the device comprises an electronic computer device operable to receive transmit process and store any appropriate data associated with the environment of .

The illustrated device further includes a client application browser . The client application browser is any appropriate type of application that allows the device to request and view content on the device . In some implementations the client application browser can be and or include a Web browser. In some implementations the client application browser can use parameters metadata and other information received at launch to access a particular set of data from the cloud based SSO configuration manager . Once a particular client application browser is launched a user may interactively process a task event or other information associated with the cloud based SSO configuration manager . Further although illustrated as a single client application browser the client application browser may be implemented as multiple client applications in the device .

The illustrated device further includes an interface a processor and a memory . The interface is used by the device for communicating with other systems in a distributed environment including within the environment connected to the network for example the cloud based SSO configuration manager as well as other systems communicably coupled to the network not illustrated . Generally the interface comprises logic encoded in software and or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate with the network . More specifically the interface may comprise software supporting one or more communication protocols associated with communications such that the network or interface s hardware is operable to communicate physical signals within and outside of the illustrated environment .

Regardless of the particular implementation software may include computer readable instructions firmware wired and or programmed hardware or any suitable combination thereof on a tangible medium transitory or non transitory as appropriate operable when executed to perform at least the processes and operations described herein. Indeed each software component may be fully or partially written or described in any appropriate computer language including C C Java Visual Basic assembler Perl any suitable version of 4GL as well as others. While portions of the software illustrated in are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects methods or other processes the software may instead include a number of sub modules third party services components libraries and such as appropriate. Conversely the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate.

As illustrated in the device includes the processor . Although illustrated as the single processor in two or more processors may be used according to particular needs desires or particular implementations of the environment . Each processor may be a central processing unit CPU an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or another suitable component. Generally the processor executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of the device . Specifically the processor executes the functionality required to send requests to the cloud based SSO configuration manager and to receive and process responses from the cloud based SSO configuration manager .

The illustrated device also includes a memory or multiple memories . The memory may include any memory or database module and may take the form of volatile or non volatile memory including without limitation magnetic media optical media random access memory RAM read only memory ROM removable media or any other suitable local or remote memory component. The memory may store various objects or data including caches classes frameworks applications backup data business objects jobs web pages web page templates database tables repositories storing business and or dynamic information and any other appropriate information including any parameters variables algorithms instructions rules constraints or references thereto associated with the purposes of the device . Additionally the memory may include any other appropriate data such as VPN applications firmware logs and policies firewall policies a security or access log print or other reporting files as well as others.

There may be any number of devices associated with or external to the environment . For example while the illustrated environment includes one device alternative implementations of the environment may include multiple devices communicably coupled to the cloud based SSO configuration manager and or the network or any other number suitable to the purposes of the environment . Additionally there may also be one or more additional devices external to the illustrated portion of environment that are capable of interacting with the environment via the network . Further the term client and user may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover while the device is described in terms of being used by a single user this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one computer or that one user may use multiple computers.

The illustrated device is intended to encompass any suitable computing device such as a smart phone tablet computing device PDA desktop computer laptop notebook computer wireless data port one or more processors within these devices or any other suitable processing device. For example the device may comprise a computer that includes an input device such as a keypad touch screen or other device that can accept user information and an output device that conveys information associated with the operation of the cloud based SSO configuration manager or the device itself including digital data visual information or a GUI as shown with respect to the device .

Further the illustrated device includes the GUI . The GUI interfaces with at least a portion of the environment for any suitable purpose including generating a visual representation of a Web browser. In particular the GUI may be used to view and navigate various Web pages located both internally and externally to the cloud based SSO configuration manager . The GUI further generates a visual representation of the client application browser that executes on the device . The GUI may be used for example in presenting the visualizations and information associated with the cloud based SSO configuration as provided in .

Generally the architecture can provide high availability and scalability and can be accessed via a common web browser or mobile application having REST and HTTP based protocols. For example the architecture can be accessed by system administrators associated with particular systems in the SSO environment as well as or including a system administrator who defines and maintains the landscape e.g. using a Web browser tablet application that executes on an SSO management console .

In some implementations the SSO management console system includes a load balancer at least one application server and a database server . The load balancer for example can handle incoming requests from various systems. For example the requests may originate from the Web browser tablet application executing on the SSO management console . Requests may also originate from user interface clients and or user interface applications that execute on the identity provider systems or service provider systems . In some implementations when handling a request the load balancer for example can re direct the request to the dispatcher of a particular application server that has performance and resources that best match the request.

In some implementations each application server can include plural components. A dispatcher for example can store a request received by the SSO management console system in a queue until the request can be handled by one of plural engines e.g. a service engine a presentation engine or some other suitable engine . The presentation engine for example can create information to be presented on user interfaces including the SSO management console . The information can include information used in configuring systems within the landscape information defining current connections within the landscape and information for testing connections with systems in the landscape. The service engine for example can operate in the background and can include a scheduler for scheduling services to be performed based on received requests a certification observer for certifying and reviewing the validity of certificates and an alert monitor for monitoring certificates.

The SSO management console system can also include an issue manager . For example landscapes configurations that are defined by a system administrator may have issues such as inconsistent metadata invalid HTTP endpoints corresponding systems that are not available expired certificates or required identity mappings that are not supported. These issues and other issues can be handled by the issue manager . In some implementations the issue manager can communicate with a repository manager that manages a repository e.g. stored in the database server . For example the information in the repository that is available to the repository manager can include a history of issues and incidents that apply to any current and former systems connected in the landscape. The issue manager can use the information for example to look up an issue in the repository in order to locate one or more possible solutions.

The repository can include information such as metadata and associated with particular IPSes and SPSes certificates business partners user interface models landscapes a service registry lifecycle management LM information incidents and test information . The repository stores data in a system specific way e.g. by company etc. so that critical data such as certificates is accessible only by a user system administrator or system authorized to access the information.

In one example scenario using components of the architecture ABC Company may want to use external booking service XYZ that is available for example as an on demand cloud service. The identity provider system in this example is associated with and located in the system landscape of the ABC Company and the service provider system is the external booking service XYZ. A system administrator of the ABC Company system can logon to the SSO management console system via the SSO management console and then describe and configure the system landscape. It may be the case that the needed SPS and IPS metadata and the users of the ABC Company are already defined to or loaded in the SSO management console system . If so the system administrator has only to configure the link to the external booking service XYZ. Then the SSO management console system can manage the further configuration of the single sign on certification and HTTP endpoint exchanges and the required user provisioning in the external booking service XYZ system. After the system administrator has activated this new SSO configuration the SSO management console system may observe for example expiration dates of certificates. This can automatically trigger alerts to be sent to the responsible system administrators to take action to update these certificates.

In some implementations the SSO management console system can be part of a particular company landscape. In some implementations the SSO management console system can be a centralized on demand service. For example while the SSO management console system is associated with ABC Company s system the SSO management console system can be made available as a cloud based solution such that all involved systems can easily and centrally access the configuration and other functionality. In some implementations the SSO management console system can be provided outside of the SSO participating systems.

The landscape can be presented for example in a user interface associated with managing the cloud based SSO configuration manager associated with the cloud based SSO system e.g. generated by the SSO management console system for display in the Web browser tablet application . The interface can include for example a graphical representation for the cloud based SSO system including the cloud based SSO configuration manager and the one or more systems in the cloud based SSO system. The interface can also include for example controls for selection of actions to be performed related to the cloud based SSO system and management of the cloud based SSO configuration manager.

In some implementations e.g. to design the landscape the user can select one of the available systems e.g. to drag and drop into a design area . For example before a landscape is defined design area may be empty. The user can use one or more of controls for example to select from existing profiles from which to design the landscape from a template. One example template can include a centralized identity provider service IPS e.g. IPS surrounded by plural service provider systems SPSes e.g. SPSes . At the time that the user selects a template or other profile to begin to design a landscape the specific names of the IPSes and SPSes may not be displayed as they have not been chosen yet but rather icons that represent IPSes and SPSes can be displayed e.g. in gray. As each of the available systems is dragged and dropped onto the template in the design area the names are filled in e.g. to match the names displayed in the available systems .

In some implementations solid connection lines with associated success icons e.g. shown here as checkmarks can indicate successful connection and communication among systems e.g. for SPSes connected to the centralized IPS . In some implementations dashed connection lines can represent connections that have issues and or problems related to for example communication errors invalid expired certificates or other reasons. For example a certificate error icon can indicate that there is a problem with a certificate needed for communication between the IPS and the SPS . In some implementations different symbols and or different colors can be used to provide a visual distinction between successful and unsuccessful connections e.g. using green for check marked success icons and red for the certificate error icon . Other visual cues and distinctions can be used. In some implementations dashed connection lines can be used to indicate connections that have yet to be fully made such as the dashed connection line that connects the centralized IPS with the SPS .

In some implementations boxes e.g. that are displayed next to icons representing the various systems can display high level information about a particular system. In some implementations a user can dive into and or display detailed information for a particular system by selecting one of the boxes e.g. by selecting a control in the corner of a box. In some implementations the detailed information can include information about the system s role its creation date internet Protocol IP address last load date of the metadata and other information. In some implementations the detailed information displayed for a system can include actionable options such as controls for pinging the system editing permissions setting SSO endpoints and other suitable actions and options.

In some implementations other actions can be performed by system administrators using the user interface or other user interfaces as in the following examples. A system administrator can set or access a security assertion markup language SAML uniform resource locator URL for a particular system in the cloud based SSO system. A system administrator can set or access a signing certificate from a particular system in the cloud based SSO system. A system administrator can set or access encryption certificate from a particular system in the cloud based SSO system. A system administrator can set a relying party e.g. a particular service provider system that relies on a particular identity provider system to execute user identification and authentication. A system administrator can set or access claiming rules the claiming rules defining attributes used for user authentication including a user identifier and email address. A system administrator can validate an SAML URL of a particular system in the cloud based SSO system. A system administrator can validate the signing certificate of a particular system in the cloud based SSO system. A system administrator can validate the encryption certificate of a particular system in the cloud based SSO system. A system administrator can access the exposed metadata associated with a particular system in the cloud based SSO system. Other suitable actions can be available in other implementations.

In one example sequence of actions that use capabilities of the run time view the user can select a login control associated with SPS e.g. to initiate a login test to SPS . As a result of selecting the login control a success status icon e.g. a green checkmark is displayed that is connected to IPS e.g. using a directional line to simulate a redirection to IPS . As part of the simulated login process a login popup can be displayed that contains fields and controls that allow the system administrator to enter a username and a password then select a sign in control to submit the login credentials. If the login credentials are received by IPS for example and if the login is successful then success status icons and can be displayed to indicate a successful test.

In some implementations a run time trace area can display a detailed log that includes detailed log information associated with and coincident to whatever test is being run e.g. the log in test . The run time trace is tailored to a particular SSO scenario and logs only relevant information related to a login and authentication procedure for the particular SSO scenario. The run time trace facilitates debugging and offers the user a more adequate tool than available generic HTTP monitoring tools such as HttpWatch http www.httpwatch.com .

At a first system is identified for single sign on capabilities. For example the IPS e.g. Company ABC can be identified as connected in a landscape that includes SPSes . The identification can occur for example when a user e.g. system administrator selects the IPS to drag and drop into the center of the landscape .

At a second system disparate from the first system is identified for providing a single sign on capability with the first system through a cloud based single sign on SSO configuration manager. As an example the system administrator can use the SSO management console to select the SPS e.g. XYZ Booking as a disparate system to be connected to the IPS e.g. Company ABC e.g. as a drag and drop action from the available systems .

At metadata associated with the sign on information of the second system is automatically accessed. The set of metadata identifies sign on related information for sharing at least one credential certificate for logging in to the second system. For example after the system administrator associated with the SPS e.g. XYZ Booking has exposed its metadata the SSO management console system can obtain the information from the repository specifically SPS metadata .

In some implementations the method can further provide information for presentation of a central system administrator interface associated with a cloud based single sign on configuration manager. For example some or all of the steps of method can occur while a system administrator e.g. associated with Company ABC is using the device interfaced with the cloud based SSO configuration manager to define a landscape of connected systems configured for SSO abilities. The system administrator can review the metadata associated with the second system without additional correspondence to system administrators of the second system e.g. XYZ Booking .

At the metadata is used to obtain an authorization for a single sign on between the first and second systems. For example referring to the metadata can be used to conduct an authorization between the IPS e.g. Company ABC and the SPS e.g. XYZ Booking .

At a request is received from the first system for authorization at the second system. As an example the SPS can receive the request from the IPS e.g. Company ABC as indicated by the that connects the SPS e.g. XYZ Booking and the IPS .

At in response to the request the authorization is provided and a cloud based SSO system is created that includes the first and second systems. For example the SPS e.g. XYZ Booking is now connected to the IPS e.g. Company ABC in the landscape as indicated by the success icon .

In some implementations the steps can be repeated to add additional systems to the landscape. For example adding a third system e.g. Example Car Rental to the cloud based SSO system can include identifying the third system disparate from the first and second systems. Then the cloud based SSO configuration manager can automatically access a set of metadata associated with the sign on information of the third system e.g. Example Car Rental from the SSO configuration manager. The set of metadata here identifies sign on related information for sharing at least one credential certificate for logging in to the third system e.g. Example Car Rental . The cloud based SSO configuration manager for example can use the metadata to obtain an authorization between the first second and third systems e.g. XYZ Booking Company ABC and Example Car Rental . The cloud based SSO configuration manager can then receive the request from the third system for authorization at the second system. In response to the request cloud based SSO configuration manager can provide the authorization and update the cloud based SSO system to include the first second and third systems. Alternatively the operations of can be performed to add one or more additional systems into an already existing cloud based SSO system.

In some implementations system administrators can test communications between particular ones of the systems and or the cloud based single sign on configuration manager. For example the system administrator associated with Company ABC can use the Web browser tablet application that executes on the SSO management console to test communications with XYZ Booking and Example Car Rental . In some implementations system administrators associated with the disparate systems can use similar interfaces to test communications between their systems and connected central systems.

In some implementations method can further include monitoring a set of certificates associated with at least one of the systems after creating the SSO system determining that at least one of the certificates associated with one of the systems is nearing expiration and alerting an administrator associated with the system of the nearing certificate expiration. For example the alert monitor e.g. with inputs from the certification observer can monitor certificates over time. If a certificate is about to expire the alert monitor can generate an alert that is receivable by one or more system administrators associated with central and or disparate systems. In some implementations other security mechanisms and or other system related aspects can be monitored in addition to the set of certificates.

At information is received about a test login by a system administrator associated with a particular system associated with the cloud based SSO system. For example the cloud based SSO configuration manager can receive information that the user has selected the login control associated with logging on to SPS

At operations from a particular service provider system associated with the particular system are redirected the redirection going to a particular identity provider system associated with the particular system. As an example the login is redirected to IPS as shown by the directional line in the simulation.

At a user authentication is received from the particular identify provider system. For example the IPS can access authentication information for the login in the repository .

At information about the user authentication is provided to the particular service provider system. As an example the IPS can provide the authentication for the login to the SPS

At information is subsequently received about a test login by the same system administrator at a different system associated with the cloud based SSO system. For example the cloud based SSO configuration manager can receive information that the user has selected the login control associated with SPS e.g. to initiate a log in to the SPS

At is it determined that the system administrator is already logged into the cloud based SSO system based on the login of the system administrator at the particular system associated with the cloud based SSO. For example cloud based SSO configuration manager can determine that the system administrator is already logged into the cloud based SSO system.

At user authentication information is automatically provided to a different service provider system associated with the different system to enable the login of the system administrator at the different system. For example cloud based SSO configuration manager can provide the success status icon e.g. as using an icon that represents a certificate error.

At the system administrator is notified of the results of the simulation. For example the results of the simulated test are indicated in the status icon the detailed popup and the run time trace .
