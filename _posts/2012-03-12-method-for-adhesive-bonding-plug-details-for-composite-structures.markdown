title: Method for adhesive bonding plug details for composite structures
abstract: An apparatus and method for repairing defects in composite materials using a tapered disk sized to fit the part being repaired. Also included is a bolt sized to fit through a central hole in the disk. A spring is positioned on the bolt with a washer. A nut is attached to the end of the bolt and tightened to place pressure on the washer to compress the biasing device. An adhesive is applied to the tapered disk prior to engaging the composite material. A threaded bushing is used to fixedly attach a second bolt completely in the hole.

This invention was made with government support under N00019 02 C 3003 awarded by the U.S. Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Organic matrix composite OMC structures and in particular high temperature OMCs are finding increased applications on products such as split fan bypass ducts. Repair of mis machined holes or small local surface damage can be expensive and complicated. A tapered composite plug is bonded inside the tapered hole that has been prepared in the duct with the use of a thermoset adhesive that requires heat and pressure for consolidation and cure. In some cases heat and pressure are applied through the construction of a vacuum bag around the repair followed by processing in a heated pressurized autoclave.

Current practices for adhesive bonding a plug into a large structure like a split fan duct are labor intensive and require expensive fixtures or equipment. A vacuum bag assembly could be constructed around the bond area and the part would be placed in an autoclave for the application of heat and pressure. This method requires an expensive piece of capital equipment and the use of vacuum bags particularly for high temperature polyimide materials are labor intensive and subject to leaking or bag failures.

Alternately a custom clamping mechanism could be developed in conjunction with a local heating device or the use of a large oven. This approach requires specially designed equipment and is cumbersome to apply on a large structure like a split fan duct.

It would be an advantage to provide a simple inexpensive and effective way to place a plug in a damaged composite product such as a split fan duct.

The present invention is a tapered plug used to repair small local damage or to repair mis located or mis machined holes in surfaces such as those made from composite materials. The tapered plug used for the duct repair has a hole through its center that is used in installing the plug in a composite material. This through hole can be used to assemble a bolt and spring assembly that applies load to the plug during the adhesive bonding process. This assembly provides a simple method for applying the required compressive load to the adhesive bond line during the adhesive bonding operation.

The local damage area is drilled or otherwise removed leaving a tapered hole into which the tapered plug will be attached. By compressing the spring to a given height predicated by the spring rate of the spring the necessary load can be applied to the adhesive joint. Heat to cure the adhesive can be applied by placing the part in an oven or by using a local heating source such as a heat blanket or heat lamp.

After the plug has bonded to the composite material the spring washer and nut is removed and a metal bushing with a threaded hole is attached to the adhesively bonded plug typically with rivets. A smaller bolt sized to fit in the bushing hole is then assembled to provide a flat repaired surface or for attaching hardware to the duct.

The present invention provides for placing a tapered plug that has a tapered periphery a bottom surface and a top surface . Plug also has a center hole as seen in . Normally the tapered hole will be about 1 inch to 1.5 inches 2.54 cm to 3.81 cm in diameter and will have a larger thickness than that of the composite repair section. Below plug is the surface to be repaired. Prior to repair the small local damage is removed such as by drilling to provide a tapered surface into which tapered side of plug engages. Either tapered surface or or both will have an adhesive thereon so that when the plug and bolt assembly of is established heat can be applied by placing the part in an oven or by using a local heat source such as a heat blanket or heat lamp. Plug is shown with tapered side having a larger diameter on top than on bottom side but a plug having the opposite sizes is equally effective and tapered surface of surface will also be matching side in either case.

Once plug has adhesively bonded to surface nut washer and spring are removed. Plug surfaces and protruding above the duct surfaces are machined as required to bring them flush with the duct and a metal bushing with a threaded hole is installed as shown in . Rivets and are typically used keep bushing firmly attached to the plug . Bolt is sized to fit inside hole not labeled on to attach an external component to the duct or to plug the hole.

While it is not totally essential it is normal for the plug to be made from the same material such as a composite as the surface being repaired. The plug and the piece need to be made from compatible materials. One composite that has been successfully repaired is a composite of carbon fabric which is T650 35 3k carbon fiber woven into an 8 harness satin fabric with a polyimide resin matrix such as AFR PE 4 resin. The present invention is useful for other materials such as those made from other carbon fibers and weaves fiberglass fibers alternate polyimide resin systems or different resin families such as epoxies and bimaleimides and the like.

While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment s it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment s disclosed but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.
