In some implementations storing configuration data in association with the unique identifier may include receiving user input describing operations needed to publish content updates received through the generated mobile authoring template to the web page. Based on the received user input a configuration file may be generated that defines all of the operations needed to publish content updates received through the generated mobile authoring template to the web page. The configuration file may be stored in electronic storage in association with the unique identifier. Accessing the configuration data based on the unique identifier may include searching configuration files for the configuration file associated with the unique identifier identifying the configuration file associated with the unique identifier based on the searching and retrieving from the electronic storage the configuration file associated with the unique identifier. Invoking content management services needed to publish the received content update to the web page may include invoking content management services defined within the retrieved configuration file. In some implementations the configuration file is highly secure and requires authentication authorization and audit rules for access to the configuration file. Secure access to the configuration file can be managed by an identity management system based on policies for accessing resources user information in terms of roles and groups and user s access rights to match the same. In some implementations each user is registered within the identity management system before downloading the authoring templates with relevant roles and access rights to access the resource.

In some implementations the system may include multiple different connectors that enable the system to connect with multiple different types of content management systems. Publishing content to the web page to reflect the received content update made on the mobile device using the generated mobile authoring template may include selecting from among the multiple different connectors a connector for a content management system that manages content included on the web page and using the selected connector to transfer the received content update to the content management system that manages content included on the web page. The system may be configured to add a new connector to support a new content delivery channel and publish content to the new content delivery channel using the new connector.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In some implementations a system for authoring and deploying content enables users to maintain and update web sites by using mobile device applications. In these implementations the content authoring and deploying system generates mobile authoring templates that include interface controls enabling users to make web page updates and stores configuration data related to the templates. The templates are provided to the mobile device applications. Users can interact with the applications using interfaces associated with the templates to update content. Content update information is received from the mobile device application. Based at least in part on the stored configuration data content management services are invoked to publish the received content update information to one or more web pages.

By interacting with a user interface provided by an application operating on the mobile computing device for example the user can access a mobile authoring template for updating a web page. In some implementations the user interface may provide multiple templates each template enabling the user to update a different web page or a different portion of a single web page. For example the user may select a desired template and interact with interface controls configured to enable the user to make updates to a web page associated with the selected template.

As part of a content submission process for example the user can interact with the user interface e.g. a content submission control to request that the application operating on the mobile computing device provide input defining web page content updates to a content management system . In some implementations input from mobile applications may be provided via a wireless Internet connection. In some implementations input from mobile applications may be provided from users in locations in which a broadband internet connection is unavailable. For example the input defining web page content updates provided by the application operating on the mobile computing device can be provided via communication over one or more networks including wireless cellular networks wireless local area networks WLAN WiFi networks Third Generation 3G or Fourth Generation 4G mobile telecommunication networks other communication networks or any appropriate combination thereof.

The content management system includes at least one processor and at least one memory coupled to the processor s that includes instructions which when executed by the processor s cause the processor s to perform various operations. For example the content management system can provide integration services with various service oriented architectures SOA associated with various content management systems CMS . Based at least in part on stored configuration data related to the template selected by the user for example the content management system invokes content management services to publish the received content update information to one or more web pages.

As part of a content publishing process various formats of content publishing can be used to format and publish content. For example JavaServer Pages JSP Active Server Pages ASP HyperText Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML and eXtensible HyperText Markup Language xHTML and other appropriate content publishing formats can be used to format the received content update information.

As part of a content deployment process formatted content can be provided to a web infrastructure . For example the web infrastructure e.g. the Internet and or an intranet can include one or more web servers application servers and file servers for providing web pages associated with one or more web sites. In the present example the web infrastructure can provide a final website with published content including a web page that includes the content update made on the mobile computing device by the user . Users can access the web page including the content update for example by operating client computing devices such as mobile and stationary computers executing web browser applications.

The system can include one or more mobile computing devices e.g. similar to the mobile computing device shown in operated by one or more users . The mobile computing device for example may be pre loaded with one or more mobile authoring templates and with an application that sends input defining content updates entered into the templates. The mobile authoring templates may be generated and provided to the mobile device application by an authoring template system .

The authoring template system includes a version management application and template management systems each including at least one processor and at least one memory coupled to the processor s . The version management application can handle authoring template acquisition by the user s for example by managing multiple template versions and by providing user s with appropriate versions.

The template systems can generate mobile authoring templates. For example a system user or administrator can identify a subset e.g. a region of text an image a data element a font a style etc. of a particular web page to be updated and the template systems can generate an authoring template including pre defined interface controls that are configured to enable users to make updates to the subset using mobile computing devices . The template systems for example can also associate a unique identifier with the generated authoring template. In some implementations associating the unique identifier with the generated mobile authoring template may include embedding the unique identifier in the authoring template. When content updates are received through mobile authoring templates for example embedded identifiers may enable template identification. The template systems can access file data servers for storing and referencing generated authoring templates for use in further processing. In some implementations generating mobile authoring templates may include generating multiple different mobile authoring templates that each include pre defined interface controls configured to enable users to make updates to subsets of web pages. For example the multiple different authoring templates can be generated for multiple different types of content management systems and can enable updates to multiple different web pages. Each of the multiple different mobile authoring templates can be associated with a unique identifier for example.

Configuration data can be stored in association with the unique identifier by a content management system including at least one processor and at least one memory coupled to the processor s . For example the configuration data may define operations needed to publish content updates received through mobile authoring templates to web pages. The content management system can perform various processes and services including one or more granular services a security service a content workflow process a content transformation service and a content syndication service . The content management system can access content management system servers for storing and referencing configuration data for use in further processing.

The content management system can interface with additional systems including a publishing inward system and a publishing outward system each including at least one processor and at least one memory coupled to the processor s . The publishing inward system for example may operate as a bridge between users and the content management system for publishing mobile content. As another example the publishing inward system may operate as a bridge between the authoring template system and the content management system for accessing mobile authoring template information. For example mobile authoring template information e.g. identifiers interface control information etc. may be provided to the content management system via the publishing inward system and or directly from the file data servers .

In some implementations storing configuration data may include receiving user input describing operations needed to publish content updates received through mobile authoring templates to web pages. For example a system user or administrator can provide instructions for publishing content updates received through a particular template to a particular web page. In this example a configuration wizard may guide the system user or administrator through the various pieces of information needed to publish content to the particular web page. As another example a system user or administrator can provide instructions for publishing content updates received through a particular set of templates to a particular set of web pages. For example the particular set of templates may be used for publishing content updates for web pages publishing using a particular content management system. Based on the received user input for example a configuration file may be generated that defines all of the operations needed to publish content updates received through the mobile authoring template to the web page s . The configuration file can be stored in association with the unique identifier for example by the content management system servers for use in further processing.

The generated mobile authoring template can be provided to a mobile application operating on a mobile device. For example the user can employ the mobile computing device to access a network e.g. the Internet or another appropriate network . To access the authoring template system for example the mobile application operating on the mobile computing device can navigate a security network including an external firewall an internal firewall and security web services which leverage an identity management system . For example the identity management system may verify the identity of the user based on identification credentials provided by the user e.g. a password credentials associated with the mobile computing device e.g. a media access control address credentials associated with the mobile application e.g. an application key or another appropriate mechanism. Upon verifying the user for example mobile application data can be provided to the authoring template system via an enterprise service bus . Based on provided identification credentials for example the version management application can determine one or more mobile authoring templates to be provided to the mobile computing device. The template systems can retrieve the appropriate template s from the file data servers for example and the authoring template system can provide the template s to the mobile computing device via the enterprise service bus .

The user can interact with a user interface presented by the mobile computing device for example to interact with one or more mobile authoring templates for updating web pages. For example the user can use a mobile device application executed by the computing device to select a mobile authoring template for updating a particular web page and to indicate one or more updates e.g. text updates image updates data updates font updates style updates etc. . The mobile application can provide update information to the publishing inward system for example via the network and the enterprise serial bus . The publishing inward system can reference mobile authoring template information via the template systems and or the file data servers for example and can provide template and or update information to the content management system .

The content management system can receive input defining a content update entered into the generated mobile authoring template using the mobile computing device . For example the input can include content update information and can include the unique identifier associated with the selected mobile authoring template. In some implementations receiving input from the mobile device application may include receiving a version of the generated mobile authoring template that includes a content update entered using the mobile device and that has the unique identifier embedded within the template. In some implementations receiving input from the mobile device application may include receiving input defining a content update made using one of multiple different mobile application templates selected by a user in accordance with which of the multiple different web pages the user desires to update. For example the user may manage multiple web pages such as a web page for presenting contact information a web page for presenting product photos and a web page for presenting sales statistics. In the present example the user may use the mobile device application executed by the mobile computing device to select a mobile authoring template associated with the web page for presenting sales statistics and may use the template to make updates e.g. changing sales statistics for a particular product to a subset of the webpage.

In some implementations in response to receiving the input defining the content update an identity of the user attempting to make the content update may be determined. For example the content management system can access the security service to determine the identity of the user and the security service can determine whether the user attempting to make the content update is authorized to make the update. If the security service determines that the user is authorized for example the content management system can process the update. If the security service determines that the user is not authorized for example the content management system can generate an error condition and prevent the update. Thus in some implementations multiple levels e.g. identity management content management of security may be used to maintain system security.

In some implementations in response to receiving the input defining the content update the update may be placed in a queue until content management services are available to process the update. For example the content management system can provide the content update received from the mobile device application operated by the user to the content workflow process which may maintain a queue of content updates received from various mobile device applications operated by various users. As resources become available for further content update processing for example the content workflow process can manage content updates from the queue.

In response to receiving input defining content updates configuration data can be accessed based on unique identifiers. For example the content management system can provide the unique identifier associated with the mobile application template employed by the user to the content management system servers to access configuration data associated with the template. In some implementations accessing configuration data based on the unique identifier may include extracting the unique identifier embedded in a received version of a generated mobile authoring template that includes a content update identifying configuration data for the extracted identifier and retrieving the identified configuration data. For example content management system can extract the unique identifier embedded in a mobile authoring template including one or more content updates received from the mobile device application operated by the user .

In some implementations accessing configuration data based on the unique identifier may include searching configuration files for the configuration file associated with the unique identifier. For example the content management system servers may store multiple configuration files each associated with a unique identifier. The content management system and or the content management system servers can identify the configuration file associated with the unique identifier based on the searching and can retrieve from electronic storage the configuration file associated with the unique identifier.

In some implementations accessing configuration data based on the unique identifier may include accessing configuration data for the unique identifier associated with the mobile authoring template selected by the user. For example the mobile device application operated by the user using the mobile computing device may include multiple different mobile authoring templates each associated with a unique identifier. In the present example the content management system can access configuration data associated with the template selected by the user .

Based on the configuration data content management services needed to publish the received content to the web page can be invoked. For example the content management system can access the granular services the security service the content transformation service the content syndication service and or the publishing outward system to invoke such services. In some implementations invoking content management services may include invoking content management services defined within a retrieved configuration file. For example the configuration file retrieved from the content management servers may include information associated with one or more services for publishing content such as formatting information application programming interface API calls validation rules business rules and the like.

In some implementations invoking content management services may include converting the content update into a proper format and structure for integration into the web page. For example the content management system can access the content transformation service to convert the content update to one or more appropriate formats e.g. JSP ASP HTML XML xHTML etc. for web page integration.

In some implementations invoking content management services may include validating that the content update includes appropriate information for the content update and transforming the content update into a form appropriate for incorporation into the web page. For example the content management system can reference and apply validation and or business rules included in the configuration file retrieved from the content management servers and the content transformation service can apply formatting information included in the file to transform the content update.

In some implementations invoking content management services may include invoking an authorization service to confirm authorization to publish the content update. For example the content management system can invoke the security service to verify that the user is authorized to update a web page e.g. the web page for presenting sales statistics using a mobile authoring template.

In some implementations invoking content management services may include invoking a syndication service. For example the content management system can invoke the content syndication service for presenting content in various formats for various purposes. For example the syndication service can provide the content update to various online platforms for presentation.

In some implementations invoking content management services may include determining whether a content management system supporting the web page requires synchronous or asynchronous transactions. For example the content management system can interact e.g. send and receive messages with other content management systems by invoking the granular services . Various other content management systems may be used to support web pages associated with content updates and may have varying protocols and application programming interfaces for handling the updates. For example in response to a determination that another content management system supporting the web page requires synchronous transactions content may be published using a synchronous transaction. As another example in response to a determination that another content management system supporting the web page requires asynchronous transactions content may be published using an asynchronous transaction.

In some implementations the system may be configured to add connectors to support content delivery channels and content may be published to content delivery channels using the connectors. For example content management system operations may be defined for multiple other content management systems and the granular services can be modified to connect to the other content management systems based at least in part on the defined operations. If a system user or administrator desires to connect with a new content management system a new connector to support a new content delivery channel can be added to the system for example by extending the granular services .

Content can be published to the web page to reflect the received content update made on the mobile device e.g. the mobile device using the generated mobile authoring template. For example the content management system can access the publishing outward system to publish content to one or more of the site servers . Users can access a dynamic content website including the web page for presenting the content update for example by operating client computing devices such as mobile and stationary computers executing web browser applications.

In some implementations the system includes multiple different connectors that enable the system to connect with multiple different types of content management systems. Publishing content to the web page to reflect the received content update made on the mobile computing device using the mobile authoring template may include selecting from among the multiple different connectors a connector for a content management system that manages content included on the web page. For example content included on a particular web page e.g. the web page for presenting sales statistics to be updated by the user may be managed by a particular content management system. The system for example can select a connector for the particular content management system e.g. by accessing a particular one of the granular services and can use the selected connector to transfer the received content update to the particular content management system that manages content included on the particular web page. The connectors may be reused by many users for many authoring templates.

In some implementations publishing content to the web page may include determining publishing activities needed to publish the transformed content update into the web page and publishing the transformed content update into the web page using the determined publishing activities. For example the publishing outward system can determine such publishing activities. In some implementations determining publishing activities may include determining from among multiple possible destination devices e.g. a database file server etc. a destination device for publishing the transformed content update into the web page. For example the publishing outward system can determine from multiple site servers one or more servers for publishing the content. Publishing the transformed content update into the web page may include for example publishing the transformed content to the determined destination device s e.g. one or more web site servers .

In some implementations publishing content to the web page may include integrating the received content update made on the mobile device e.g. the mobile device using the mobile authoring template into other enterprise content included in the web page. For example the web page for presenting sales statistics may include additional content such as graphics web links and descriptive text. Thus for example static and dynamic content may be included on the same web page and dynamic content may be updated by users through the use of mobile authoring templates.

Although the example shown in shows the authoring template system the content management system the publishing inward system and the publishing outward system as separate systems other examples may be used. For example one or more of the systems and or may be integrated.

In the present example a security administrator can create access rights policies. For example the security administrator can use an interface e.g. a web browser presented by a client computing device to access a policy manager server e.g. a web server to create access rights policies applicable to the user . The policy manager server may communicate with an access manager and a directory server for example providing access rights policy information determined by the security administrator to each. The access manager for example can store and manage security policy information e.g. granting and denying privileges and resource information e.g. role mapping for users. The directory server for example can store and manage information associated with access roles and groups for users.

Based on information stored and provided by the access manager for example various mobile authoring templates can be registered to apply policies. For example the access manger can receive mobile authoring template information from a mobile content authoring and deployment system including a content management system e.g. similar to the content management system shown in and a template system e.g. similar to the authoring template system also shown in . In some implementations mobile authoring template information may be retrieved via services. By registering the user with the access manager and or the directory server for example the user may access the system may receive mobile authoring templates from the system and may provide content updates to the system .

In the present example the user downloads one or more mobile authoring templates. For example the user may employ the mobile computing device to access a web gate e.g. a web server using one or more protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP and Short Message Service SMS and other appropriate protocols. One or more identification credentials e.g. passwords identifiers codes keys etc. may be provided by the user and or the mobile computing device to the web gate . In some implementations identification credentials may include one time security details. For example new users may provide such details to gain initial access to the system .

In the present example the web gate can provide identification credentials of the user to an access server and based on the provided details the user may be authenticated via the access manager and or the directory server . If the user is identified as a new user for example the access server may register the user with the directory server . If the user is as an existing user for example the directory server may authenticate the user .

In the present example role and group information can be associated with one or more mobile authoring template identifiers and can be provided to the access server for authorization. For example the access server can receive policy and resource information from the access manager and can determine whether the user is authorized to access the requested mobile authoring template s based on such information. In some implementations a token may be set at the web gate to facilitate future user access to the system .

If access to the requested mobile authoring template s is granted for the user for example the template s can be provided to the user. For example the access server can retrieve the template s from the mobile content authoring and deployment system via an access protocol and can provide the template s to the mobile computing device via the web gate .

The mobile application can communicate with the content management system via a service interface . For example the service interface can include a service oriented architecture for content management systems. The content management system can communicate with the web application using a content publishing interface . For example the content publishing interface can include multiple deployment scenarios including federated multi site deployments single site deployments and distributed deployments.

The mobile application can include multiple components including J2ME applications security components enterprise content management connectors content authoring templates static content preview components content presentation templates and UI tools. The content management system can include multiple components including mobile templates content storage components mobile publishing workflows website virtualization static content preview content presentation templates and UI tools. The web application can include multiple components including language interfaces e.g. Java Microsoft web presentation components e.g. mashups HTML IFrames etc. application servers web frameworks content management connectors deployment descriptors and model view controllers.

In some examples the data store may be a relational database that logically organizes data into a series of database tables. Each database table in the data store may arrange data in a series of columns where each column represents an attribute of the data stored in the database and rows where each row represents attribute values . In some implementations the data store may be an object oriented database that logically or physically organizes data into a series of objects. Each object may be associated with a series of attribute values. In some examples the data store may be a type of database management system that is not necessarily a relational or object oriented database. For example a series of XML Extensible Mark up Language files or documents may be used where each XML file or document includes attributes and attribute values. Data included in the data store may be identified by a unique identifier such that data related to a particular process may be retrieved from the data store .

The memory may store instructions and data corresponding to any or all of the components of the system . The memory may include read only memory random access memory or both.

The I O devices are configured to provide input to and output from the system . For example the I O devices may include a mouse a keyboard a stylus or any other device that allows the input of data. The I O devices may also include a display a printer or any other device that outputs data.

The system generates a mobile authoring template . For example the mobile authoring template may include pre defined interface controls that are configured to enable a user to make updates to a subset of a web page using a mobile device.

The system associates a unique identifier with the mobile authoring template . For example associating the unique identifier with the mobile authoring template may include embedding the unique identifier in the generated mobile authoring template.

The system provides the mobile authoring template to a mobile device application . For example the mobile authoring template may be sent to a mobile device application resident on a mobile device and the mobile device application may be executed by the mobile device to display and enable user interaction with the mobile authoring template.

The system stores configuration data in association with the unique identifier . For example the configuration data may be stored in a data store e.g. the data store described above with respect to . The configuration data for example may define operations needed to publish content updates received through the mobile authoring template to the web page.

The system receives input defining a content update entered into the mobile authoring template . For example the input defining the content update may be received from the mobile device application by an input module e.g. the input module described above with respect to . The input for example may include the unique identifier associated with the generated mobile authoring template. In some implementations the system may receive a version of the mobile authoring template that includes a content update entered using the mobile device and that has the unique identifier embedded within the template.

In response to receiving the input defining the content update the system accesses the configuration data based on the unique identifier . In some implementations accessing the configuration data may include extracting the unique identifier embedded in the received version of the generated mobile authoring template that includes the content update identifying configuration data for the extracted identifier and retrieving the identified configuration data.

Based on the configuration data the system invokes content management services needed to publish the received content update to a web page . For example invoking content management services may include converting the content update into a proper format and structure for integration into the web page. In some implementations invoking content management services may include validating that the content update includes appropriate information for the content update and transforming the content update into a form appropriate for incorporation into the webpage.

The system publishes content to the web page to reflect the received content update made using the mobile device . For example the generated mobile authoring template may be used in the publishing process. In some implementations publishing content to the web page to reflect the received content update made on the mobile device using the generated mobile authoring template may include determining publishing activities needed to publish a transformed content update into the web page and publishing the transformed content update into the web page using the determined publishing activities. For example determining publishing activities may include determining from multiple possible destination devices a destination device for publishing the transformed content update into the web page. The destination devices for example may include one or more databases and one or more file servers. Publishing the transformed content update into the web page using the determined publishing activities may include publishing the transformed content update to the determined destination device.

The user interface includes pre defined interface controls configured to enable a user to make content updates to a subset of a web page using the mobile device . For example the user may interact with pre defined interface control to update sales information for a particular pharmaceutical. Upon providing information for one or more drugs for example the user can interact with a selection control to indicate intent to provide the content update to a content management system such as the content management system also shown in .

Referring to for example the web page includes a subset . The subset in the present example includes a region of text associated with sales information for various pharmaceuticals. A mobile authoring template that includes pre defined interface controls that are configured to enable a user to make updates to the subset can be provided to the user s mobile device. The user can interact with the interface controls to indicate desired content updates such as modifying the sales information.

Referring to for example the web page includes the subset reflecting received content updates. For example a content management system such as the content management system shown in can publish received content updates to the web page. The received content updates can be integrated into other enterprise content included in the web page such as graphics web links and descriptive text.
