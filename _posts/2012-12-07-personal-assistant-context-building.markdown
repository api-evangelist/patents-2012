This is a U.S. National Stage Application filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application PCT US12 68404 entitled PERSONAL ASSISTANT CONTEXT BUILDING filed on Dec. 7 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Unless otherwise indicated herein the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

Computing devices particularly mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet devices are increasingly being equipped with automated personal assistant software. For example devices equipped with the iOS 5 operating system made by APPLE Corporation include an automated personal assistant named Siri . Devices equipped with versions of the Android operating system made by GOOGLE Corporation include an automated personal assistant referred to as Voice Actions or Google Now . Device users may also choose from a variety of third party personal assistant applications which applications may be supplied through digital marketplaces such as those provided by APPLE GOOGLE and AMAZON .

The function of personal assistants has been partially demonstrated however personal assistants may be improved to achieve greater utility convenience and power. By way of example there is an ongoing need in the industry to increase the power flexibility and convenience of personal assistants to better serve device users.

The present disclosure generally describes technologies including devices methods and computer readable media relating to personal assistant context building. Some example methods may comprise automated personal assistant methods performed by computing devices e.g. by mobile devices equipped with automated personal assistants. Example methods may include a data collection and database configuration stage and a user interaction stage. In the data collection and database configuration stage a computing device may detect a network service communication obtain parsed personal assistant data extracted from the network service communication and or store the parsed personal assistant data in a personal assistant context database. The computing device may adjust relative weights of relationships between the parsed personal assistant data stored in the personal assistant context database for example by strengthening weights of relationships between the parsed personal assistant data extracted from the network service communication.

In the user interaction stage the computing device may receive an automated personal assistant user input determine strong weighted relationships between the received user input and other personal assistant data in the personal assistant context database and configure a user interaction operation using personal assistant data having the strong weighted relationships.

Some example methods may comprise providing a parsing service. Example methods may be carried out by a network server. The network server may receive from a computing device a copy of a network service communication and parse data extracted from the network service communication to generate parsed personal assistant data. In parsing the network service communication the network server may for example maintain a network service library including service translation information for a plurality of network services identify service translation information in the network service library for the network service corresponding to the network service communication and convert data extracted from the network service communication using the identified service translation information. The network server may include the converted data in the parsed personal assistant data and send the parsed personal assistant data to the computing device.

Computing devices and computer readable media having instructions implementing the various technologies described herein are also disclosed. Example computer readable media may comprise non transitory computer readable storage media having computer executable instructions executable by a processor the instructions that when executed by the processor cause the processor to carry out any combination of the various methods provided herein. Example computing devices may comprise a processor a memory and an automated personal assistant configured to carry out the methods described herein. Example network servers may comprise a processor a memory and a parsing service configured to carry out the methods described herein.

The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects embodiments and features described above further aspects embodiments and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof. In the drawings similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description drawings and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure as generally described herein and illustrated in the Figures may be arranged substituted combined and designed in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.

The present disclosure is generally drawn inter alia to technologies including methods devices systems and or computer readable media deployed therein relating to personal assistant context building. In some examples network service communications such as network traffic resulting from the use of mobile applications or apps on a mobile device may be captured parsed and included in personal assistant context databases for use in configuring automated personal assistant user interaction operations. In some examples parsing services may be provided to parse forwarded network service communications and to generate converted data for inclusion in personal assistant context databases.

In some embodiments personal assistant context building may provide value to interpret the meaning of received user inputs such as voice commands by personal assistants. The terms user input and personal assistant user input are used interchangeably herein and refer to inputs to a personal assistant unless otherwise indicated. User inputs may take the form of spoken voice commands or inquires although other user input types such as text entries via a keyboard are also possible as will be appreciated. For example a mobile device user may ask a personal assistant Where is the starting line for the half marathon Absent context information it may be difficult or impossible for the personal assistant to provide a meaningful response to the user input. The personal assistant would not know which half marathon the user is interested in. As a result the personal assistant may throw an error or may require the user to answer additional questions to establish the missing information. The mobile device context is used in this example with the understanding that the technologies described herein may be adapted for any computing devices equipped with personal assistants.

At least partial context information may be gathered from network traffic involving apps installed on the mobile device. For example the user in the example above may have recently used an app provided by a race information service such as the Active.com app made by Active Network Inc. to look up the La Jolla half marathon on Apr. 28 2013. Information from network service communications by the Active.com app may be stored in the mobile device s personal assistant context database.

By including information from network service communications involving apps installed on the mobile device in the mobile device s personal assistant context database the personal assistant may have sufficient context to accurately configure satisfactory automated personal assistant user interaction operations responsive to received user inputs. The terms user interaction operation and personal assistant user interaction operation are used interchangeably herein and refer to outputs by a personal assistant or actions performed by a personal assistant which are perceptible to the user. User interaction operations may interact with the user for example by providing information to the user and or soliciting further input from the user. For example some user interaction operations may comprise audible speech outputs. Some user interaction operations may comprise questions asking the user for additional input. Some user interaction operations may comprise visual displays such as map interfaces photographs web pages or telephone keypad interfaces that may be preconfigured for dialing one or more contacts.

For example in response to the above example Where is the starting line for the half marathon user input a personal assistant may use context information from the Active.com app network service communications to determine that the user input likely refers to the La Jolla half marathon on Apr. 28 2013. The personal assistant may then for example determine the event location e.g. the starting line for the race of interest and the personal assistant may configure a user interaction operation comprising a display of an address or map interface or an audible speech output or response comprising the event location. Alternatively the personal assistant may configure a user interaction operation comprising a question such as Do you mean the location of the La Jolla half marathon on Apr. 28 2013 

Context information is not necessarily needed in connection with all personal assistant user inputs. Some user inputs such as a voice command call Bob may be unambiguous and may be executed by personal assistants without consulting a personal assistant context database. However context may be beneficial in connection with configuring user interaction operations responsive to many personal assistant user inputs. Configuring user interaction operations responsive to even seemingly unambiguous user inputs such as call Bob may in some cases benefit from consulting context information e.g. when there are multiple contacts named Bob among the mobile device user s contacts.

In some embodiments personal assistants may attain an increased level of situational and context awareness by observing network service communications such as Application Programming Interface API calls and responses. The network service communications may comprise network communications between apps and or web pages loaded on a mobile device and off device network nodes such as network servers hosting network APIs and or other network services with which the on device apps and or web pages may communicate. The network service communications may be interpreted and stored in a personal assistant context database optionally among other context information that may be gathered from other sources for inclusion in personal assistant context databases.

Embodiments of this disclosure need not rely upon active cooperation from apps installed on the mobile device such as apps that may be configured to cooperate by entering relevant data into a central repository e.g. central calendars or address books. Solutions presented herein may also provide more information than might be obtained through active cooperation by including information related to inconclusive user activities such as information identifying products events activities locations or other items that are investigated through an app or webpage and are therefore identified in API calls and responses or other network service communications but which products events activities locations or other items may not have been purchased registered flagged or otherwise subject to interactions that may trigger cooperative action by a cooperating app.

Large numbers of web based APIs are currently available and used by apps and mobile enabled web pages. By way of example travel APIs enable research and purchase of airfare hotel rooms and car rental. Social network APIs enable posting of photos status updates messaging establishing connections and the like. Location based APIs allow retrieval of maps restaurants bus stops real estate listings weather forecasts or any of a huge variety of other location based information. Email APIs enable reading composing and sending email. Calendar APIs enable making and checking calendar entries sending invitations to other participants and the like. Event APIs enable research and purchase of event tickets. Small businesses use web APIs to enable customers to schedule appointments. These APIs are the building blocks of the modern programmable web. One programmer web site provided by ProgrammableWeb.com recently listed information on 8045 different web accessible APIs. In many cases apps and mobile enabled web pages may comprise a front end for a cluster of web API calls and may perform API calls in connection with many of their operations. As a result network service communications such as API calls and responses present a potentially large source of information that may be useful for establishing personal assistant context information.

In some embodiments computing devices may be equipped with a packet sniffer that detects network service communications a parser to parse the network service communications and a classifier to classify the network service communications in a personal assistant context database. Technologies disclosed herein may use the packet sniffer parser and classifier in a data collection and database configuration stage to configure personal assistant context databases. Personal assistants may then make use of the personal assistant context databases in a user interaction stage wherein personal assistant context databases may be used to determine context for user interaction operations.

In some embodiments the packet sniffer may be configured in a network layer of a device operating system. The packet sniffer may be configured to detect network service communications e.g. by analyzing network traffic for API calls. API calls may be identified for example by detecting network traffic comprising http post and get calls with command and option fields by detecting network traffic comprising API key fields by detecting network traffic comprising API destinations by detecting format tags such as JSON or XML format tagging markers by detecting communications with known APIs by packet fingerprint or structural analysis and or using any other technique to detect network service communications. The packet sniffer may also be configured to detect responses from API calls e.g. responses in Extensible Markup Language XML or JavaScript Object Notation JSON format. The packet sniffer may alternatively or additionally be configured to detect any other types of network service communications whether API communications or otherwise. The packet sniffer may be configured to forward copies of detected network service communications to the parser.

In some embodiments parsers may be configured within computing devices e.g. as a component of a personal assistant on a mobile device. Parsers may be configured to parse copies of network service communications. Parsers may for example remove data from network service communications that is not relevant or cannot be used for personal assistant context building. Parsers may for example group data from network service communications into contextual groups for personal assistant context building. Parsers may for example convert data from network service communications into another form by inserting or modifying data in parsed personal assistant data to improve data utility as context building information. Parsers may be configured to store parsed personal assistant data in personal assistant context databases or to otherwise temporarily store parsed personal assistant data for further processing e.g. by classifiers as described herein wherein the further processing may eventually store parsed personal assistant data in personal assistant context databases.

In embodiments in which obtaining parsed personal assistant data comprises parsing network service communications by computing devices e.g. by a parser in a personal assistant on a mobile device as introduced above computing devices may be configured to convert parsed personal assistant data into another form e.g. into a form that is designed for use in the personal assistant context database. Example approaches may include identifying service translation information for a network API corresponding to the network service communication to be parsed converting data extracted from the network service communication using the identified service translation information to produce converted data and including the converted data in the parsed personal assistant data.

In some embodiments computing devices may be configured to maintain a network API library including service translation information for a plurality of network APIs for use in identifying service translation information for network APIs corresponding to particular network service communications. In some embodiments computing devices may be configured to connect to a network API library service to retrieve service translation information for network APIs corresponding to particular network service communications.

In some embodiments computing devices may be configured to access a parsing service via a network connection e.g. a parsing service configured as a cloud service. In such embodiments computing devices may be configured to obtain parsed personal assistant data by forwarding copies of network service communications to the remote parsing service and subsequently receiving parsed personal assistant data returned from remote parsing service. Remote parsing services may be configured for example to receive copies of network service communications such network service requests and or network service responses and to parse data extracted from the received network service communications to generate parsed personal assistant data. Parsing services may be configured to send parsed personal assistant data to computing devices for application in personal assistant context databases e.g. either by returning parsed personal assistant data to the device that originally forwarded a network service communication or by delivering parsed personal assistant data to a cloud based personal assistant context database.

In some embodiments parsing services may be configured to convert data into another form e.g. into a form that is designed for use in personal assistant context databases as described above. A parsing service may for example maintain a network service library including service translation information for a plurality of network services identify service translation information in the network service library for a network service corresponding to a particular network service communication convert data extracted from the network service communication using the identified service translation information to produce converted data and include the converted data in parsed personal assistant data that is returned to a mobile device.

In some embodiments classifiers may be configured to classify network service communications in personal assistant context databases e.g. by adjusting relative weights of relationships between among parsed personal assistant data stored in personal assistant context databases. The adjusting may comprise strengthening weights of relationships between among parsed personal assistant data extracted from a network service communication relative to other relationships between among personal assistant data in the personal assistant context database. For example if a network service communication included the terms La Jolla and half marathon a relationship weight between among these terms may be strengthened relative to relationship weights between among other terms that may not have been included in the network service communication.

In some embodiments classifiers may be configured within computing devices e.g. as a component of a personal assistant on a mobile device. In some embodiments remote parsing services such as those described above may include classifiers that perform at least some classification functions. Remote parsing service classifiers may be configured to classify data from network service communications received from mobile devices and to include classification information such as relative weights of relationships between the parsed personal assistant data or classification adjustment deltas in parsed personal assistant data that is returned to mobile devices. For example parsing services may be configured to determine relative weights of relationships between parsed personal assistant data to include the relative weights of relationships in the parsed personal assistant data and to send the parsed personal assistant data including relative weights of relationships to mobile devices for incorporation into personal assistant context databases. Parsing services may alternatively send the parsed personal assistant data including relative weights of relationships to a cloud based personal assistant context database. Mobile devices or cloud based personal assistant context databases may be configured to include received parsed and classified parsed personal assistant data in personal assistant context databases and optionally to adjust relationship weights according to classification adjustment deltas.

Personal assistants may make use of personal assistant context databases in a user interaction stage wherein personal assistant context databases may be used to determine context for user interaction operations. For example personal assistants may be configured to receive an automated personal assistant user input e.g. a voice input such as the example question Where is the starting line for the half marathon described above. Text or other inputs may also be received depending on personal assistant capabilities. Personal assistants may be configured to use context information to configure an automated personal assistant user interaction operation based on the received user input. For example personal assistants may be configured to use context information to determine which half marathon is intended by the user to configure an automated personal assistant user interaction operation in which a map interface to the event location is displayed.

Using context information to configure an automated personal assistant user interaction operation may comprise for example determining using a received user input and a personal assistant context database one or more strong weighted relationships between the received user input and other personal assistant data in the personal assistant context database and configuring an automated personal assistant user interaction operation using personal assistant data in the personal assistant context database having the one or more strong weighted relationships with the user input.

In some embodiments using a personal assistant context database may comprise interacting with a context database that is maintained locally at a computing device comprising the personal assistant. In some embodiments using a personal assistant context database may comprise interacting with a cloud based context database that is maintained by a personal assistant network service.

In some embodiments configuring the automated personal assistant user interaction operation may comprise configuring an internet search e.g. configuring a search for information on the event location for the La Jolla half marathon. In some embodiments configuring the automated personal assistant user interaction operation may comprise configuring a voice interaction with the mobile device user e.g. configuring a question such as Are you requesting the location of the La Jolla half marathon Of course user interaction operations may comprise a wide variety of actions such as placing a call sending a text message posting information to a social network displaying requested information retrieving driving directions or any of a wide variety of other possible user interaction operations. Any action performed by a personal assistant in response to a user input may be considered a personal assistant user interaction operation herein.

In browser app and widget are examples of applications that may execute on mobile device. illustrates network service communications and by app for simplicity of illustration however it will be appreciated that browser widget or any other application capable of sending and receiving network service communications may be subject to the context building technologies described herein. Nonetheless some embodiments may distinguish between different types of applications and may be applied to some types of applications or some application communications while excluding other types of applications or communications. For example in some embodiments the context building technologies disclosed herein may be directed to network service communications by apps such as app and not to network service communications by browser or widget . Embodiments may for example turn packet sniffer on or off based on which of applications or is controlling mobile device or may configure packet sniffer to detect network service communications having properties corresponding to apps such as app and not to detect network service communications having properties corresponding to browser or widget .

A network service communication is defined herein as a programmatic access to an automated network service the automated network service configured to provide an automatic response to such programmatic access or the automated network service response to such programmatic access. A network API implemented for example by a computing device within network is an example of an automated network service. A network API call is an example of a network service communication in the form of a network service request. A network API response is another example of a network service communication in the form of a network service response.

Information from an example API call made by an active.com widget and captured to serve herein as an example network service communication is provided below 

Information from an example communication session following the above initial API call made by an active.com widget and including various API calls and API responses captured to serve as further example network service communications is provided below 

Network service communications may be detected by packet sniffer . Packet sniffer may be configured within network layer of operating system as shown or packet sniffer may be configured at any other location within mobile device from which packet sniffer can analyze network traffic to detect network service communications.

In some embodiments packet sniffer may be configured to distinguish between network service communications and and other communication types such as voice communications transmitted when mobile device is used as a telephone. It will be appreciated that packet sniffer may use any of a variety of techniques to detect network service communications and . In some embodiments packet sniffer may analyze communications to detect whether communications include properties that are unique to or are typical of network service communications and . Communications having properties that are unique to or are typical of network service communications may be copied and forwarded to parser . For example in some embodiments packet sniffer may be configured to inspect network traffic for the presence of one or more of http post and or get calls with command and option fields API key fields API destination information XML formatted data and or JSON formatted data. Packet sniffer may be configured to treat communications having such properties as network service communications by forwarding copies such as copies and to parser .

Parser classifier and context database may be configured in personal assistant as illustrated in or elsewhere in mobile device e.g. in operating system . Parser and classifier may be configured with varying levels of power and corresponding complexity ranging from relatively simple embodiments to more powerful and complex embodiments. Parser and classifier may also be combined in some embodiments.

Parser may generally be configured to operate locally at mobile device and or to outsource some or all of its tasks to a parsing service that may be available via network . Local parser operations are described below. Embodiments configured to access parsing services are described in connection with devices implementing parsing services are described in connection with and methods for providing parsing services are described in connection with . In general parser may include similar features to parsing services described in connection with and and vice versa. Embodiments may deploy parser functions locally at mobile device or remotely in a parsing service according to design selections made for particular implementations.

Parser may be configured to modify network service communication data from a received copy such as copy or copy for storage in context database . Parser may be configured to remove aspects of network service communication data group aspects of network service communication data and or convert aspects of network service communication data as described herein. While parser is illustrated as a single component in it will be appreciated that parser may include multiple components. For example in some embodiments parser may comprise an XML parser a JSON parser and or parsers for other types of network service communications as appropriate.

In embodiments in which parser removes aspects of network service communication data parser may for example identify aspects of network service communication data that may include valuable content for context database and may remove other aspects of network service communication data. For example with regard to the below example section of a network service communication 

Parser may be configured to remove header information strings of unrecognized letters numbers and letters and certain XML data designated as typically of little context value to produce a parsed output such as the following 

Parsing techniques in particular implementations may retain or discard virtually any data from network service communications as will be appreciated. In some embodiments parser may be configured to identify and remove aspects of network service communication data that are unlikely to include valuable content for context database and to retain other aspects of network service communication data. Parser may be configured to store parsed data in context database and or to supply parsed data to classifier for further processing.

In embodiments in which parser groups aspects of network service communication data parser may for example identify repeating patterns of data and or different logical segments of network service communication data and parser may establish multiple groups of data to be stored in context database . For example with regard to the below example section of a network service communication 

Parser may be configured to identify repetition of multiple sections as well as to remove data as described above to produce a parsed output such as the following 

Parsing techniques in particular implementations may group data from network service communications according to virtually any grouping rules as will be appreciated. As noted above parser may be configured to store parsed data in context database and or to supply parsed data to classifier for further processing.

In embodiments in which parser converts aspects of network service communication data parser may be configured to use service translation information to convert data. For example parser may access a network service library that contains service translation information for multiple network services such as multiple network APIs to retrieve service translation for a network service network API identified in a received copy of a network service communication. For example the above example API call lists a host as api.amp.active.com . This or any other information as appropriate may be used to look up a network service such as a network API in a network service library. Service translation information may provide e.g. a list of typical terms used in connection with the network service and corresponding translation outputs and or handling instructions. For example service translation information for api.amp.active.com may provide 

Parser may be configured to use service translation information such as the above to convert data from a network service communication to produce converted data and to include the converted data in output parsed personal assistant data. For example parser may convert the data of GROUP 1 and GROUP 2 above using the above service translation information to generate converted data and to include the converted data in parsed personal assistant data to thereby produce the below parsed personal assistant data including converted data 

Parsing techniques in particular implementations may use service translation data that is configured according to any convention and may apply service translation data to convert data from network service communications according any of a wide variety of techniques as may be developed for particular implementations. As noted above parser may be configured to store parsed data including converted data in context database and or to supply parsed data to classifier for further processing.

Furthermore with regard to lookup of service translation data parsing techniques in particular implementations may look up service translation information in a network service library using any information or lookup techniques as will be appreciated. In some embodiments personal assistant may be configured to maintain a network service library including service translation information for multiple network services for use in identifying service translation information. Personal assistant may for example periodically download network service library information from a central repository made available via network . Parser may be configured to call the network service library maintained by personal assistant to retrieve service translation information. Alternatively parser may be configured to connect to a network service which may be available via network to retrieve service translation information for a network service corresponding to a received copy of a network service communication.

Classifier may be configured to classify parser outputs in context database . In some embodiments classifier may adjust relative weights of relationships between the parsed personal assistant data stored in the personal assistant context database. For example the weights of relationships between parsed personal assistant data extracted from network service communications may be relative to other relationships in context database . Classifier may for example classify parsed personal assistant data such as the following 

In some example embodiments classifier may classify the above parsed personal assistant data by increasing relationship weights between each of the terms regardless of group in the parsed personal assistant data by one 1 . In some embodiments classifier may furthermore increase relationship weights between terms within each group data by an additional one 1 . In some embodiments classifier may furthermore increase relationship weights between terms on each line of the above parsed personal assistant data by an additional one 1 . Thus for example a relationship weight between each of the terms race run and event and La Jolla Half Marathon may be increased by 1 because these terms are in the parsed personal assistant data. The relationship weights may be further increased by 1 because the terms are both in group 1. The relationship weights may be further increased by 1 because the terms are both in the first line of group 1. In such an example the total increase in relationship weight applied by classifier between each of the terms race run and event and La Jolla Half Marathon in context database may therefore be three 3. Meanwhile relationship weights between terms not included in the above parsed personal assistant data such as between the terms race run and event and some other term such as Washington D.C. or between Washington D.C. and some other term such as restaurant may remain unaffected. As a result weights of relationships between terms in parsed personal assistant data are increased relative to weights of relationships between other data in context database.

It will be appreciated that the above example classification is one of many approaches that may be applied to classify data. Any classification techniques that may be currently available or which may be developed in the future may be applied in particular implementations of this disclosure. In some embodiments classifier may be configured to adjust relationship weights in a time dependent manner e.g. based on age of data to allow decay of relationship weights over time. For example classifier may decrease relationship weights between the terms race run and event and La Jolla Half Marathon in context database in the absence of further adjustment of such weights or in the absence of modification or refresh of data in context database in response to the elapse of one or more predetermined periods of time.

In some embodiments classifier and context database or portions thereof and or portions of user interaction engine may be cloud based. For example personal assistant may be configured to access a personal assistant service via network to maintain context database and or to configure personal assistant user interactions.

It will be appreciated that the personal assistant context building technologies described herein may be implemented in any computing devices including but not limited to mobile devices. The mobile device context is used in and throughout this disclosure as an example however those of skill in the art will appreciate that the technologies described herein may be readily adapted for incorporation in other devices such as personal computers including desktops and laptops onboard vehicle computers or other computing devices equipped with personal assistants. Furthermore it will be appreciated that some embodiments may be distributed across multiple computing devices e.g. by collecting context information at one or more first devices and applying the context information in personal assistant context databases accessed from any of the first devices and or from one or more second devices.

Personal assistant may be configured to receive input also referred to herein as an automated personal assistant user input. Input may for example be forwarded to personal assistant by a mobile device operating system or user may activate personal assistant to give personal assistant control of mobile device along with any inputs received by mobile device prior to user supplying input to mobile device .

In some embodiments personal assistant may supply input to user interaction engine to configure an appropriate user interaction operation responsive to input . User interaction engine may configure and perform user interaction operation alongside any number of additional operations. For example in response to a voice command such as call Bob user interaction engine may look up Bob s number in an address book display a telephone interface with Bob s number play a voice output saying calling Bob and initiate a telephone call to Bob.

In response to a voice command such as Where is the starting line for the race user interaction engine may be configured to determine context information in connection with configuring user interaction operation . User interaction engine may determine using received user input and context database strong weighted relationships between received user input and other personal assistant data in the personal assistant context database . For example user interaction engine may determine a strong weighted relationship exists between race and La Jolla half marathon .

After context information is determined user interaction engine may be adapted to use determined context information to configure user interaction operation . For example in some embodiments user interaction engine may perform a retrieve interaction data operation such as an internet search for location starting line La Jolla half marathon . User interaction engine may configure user interaction operation for example as a search result display a map interface display or a voice output comprising information gathered in retrieve interaction data operation .

In another example user interaction engine may determine using received user input and context database strong weighted relationships between received user input and both of La Jolla half marathon and La Jolla Shores 5 k . User interaction engine may configure user interaction operation as a question to user such as Do you want the La Jolla half marathon or the La Jolla Shores 5 k It will be appreciated that many different types of user interaction operations may be configured any of which may usefully employ data from context database which data may be configured with network service communication information as described herein.

In parser may be configured to forward copies of network service communications such as copy to parsing service . Parsing service may comprise a network service available via a network such as network . Parsing service may perform some or all parsing operations such as those described herein in connection with parser to produce parsed personal assistant data . Parsing service may return parsed personal assistant data to parser . Parser may be configured to receive parsed personal assistant data . In response to receiving parsed personal assistant data parser may be configured to store parsed personal assistant data in context database and activate classifier for classification of parsed personal assistant data within context database or otherwise parser may be configured to provide parsed personal assistant data to classifier for further processing and storage in context database .

In some embodiments parser may be configured forward some but not all copies of network service communications to parsing service . Parser may for example select network service communications corresponding to select network APIs for forwarding to parsing service . Parser may send different types of network service communications to different parsing services or parser may handle some network service communications locally while forwarding others to parsing services.

In some embodiments operations described above in connection with parser forwarding copy and receiving parsed personal assistant data may be performed by personal assistant or an component thereof or by another process at mobile device as will be appreciated.

In some embodiments parser may be configured to perform some degree of pre processing of copy prior to sending copy to parsing service . For example parser may perform some of the parsing operations described above in connection with parser and then forward pre processed data to parsing service . In such embodiments copy sent to parsing service may be other than a true or exact copy of a network service communication as will be appreciated. Similarly parser may be configured to perform some degree of post processing on parsed personal assistant data received from parsing service .

In some embodiments parsing service may be configured to perform parsing as well as classification functions. For example parsing service may parse copy to produce parsed personal assistant data and parsing service may also classify parsed personal assistant data by assigning relationship weights to data included in parsed personal assistant data . Assigned relationship weights may for example be used by parser to adjust relationship weights of parsed personal assistant data when storing parsed personal assistant data in context database . In such embodiments classifier may be eliminated or may have reduced classification responsibility in connection with parsed personal assistant data .

Depending on the desired configuration processor may be of any type including but not limited to a microprocessor P a microcontroller C a digital signal processor DSP or any combination thereof. Processor may include one or more levels of caching such as a level one cache and a level two cache a processor core and registers . The processor core may include an arithmetic logic unit ALU a floating point unit FPU a digital signal processing core DSP Core or any combination thereof. A memory controller may also be used with the processor or in some implementations the memory controller may be an internal part of the processor .

Depending on the desired configuration the system memory may be of any type including but not limited to volatile memory such as RAM non volatile memory such as ROM flash memory etc. or any combination thereof.
