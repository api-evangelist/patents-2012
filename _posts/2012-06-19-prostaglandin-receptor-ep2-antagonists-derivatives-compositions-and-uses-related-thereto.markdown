This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 498 866 filed Jun. 20 2011 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grants 1U54 HG003918 and 1U01 NS058158 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Status epilepticus is a condition in which the brain is in a state of persistent seizure. There is evidence that 30 60 minutes of persistent seizure is sufficient to damage neurons and that such a seizure is unlikely to self terminate. Status epilepticus survivors may die soon after or have severe functional impairments accompanied by neuroinflammation. Longer seizure duration cerebral insult and refractory convulsive status epilepticus were strongly associated with poor outcomes suggesting a role for early neuroprotective strategies. See Legriel et al. Critical Care Medicine 2010 38 12 2295 2303. Thus there is a need to identify improved methods for treating or preventing patients recovering from prolonged seizures.

Cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 the inducible isoform of COX is rapidly upregulated in damaged tissue for example in the central nervous system CNS after a seizure or cerebral ischemia. In the CNS COX 2 induction overall contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration by producing prostaglandins. In the periphery COX 2 induction has both beneficial and harmful consequences. Pharmacological inhibition of COX can provide relief from the symptoms of inflammation and pain. Current non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs such as aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen exert their therapeutic effects via nonselectively inhibiting COX. However multiple downstream COX 2 signaling pathways that promote and oppose tissue injury are complex which suggests that modulation of a specific prostaglandin receptor could be a superior therapeutic strategy compared with blocking the entire COX 2 cascade.

Prostaglandin E PGE a dominant enzymatic product of COX 2 in CNS can activate four G protein coupled receptors GPCRs EP1 EP2 EP3 and EP4. When activated by PGE EP2 stimulates adenylate cyclase AC resulting in elevation of cytoplasmic cyclic AMP cAMP concentration which triggers multiple downstream events mediated by protein kinase A PKA and exchange protein activated by cAMP Epac .

In periphery PGE2 EP2 signaling plays a variety of roles. For example PGEis a major mediator of inflammation and pain. PGEis observed as one of the major prostanoid species in inflammatory lesions such as arthritic joints and shows pleiotropic proinflammatory actions in vitro. Direct delivery of PGEinto tissues can elicit inflammation and ablation of microsomal PGE synthase or EP2 showed reduced arthritic responses in collagen induced arthritis. Therefore the beneficial effect of NSAIDs could be at least partially if not fully caused by their inhibition of PGEproduction and the PGE2 EP2 signaling pathway might induce inflammation actions observed in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis RA . In addition PGE EP2 signaling regulates UV induced acute skin inflammation by increasing skin microenviromental blood flow and EP2 activation by oxidized 1 palmitoyl 2 arachidonoyl sn glycero 3 phosphorylcholine OxPAPC might contribute to vascular inflammation. PGEsignaling through EP2 EP4 exacerbates symptoms of inflammation by increasing IL 23 expression and reducing IL 12 IL 27 which together causes T cells to differentiate to Th17 effectors both in inflammatory bowel disease colitis and arthritis. PGE EP2 system up regulates a variety of inflammatory mediators including chemokines cytokines nitric oxide prostaglandins etc. to develop and maintain the inflammatory response.

In the brain based on the phenotype of EP2 knockout mice it appears that EP2 activation in microglia promotes inflammation and neurotoxicity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer s disease AD Parkinson s disease PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS . Genetic ablation of EP2 receptor reduced oxidative stress and improved cell survival accompanied by substantial down regulation of enzymes in glia that produce reactive oxygen species ROS such as inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS COX 2 and NAPDH oxidase. EP2 receptor activation by PGEupregulates iNOS NO expression in activated astrocytes by potentiating the response to inflammatory cytokines like TNF and IFN .

Because PGE2 EP2 signaling mediates both peripheral and neural inflammation pharmacological targeting this pathway can have beneficial implications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Thus there is a need to identify agents that can inhibit PGE EP2 signaling.

Status epilepticus refers to a potentially life threatening condition in which the brain is in a state of persistent seizure or recurrent seizure typically lasting longer than about 20 30 minutes. It is not intended that time of the seizure be of any specific duration but typically 30 60 minutes is sufficient to damage neurons and that seizures are unlikely to self terminate by that time. The mortality rate of status epilepticus is high especially if treatment is not initiated soon after. Examples of why one may experience such a seizure include because they have epilepsy and have stopped taking anticonvulsant medication a stroke hemorrhage or as a result of intoxicants adverse reactions to drugs consumption of alcoholic beverages fasting trauma to the brain brain disorders such as but not limited to meningitis encephalitis brain tumors abscess. It is contemplated that in certain embodiments the subject may be in a convulsive status epileptics for any of the reasons provided herein.

Status epilepticus may be treated with midazolam valproate phenobarbital thiopental pentobarbital diazepam or other benzodiazepines such as clonazepam or lorazepam. If these compounds are ineffective one may administer general anesthetics such as propofol or an NMDA antagonist such as ketamine. In certain embodiments the disclosure contemplates administering compounds disclosed herein after or in combination with being treated with anticonvulsive agents such as those describe above.

COX 2 and prostanoid products have a role in progression of tumors including lung head and neck prostate and colon ovary and breast hepatocellular carcinoma. Taking COX 2 inhibitor drugs regularly may reduce the rates of certain cancers and cancer related deaths. Upregulation of COX 2 in tumor tissues has been reported to be accompanied by high levels of PGE. Moreover EP2 activation by PGE can promote cancer cell growth and invasion by activating iNOS guanylate cyclase GC and mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK ERK1 2 via PKA mediated epidermal growth factor EGF receptor activation. PGE EP2 signaling in mammary epithelial cells triggers hyperplasia of mammary glands and EP2 receptor is an important element for PGE2 regulated vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF induction in mouse mammary tumor cells. EP2 signaling directly regulates tumor angiogenesis in endothelium by enhancing endothelial cell motility and cell survival mediates epidermal hypertrophy and tumor aggression in response to ultraviolet UV irradiation and induces skin carcinogenesis.

Thus within certain embodiments it is contemplated that compounds disclosed herein may be used for the treatment of cancers and tumors of the nervous system including those subjects diagnosed with cancer including skin blood vessel lung head and neck prostate and colon ovary and breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The compositions described herein can be formulation for modified or controlled release. Examples of controlled release dosage forms include extended release dosage forms delayed release dosage forms pulsatile release dosage forms and combinations thereof.

The extended release formulations are generally prepared as diffusion or osmotic systems for example as described in Remington The science and practice of pharmacy 20th ed. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 2000 . A diffusion system typically consists of two types of devices a reservoir and a matrix and is well known and described in the art. The matrix devices are generally prepared by compressing the drug with a slowly dissolving polymer carrier into a tablet form. The three major types of materials used in the preparation of matrix devices are insoluble plastics hydrophilic polymers and fatty compounds. Plastic matrices include but are not limited to methyl acrylate methyl methacrylate polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene. Hydrophilic polymers include but are not limited to cellulosic polymers such as methyl and ethyl cellulose hydroxyalkylcelluloses such as hydroxypropyl cellulose hydroxypropylmethylcellulose sodium carboxymethylcellulose and Carbopol 934 polyethylene oxides and mixtures thereof. Fatty compounds include but are not limited to various waxes such as carnauba wax and glyceryl tristearate and wax type substances including hydrogenated castor oil or hydrogenated vegetable oil or mixtures thereof.

In certain preferred embodiments the plastic material is a pharmaceutically acceptable acrylic polymer including but not limited to acrylic acid and methacrylic acid copolymers methyl methacrylate methyl methacrylate copolymers ethoxyethyl methacrylates cyanoethyl methacrylate aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer poly acrylic acid poly methacrylic acid methacrylic acid alkylamine copolymer poly methyl methacrylate poly methacrylic acid anhydride polymethacrylate polyacrylamide poly methacrylic acid anhydride and glycidyl methacrylate copolymers.

In certain preferred embodiments the acrylic polymer is comprised of one or more ammonio methacrylate copolymers. Ammonio methacrylate copolymers are well known in the art and are described in NF XVII as fully polymerized copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups.

In one preferred embodiment the acrylic polymer is an acrylic resin lacquer such as that which is commercially available from Rohm Pharma under the tradename Eudragit . In further preferred embodiments the acrylic polymer comprises a mixture of two acrylic resin lacquers commercially available from Rohm Pharma under the tradenames Eudragit RL30D and Eudragit RS30D respectively. Eudragit RL30D and Eudragit RS30D are copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups the molar ratio of ammonium groups to the remaining neutral meth acrylic esters being 1 20 in Eudragit RL30D and 1 40 in Eudragit RS30D. The mean molecular weight is about 150 000. Edragit S 100 and Eudragit L 100 are also preferred. The code designations RL high permeability and RS low permeability refer to the permeability properties of these agents. Eudragit RL RS mixtures are insoluble in water and in digestive fluids. However multiparticulate systems formed to include the same are swellable and permeable in aqueous solutions and digestive fluids.

The polymers described above such as Eudragit RL RS may be mixed together in any desired ratio in order to ultimately obtain a sustained release formulation having a desirable dissolution profile. Desirable sustained release multiparticulate systems may be obtained for instance from 100 Eudragit RL 50 Eudragit RL and 50 Eudragit RS and 10 Eudragit RL and 90 Eudragit RS. One skilled in the art will recognize that other acrylic polymers may also be used such as for example Eudragit L.

Alternatively extended release formulations can be prepared using osmotic systems or by applying a semi permeable coating to the dosage form. In the latter case the desired drug release profile can be achieved by combining low permeable and high permeable coating materials in suitable proportion.

The devices with different drug release mechanisms described above can be combined in a final dosage form comprising single or multiple units. Examples of multiple units include but are not limited to multilayer tablets and capsules containing tablets beads or granules. An immediate release portion can be added to the extended release system by means of either applying an immediate release layer on top of the extended release core using a coating or compression process or in a multiple unit system such as a capsule containing extended and immediate release beads.

Extended release tablets containing hydrophilic polymers are prepared by techniques commonly known in the art such as direct compression wet granulation or dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate polymers diluents binders and lubricants as well as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The usual diluents include inert powdered substances such as starches powdered cellulose especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose sugars such as fructose mannitol and sucrose grain flours and similar edible powders. Typical diluents include for example various types of starch lactose mannitol kaolin calcium phosphate or sulfate inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders include substances such as starch gelatin and sugars such as lactose fructose and glucose. Natural and synthetic gums including acacia alginates methylcellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone can also be used. Polyethylene glycol hydrophilic polymers ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders. A lubricant is necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery solids as talc magnesium and calcium stearate stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils.

Extended release tablets containing wax materials are generally prepared using methods known in the art such as a direct blend method a congealing method and an aqueous dispersion method. In the congealing method the drug is mixed with a wax material and either spray congealed or congealed and screened and processed.

Delayed release formulations are created by coating a solid dosage form with a polymer film which is insoluble in the acidic environment of the stomach and soluble in the neutral environment of the small intestine.

The delayed release dosage units can be prepared for example by coating a drug or a drug containing composition with a selected coating material. The drug containing composition may be e.g. a tablet for incorporation into a capsule a tablet for use as an inner core in a coated core dosage form or a plurality of drug containing beads particles or granules for incorporation into either a tablet or capsule. Preferred coating materials include bioerodible gradually hydrolyzable gradually water soluble and or enzymatically degradable polymers and may be conventional enteric polymers. Enteric polymers as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art become soluble in the higher pH environment of the lower gastrointestinal tract or slowly erode as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract while enzymatically degradable polymers are degraded by bacterial enzymes present in the lower gastrointestinal tract particularly in the colon. Suitable coating materials for effecting delayed release include but are not limited to cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose hydroxyethyl cellulose hydroxymethyl cellulose hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate methylcellulose ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate cellulose acetate phthalate cellulose acetate trimellitate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium acrylic acid polymers and copolymers preferably formed from acrylic acid methacrylic acid methyl acrylate ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate and or ethyl methacrylate and other methacrylic resins that are commercially available under the tradename Eudragit Rohm Pharma Westerstadt Germany including Eudragit L30D 55 and L100 55 soluble at pH 5.5 and above Eudragit L 100 soluble at pH 6.0 and above Eudragit S soluble at pH 7.0 and above as a result of a higher degree of esterification and Eudragits NE RL and RS water insoluble polymers having different degrees of permeability and expandability vinyl polymers and copolymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone vinyl acetate vinylacetate phthalate vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer enzymatically degradable polymers such as azo polymers pectin chitosan amylose and guar gum zein and shellac. Combinations of different coating materials may also be used. Multi layer coatings using different polymers may also be applied.

The preferred coating weights for particular coating materials may be readily determined by those skilled in the art by evaluating individual release profiles for tablets beads and granules prepared with different quantities of various coating materials. It is the combination of materials method and form of application that produce the desired release characteristics which one can determine only from the clinical studies.

The coating composition may include conventional additives such as plasticizers pigments colorants stabilizing agents glidants etc. A plasticizer is normally present to reduce the fragility of the coating and will generally represent about 10 wt. to 50 wt. relative to the dry weight of the polymer. Examples of typical plasticizers include polyethylene glycol propylene glycol triacetin dimethyl phthalate diethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate dibutyl sebacate triethyl citrate tributyl citrate triethyl acetyl citrate castor oil and acetylated monoglycerides. A stabilizing agent is preferably used to stabilize particles in the dispersion. Typical stabilizing agents are nonionic emulsifiers such as sorbitan esters polysorbates and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Glidants are recommended to reduce sticking effects during film formation and drying and will generally represent approximately 25 wt. to 100 wt. of the polymer weight in the coating solution. One effective glidant is talc. Other glidants such as magnesium stearate and glycerol monostearates may also be used. Pigments such as titanium dioxide may also be used. Small quantities of an anti foaming agent such as a silicone e.g. simethicone may also be added to the coating composition.

The formulation can provide pulsatile delivery of the one or more inhibitors. By pulsatile is meant that a plurality of drug doses are released at spaced apart intervals of time. Generally upon ingestion of the dosage form release of the initial dose is substantially immediate i.e. the first drug release pulse occurs within about one hour of ingestion. This initial pulse is followed by a first time interval lag time during which very little or no drug is released from the dosage form after which a second dose is then released. Similarly a second nearly drug release free interval between the second and third drug release pulses may be designed. The duration of the nearly drug release free time interval will vary depending upon the dosage form design e.g. a twice daily dosing profile a three times daily dosing profile etc. For dosage forms providing a twice daily dosage profile the nearly drug release free interval has a duration of approximately 3 hours to 14 hours between the first and second dose. For dosage forms providing a three times daily profile the nearly drug release free interval has a duration of approximately 2 hours to 8 hours between each of the three doses.

In one embodiment the pulsatile release profile is achieved with dosage forms that are closed and preferably sealed capsules housing at least two drug containing dosage units wherein each dosage unit within the capsule provides a different drug release profile. Control of the delayed release dosage unit s is accomplished by a controlled release polymer coating on the dosage unit or by incorporation of the active agent in a controlled release polymer matrix. Each dosage unit may comprise a compressed or molded tablet wherein each tablet within the capsule provides a different drug release profile. For dosage forms mimicking a twice a day dosing profile a first tablet releases drug substantially immediately following ingestion of the dosage form while a second tablet releases drug approximately 3 hours to less than 14 hours following ingestion of the dosage form. For dosage forms mimicking a three times daily dosing profile a first tablet releases drug substantially immediately following ingestion of the dosage form a second tablet releases drug approximately 3 hours to less than 10 hours following ingestion of the dosage form and the third tablet releases drug at least 5 hours to approximately 18 hours following ingestion of the dosage form. It is possible that the dosage form includes more than three tablets. While the dosage form will not generally include more than a third tablet dosage forms housing more than three tablets can be utilized.

Alternatively each dosage unit in the capsule may comprise a plurality of drug containing beads granules or particles. As is known in the art drug containing beads refer to beads made with drug and one or more excipients or polymers. Drug containing beads can be produced by applying drug to an inert support e.g. inert sugar beads coated with drug or by creating a core comprising both drug and one or more excipients. As is also known drug containing granules and particles comprise drug particles that may or may not include one or more additional excipients or polymers. In contrast to drug containing beads granules and particles do not contain an inert support. Granules generally comprise drug particles and require further processing. Generally particles are smaller than granules and are not further processed. Although beads granules and particles may be formulated to provide immediate release beads and granules are generally employed to provide delayed release.

In one embodiment the compound is formulated for topical administration. Suitable topical dosage forms include lotions creams ointments and gels. A gel is a semisolid system containing a dispersion of the active agent i.e. inhibitor in a liquid vehicle that is rendered semisolid by the action of a thickening agent or polymeric material dissolved or suspended in the liquid vehicle. The liquid may include a lipophilic component an aqueous component or both. Some emulsions may be gels or otherwise include a gel component. Some gels however are not emulsions because they do not contain a homogenized blend of immiscible components. Methods for preparing lotions creams ointments and gels are well known in the art.

Structure activity relationship SAR analysis based on modifying the structure of compounds A1 and A2 has been conducted to identify potent and selective probe candidates. The synthetic route to the analogs and the resyntheses of A1 TG4 155 and A2 TG4 166 are shown above. Typically an indole or substituted indole derivative was treated with 2 bromoacetonitrile in the presence of sodium hydride base. The resulting nitrile intermediates were reduced to amine using lithium aluminium hydride. These amines were coupled either to 3 aryl substituted acrylic acids in the presence of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochlroide EDCI dimethylaminopyridine DMAP in dichloromethane or coupled to 3 aryl substituted acrylyl chlorides in the presence of bases such triethylamine and potassium or sodium carbonates to furnish final products in good to excellent yields.

Information on the modality of antagonism can be obtained by performing Schild regression analysis characterized by log dr 1 log X log K. In the equation dose ratio dr fold shift in EC X antagonist K equilibrium dissociation constant for the antagonist receptor complex. A linear regression of log dr 1 on log Xwith a slope of unity characterizes a competitive antagonism and the Kvalue indicates the antagonist concentration required for 2 fold rightward shift in the dose response curve. Thus a lower Kvalue indicates a higher inhibitory potency.

To perform the Schild regression C6G EP2 cells were incubated first with vehicle 0.01 0.1 or 1 M of test compound for 5 minutes then with increasing concentrations of PGE to activate the EP2 receptor. Hit compounds A1 and A2 and analog compound 1v induced a concentration dependent rightward shift in the PGEdose response curve. The Schild regression analyses demonstrated that certain test compounds displayed a competitive antagonism in PGE induced EP2 activation with Ks 2.4 4.6 1.8 nM and slopes 1.0 1.1 1.2 for A1 A2 1v respectively. Analog compound 1v showed an improved potency in EP2 receptor inhibition and only 1.8 nM 1v is required to yield 2 fold rightward shift in the PGEdose response curve in C6G EP2 cells. The activity cytotoxicity and selectivity for EP2 antagonist are shown in the table below.

A lower Kvalue indicates a higher inhibitory activity of the compound. A fluorine attached to the methylindol ring 1f and 1g did not significantly affect the compound potency. If a methoxy was replaced by ethoxy 1p the inhibition was not significantly affected. However if the methoxy was replaced by an isobutyl 10 the inhibition was reduced compared to 1m. Interestingly if the methoxy was replaced by fluorine the potency from difluorophenyl 1r and 1s is higher than that from trifluorophenyl 1t and 1u . In addition replacement of methoxy by other halogens such as bromine in 1v or chlorine in 1w and 1x also increased the compound potency. Compounds with methylindol or fluoro methylindol ring ethyl linker acrylamide and methoxyphenyl or halogenphenyl displayed robust potency in EP2 inhibition.

Both DP1 and EP2 receptors are positively coupled through Gas to cAMP production and conduct very similar physiological and pathological events. Among the eight canonical prostanoid receptors DP1 has similarities to EP2 at both protein and DNA level. C6G cells that stably expressing human DP1 receptors were seeded into 384 well plates in 30 L complete medium 4 000 cells per well and grown overnight. The medium was thoroughly withdrawn and 10 L HBSS HyClone plus 20 M rolipram were added into the wells to block phosphodiesterase. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then treated with vehicle or test compound for 5 min before addition of increasing concentrations of DP1 selective agonist BW245C for 40 min. The cells were lysed in 10 L lysis buffer containing the FRET acceptor cAMP d2 and 1 min later another 10 L lysis buffer with anti cAMP Cryptate was added. After 60 90 min incubation at room temperature the TR FRET signal was detected by an Envision 2103 Multilabel Plate Reader PerkinElmer with a laser excitation at 337 nm and dual emissions at 665 nm and 590 nm for d2 and Cryptate respectively. The FRET signal is expressed as F665 F590 10.

PGE EP2 signaling has been recognized to play important roles in mediating tumor progression and tumor associated angiogenesis. Western blot analysis revealed that prostate cancer cell lines DU145 LNCap and PC3 express a low basal level of COX 2 but substantial amount of EP2. Compound A1 showed a competitive inhibition of butaprost induced EP2 receptor activation in a concentration dependent manner in PC3 cells. Butaprost induced EP2 activation promoted PC3 cell growth measured by MTT cell proliferation assay in concentration dependent manner with a maximal response being obtained at 1 M. Moreover the butaprost induced cell growth was attenuated by pretreatment with compound A1 also in a concentration dependent manner. In addition EP2 activation by 1 M butaprost in PC3 cells promoted cell invasion measured by counting cells that moved across a filter coated with Matrigel. Again cotreatment with compound A1 1 M also inhibited the EP2 activation induced cell invasion.

Excitotoxicity caused by NMDA receptor activation is recognized to induce neuronal apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo in cortical neurons. NMDA receptor activation can via COX 2 cause prostaglandin production including PGE. Activation of the EP2 receptor by PGEin microglia can promote neuroinflammation in several models of neurodegenerative diseases. The effect of EP2 antagonist compounds were examined on NMDA induced excitotoxicity. Rat primary hippocampal cultures DIV 13 15 were preincubated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of test compound for 15 20 min followed by treatment with NMDA 30 M plus glycine 10 M overnight in continued presence of the test compound. Lactate dehydrogenase LDH release was used as the measure of neuronal injury. NMDA treatment induced a significant increase of LDH release in the rat hippocampal cultures which was attenuated in a concentration dependent manner by preincubation with these EP2 antagonist compounds. The NMDA induced LDH release was reduced to 94.0 87.8 73.9 and 50.8 by 0.01 0.1 1 and 10 M compound A1 respectively.

In addition compounds A2 1f 1h 1v 1w and B1 were selected for this in vitro neuroprotection because of their low Ks high therapeutic and selectivity indexes or desirable pharmacokinetics PK profile. The NMDA induced LDH release was also reduced to 77.8 38.5 72.0 49.9 78.4 and 84.7 by compounds A2 1f 1h 1v 1w and B1 at 10 M respectively. Consistently the EP2 inactive analog 1e did not show any effect on NMDA induced LDH release. Interestingly compound A1 ECfor the reduction of NMDA induced LDH release was 0.80 M so about 450 fold rightward shift in the PGEconcentration response curve was required to yield half maximal neuroprotection by the EP2 inhibition.

Microglia are the initial and major mediators of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in various models of neurological disorders. EP2 receptor has been reported to regulate microglial activation and subsequent neurotoxicity in several animal models. The effects of EP2 activation in microglia were investigated. Rat microglia enriched cultures were incubated with vehicle butaprost or compound A 1 overnight. The cellular viability was evaluated by measuring Lactate dehydrogenase LDH release. Butaprost 10 M significantly increased LDH release to 138 in rat microglia enriched cultures. On the contrary EP2 antagonist compound A1 10 M had no significant effect on basal LDH release in rat microglia enriched cultures.

Nitric oxide NO synthesized by iNOS and prostaglandins produced by COX 2 are effectors of neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation thus these two inducible enzymes have been recognized as inflammatory mediators produced in activated microglia. As the dominant enzymatic product of COX 2 PGEtherefore might play a role in microglia mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. To investigate this possibility rat microgliaenriched cultures were preincubated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of compound A1 followed by treatment with 1 M butaprost. Gene expression of a number of inflammatory mediators and cytokines were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qRT PCR . EP2 activation by butaprost increased iNOS COX 2 IL 1 and IL 6 expression by 3.4 16.3 1.8 and 11.1 fold respectively without affecting expression of the EP2 receptor itself. The upregulation of these inflammatory genes by butaprost was inhibited by preincubation with EP2 antagonist compound A 1 in a concentration dependent manner. These data suggest that EP2 activation in microglia contributes to neuroinflammation possibly via upregulating inflammatory mediators including iNOS and COX 2.

Certain Compounds Reduce Weight Loss Prevent Blood Brain Barrier Destruction and Reduce Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration in Hippocampus after Status Epilepticus.

COX 2 induction in CNS overall contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration by producing prostaglandins. However the detailed downstream COX 2 signaling pathways involved in brain injury are not fully understood mainly because of the lack of selective small molecule modulators for some prostaglandin receptors. Three doses of compound 1h were administered 5 mg kg IP at 3 10 and 30 hours after 1 hour of pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. Status epilepticus caused a substantial weight loss of the animals which was reduced by compound 1h by day 4 P

Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are two prominent features following seizure promoted COX 2 induction. The mRNA levels of cytokines IL 1 IL 6 TNF and chemokines CCL2 CCL3 CCL4 CXCL10 in hippocampi from mice received vehicle or compound 1h four days after SE were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qRT PCR . All seven cytokines and chemokines were substantially induced by SE and administration of 1h largely blunted the induction by an average of 54 P
