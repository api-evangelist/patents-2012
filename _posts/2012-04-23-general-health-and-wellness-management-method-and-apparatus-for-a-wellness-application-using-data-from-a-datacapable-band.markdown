No. 13 158 372 filed Jun. 10 2011 ALL of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.

The present invention relates generally to electrical and electronic hardware computer software wired and wireless network communications and computing devices. More specifically general health and wellness management techniques and devices for use with a data capable personal worn or carried device are described.

With the advent of greater computing capabilities in smaller personal and or portable form factors and an increasing number of applications i.e. computer and Internet software or programs for different uses consumers i.e. users have access to large amounts of personal data. Information and data are often readily available but poorly captured using conventional data capture devices. Conventional devices typically lack capabilities that can capture analyze communicate or use data in a contextually meaningful comprehensive and efficient manner. Further conventional solutions are often limited to specific individual purposes or uses demanding that users invest in multiple devices in order to perform different activities e.g. a sports watch for tracking time and distance a GPS receiver for monitoring a hike or run a cyclometer for gathering cycling data and others . Although a wide range of data and information is available conventional devices and applications fail to provide effective solutions that comprehensively capture data for a given user across numerous disparate activities.

Some conventional solutions combine a small number of discrete functions. Functionality for data capture processing storage or communication in conventional devices such as a watch or timer with a heart rate monitor or global positioning system GPS receiver are available conventionally but are expensive to manufacture and purchase. Other conventional solutions for combining personal data capture facilities often present numerous design and manufacturing problems such as size restrictions specialized materials requirements lowered tolerances for defects such as pits or holes in coverings for water resistant or waterproof devices unreliability higher failure rates increased manufacturing time and expense. Subsequently conventional devices such as fitness watches heart rate monitors GPS enabled fitness monitors health monitors e.g. diabetic blood sugar testing units digital voice recorders pedometers altimeters and other conventional personal data capture devices are generally manufactured for conditions that occur in a single or small groupings of activities. Problematically though conventional devices do not provide effective solutions to users in terms of providing a comprehensive view of one s overall health or wellness as a result of a combined analysis of data gathered. This is a limiting aspect of the commercial attraction of the various types of conventional devices listed above.

Generally if the number of activities performed by conventional personal data capture devices increases there is a corresponding rise in design and manufacturing requirements that results in significant consumer expense which eventually becomes prohibitive to both investment and commercialization. Further conventional manufacturing techniques are often limited and ineffective at meeting increased requirements to protect sensitive hardware circuitry and other components that are susceptible to damage but which are required to perform various personal data capture activities. As a conventional example sensitive electronic components such as printed circuit board assemblies PCBA sensors and computer memory hereafter memory can be significantly damaged or destroyed during manufacturing processes where overmoldings or layering of protective material occurs using techniques such as injection molding cold molding and others. Damaged or destroyed items subsequently raises the cost of goods sold and can deter not only investment and commercialization but also innovation in data capture and analysis technologies which are highly compelling fields of opportunity.

Thus what is needed is a solution for data capture devices without the limitations of conventional techniques.

Various embodiments or examples may be implemented in numerous ways including as a system a process an apparatus a user interface or a series of program instructions on a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network where the program instructions are sent over optical electronic or wireless communication links. In general operations of disclosed processes may be performed in an arbitrary order unless otherwise provided in the claims.

A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the examples has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.

As described above bands may be implemented as wearable personal data or data capture devices e.g. data capable devices that are worn by a user around a wrist ankle arm ear or other appendage or attached to the body or affixed to clothing. One or more facilities sensing elements or sensors both active and passive may be implemented as part of bands in order to capture various types of data from different sources. Temperature environmental temporal motion electronic electrical chemical or other types of sensors including those described below in connection with may be used in order to gather varying amounts of data which may be configurable by a user locally e.g. using user interface facilities such as buttons switches motion activated detected command structures e.g. accelerometer gathered data from user initiated motion of bands and others or remotely e.g. entering rules or parameters in a website or graphical user interface GUI that may be used to modify control systems or signals in firmware circuitry hardware and software implemented i.e. installed on bands . Bands may also be implemented as data capable devices that are configured for data communication using various types of communications infrastructure and media as described in greater detail below. Bands may also be wearable personal non intrusive lightweight devices that are configured to gather large amounts of personally relevant data that can be used to improve user health fitness levels medical conditions athletic performance sleeping physiology and physiological conditions or used as a sensory based user interface UI to signal social related notifications specifying the state of the user through vibration heat lights or other sensory based notifications. For example a social related notification signal indicating a user is on line can be transmitted to a recipient who in turn receives the notification as for instance a vibration.

Using data gathered by bands applications may be used to perform various analyses and evaluations that can generate information as to a person s physical e.g. healthy sick weakened or other states or activity level emotional or mental state e.g. an elevated body temperature or heart rate may indicate stress a lowered heart rate and skin temperature or reduced movement e.g. excessive sleeping may indicate physiological depression caused by exertion or other factors chemical data gathered from evaluating outgassing from the skin s surface may be analyzed to determine whether a person s diet is balanced or if various nutrients are lacking salinity detectors may be evaluated to determine if high lower or proper blood sugar levels are present for diabetes management and others . Generally bands may be configured to gather from sensors locally and remotely.

As an example band may capture i.e. record store communicate i.e. send or receive process or the like data from various sources i.e. sensors that are organic i.e. installed integrated or otherwise implemented with band or distributed e.g. microphones on mobile computing device mobile communications device computer laptop distributed sensor global positioning system GPS satellites or others without limitation and exchange data with one or more of bands server mobile computing device mobile communications device computer laptop and distributed sensor . As shown here a local sensor may be one that is incorporated integrated or otherwise implemented with bands . A remote or distributed sensor e.g. mobile computing device mobile communications device computer laptop or generally distributed sensor may be sensors that can be accessed controlled or otherwise used by bands . For example band may be configured to control devices that are also controlled by a given user e.g. mobile computing device mobile communications device computer laptop and distributed sensor .

Examples of parameters include an amount e.g. expressed in international units IU of a nutrient such as a vitamin fiber mineral fat various types or a macro nutrient such as water carbohydrate and the like. Nutrition manager cooperates with conversion module to form a target nutrition score to which a user strives to attain. As such nutrition manager is configured to track a user s progress and to motivate the user to modify dietary related activities and consumption to attain an optimal nutrition profile. Nutrition manager therefore is configured to motivate a user to improve the user s health and wellness by improving the user s eating habits and nutrition. According to various one or more examples nutrition related parameters can be acquired or derived by any of the sensors or sensor functions described in for example . For example other parameters e.g. location related parameters identifying the user is at a restaurant or social related parameters describing proximity to others during meal times can be used to determine whether a user is engaged in a nutrition intake related activity as well the aspects thereof. In one example acquired parameters include detected audio converted to text that describes the types of food or drink being consumed. For example a user in the restaurant may verbally convey an order to a server such as I will take the cooked beef a crab appetizer and an ice tea. Logic can decode the audio to perform voice recognition. Location data received from a sensor can be used to confirm the audio is detected in the context of a restaurant whereby the logic determines that the utterances likely constitute an order of food. This logic can reside in nutrition manager which can be disposed in or distributed across any of a wearable computing device an application a mobile device a server in the cloud or any other structure.

General health wellness manager is configured to manage any aspect of a user s health or wellness in a manner similar to sleep manager activity manager and nutrition manager . For example general health wellness manager can be configured to manage electromagnetic radiation exposure e.g. in microsieverts such as radiation generated by a mobile phone or any other device such as an airport body scanner. Also general health wellness manager can be configured to manage amounts or doses of sunlight sufficient for vitamin D production while advising a user against an amount likely to cause damage to the skin. According to various embodiments general health wellness manager can be configured to perform or control any of the above described managers or any generic managers not shown configured to monitor detect or characterize among other things any one or more acquired parameters for determining a state or condition of any aspect of health and wellness that can be monitored for purposes of determining trend data and or progress of an aspect of health and wellness of a user against a target value or score. As the user demonstrates consistent improvement or deficiencies in meeting one or more scores representing one or more health and wellness scores the target value or score can be modified dynamically to motivate a user to continue toward a health and wellness goal which can be custom designed for a specific user. The dynamic modification of a target goal can also induce a user to overcome slow or deficient performance by recommending various activities or actions in which to engage to improve nutrition sleep movement cardio goals or any other health and wellness objective. Further a wearable device or any structure described herein can be configured to provide feedback related to the progress of attaining a goal as well as to induce the user to engage in or refrain from certain activities. The feedback can be graphical or haptic in nature but is not so limiting. Thus the feedback can be transmitted to the user in any medium to be perceived by the user by any of the senses of sight auditory touch etc.

Therefore that general health wellness manager is not limited to controlling or facilitating sleep activity and nutrition as aspects of health and wellness but can monitor track and generate recommendations for health and wellness based on other acquired parameters including those related to the environment such as location and social interactions including proximity to others e.g. other users wearing similar wearable computing devices and communications via phone text or emails that can be analyzed to determine whether a user is scheduling time with other persons for a specific activity e.g. playing ice hockey dining at a relative s house for the holidays or joining colleagues for happy hour . Furthermore general health wellness manager and or aggregator engine is not limited to the examples described herein to generate scores the relative weightings of activities or by the various instances by which scores can be calculated. The use of points and values as well as a use of a target score are just a few ways to implement the variety of techniques and or structures described herein. A target score can be a range of values or can be a function of any number of health and wellness representations. In some examples specific point values and ways of calculating scores are described herein for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be limiting.

Conversion module includes a score generator and an emphasis manager . Score generator is configured to generate a sub score score or target score based on sleep related parameters activity related parameters and nutrition related parameters or a combination thereof. Emphasis manger is configured emphasize one or more parameters of interest to draw a user s attention to addressing a health related goal. For example a nutrition parameter indicating an amount of sodium consumed by a user can be emphasized by weighting the amount of sodium such that it contributes at least initially to a relatively larger portion of a target score. As the user succeeds in attaining the goal of reducing sodium the amount of sodium and its contribution to the target score can be deemphasized.

Status manager includes a haptic engine and a display engine . Haptic engine can be configured to impart vibratory energy for example from a wearable device to a user s body as a notification reminder or alert relating to the progress or fulfillment of user s sleep activity nutrition or other health and wellness goals relative to target scores. Display engine can be configured to generate a graphical representation on an interface such as a touch sensitive screen on a mobile phone . In various embodiments elements of aggregation engine and elements of status manager can be disposed in either wearable device or mobile phone or can be distributed among device phone or any other device not shown. Elements of aggregation engine and elements of status manager can be implemented in either hardware or software or a combination thereof.

Generic manager s represents any number of hardware and or software implementations configured to manage the acquisition of acquired parameters for monitoring any aspect of health and wellness for purposes of for example tracking a user s progress and improvements toward a goal for an aspect of health and wellness e.g. limiting amounts of sun light limiting consumption of fish with known levels of mercury limiting exposure to electromagnetic radiation and any other state or conditions that affect one s health . Further generic manager s facilitate score calculations relating to any specific aspect of health and wellness and can provide recommendations for improving such scores.

Environmental manager is configured to receive data representing parameters relating to an environment in which a user or other persons of interest is disposed and configured to maintain data representing one or more environmental profiles. Environment related parameters describe characteristics factors or attributes of for example an environment and can be formed from sensor data or derived based on computations. In some examples environment related parameters can be acquired or derived by any of the sensors or sensor functions described in for example . Examples of environmentally related parameters include a location e.g. absolute in terms of geometric coordinates via GPS or approximate coordinates based on triangulation of radio signals etc. and perceptible aspects of an environment such as audio aspects e.g. spoken words detectable to determine certain activities related to nutrition intake exercise etc. or visual aspects. Examples of environmentally related parameters also include data representing vibrations or motion that a wearable device is experiencing e.g. the user is traveling in a car locations of identified friends or users of other wearable computing devices in communication with each other locations of destinations or originations locations of places to avoid e.g. a food court in a mall or to migrate toward e.g. another user that is participating in a similar activity numbers of people on a jogging route e.g. to ensure an optimal running route atmospheric pressures whether the wearable device is submerged in water and any other parameter that defines or describes an environment of interest. Other environmentally related parameters include data representing health and wellness characteristics of a location e.g. general health or characteristics of people visiting a location such as a stadium restaurant or a home or of a region e.g. general health or characteristics of people living in a region such as rates of alcoholism obesity etc. of a city county or state . Such data can be used to influence score calculations and or recommendations. The above described examples are not intended to be limiting. Environmental manager is configured to also generate trend data relating to locations and other activities a user is engaged to predict a future activity e.g. a dance class that is possible based on past visits to a location e.g. a gym .

Social manager is configured to receive data representing parameters relating to social interactions and proximities to others relative to a user or other persons of interest . In some examples social related parameters can be acquired or derived by any of the sensors or sensor functions described in for example including mobile phones and computing devices. Social related parameters describe characteristics factors or attributes of for example a social network of a user and can be formed from sensor data or derived based on computations. Examples of social related parameters include data representing family and friends and optionally aspects of their health and wellness and data representing other users of wearable devices and optionally aspects of their health and wellness too. For example friends and can be identified from their health and wellness profiles overall scores or targets scores to be active friends. Examples of other social related parameters include data representing proximities to other wearable devices and information describing interactions or future interactions with others. For example social related parameters can include data derived from phone calls e.g. decoded audio and speech into text caller ID information date time etc. emails texts and other communications in which a user is arranging an activity with other persons. Social related parameters can also include data from or exchanged with various networking web sites in which users exchange information between one or more levels of permissions e.g. usually based on friendships or as acquaintances . General health wellness manager can use this information to generate recommendations on whether to associate with active persons rather than inactive persons and to predict types of activities a user is engaged in base on at least in part the information derived from communications and interactions with others. Also social manager is configured to generate recommendations to induce users to socialize with others with similar goals or to reinforce favorable habits e.g. telling a person next to the user a good reasons to drink water . The above described examples are not intended to be limiting.

Conversion module includes a score generator and an emphasis generator according to some examples. The functionality and or structure can be equivalent to similarly named elements described herein. Score generator can include an activity sleep nutrition A S N score generator configured to calculate one or more scores based on activity sleep nutrition intake or any other aspect of health and wellness for a user and a context score generator configured to calculate one or more scores based on the environment and or social interactions or proximities between a user and other people. In some examples context score generator generates a context score that indicates a context in which a user is disposed or in which a user is performing an activity. The context score can be used to influence a score to provide motivation and inducements to a user to meet one or more health and wellness objectives responsive to environmental and social factors.

Diagram also shows social manager and an environmental manager configured to exchange data with context score generator . For example social manager and environmental manager can transmit to context score generator values of acquired environmental parameters and values of acquired social parameters . Social manager and or environmental manager as well as general health wellness manager can be configured to facilitate social networks and the functionalities and or structures are described in .

Context score generator generates a context score that is indicative of the degree of impact caused by either an aspect of the environment or social interactions or both in relation to user . For example a context score can be negatively impacted if user lives or spends time in regions of high rates of obesity or with a group of people that tend to be sedentary or at bars and nightclubs. However the context score can be positively influenced by spending time at or near areas of relatively high occurrences of physical activities e.g. spending time on a basketball court or having a network of active friends. The context score is provided to general health and wellness manager to optionally influence an overall score e.g. including sleep nutrition and activity scores relative to a target score. Responsive to a context score general health and wellness manager can generate recommendations. For example general health and wellness manager can determine that a user is at a specific location and can recommend one or more activities associated with that location or a structure at that location. If user is at a stadium general health and wellness manager can generate recommendations to climb a number of stairs associated with the stadium structure or can suggest a glass of water rather than a beer with a hot dog. If user is at a shopping mall mobile devices and or wearable device can project a path that passes a food court and recommend altering course onto another path to avoid the food court or to connect socially with another user sharing for example similar health and wellness profiles i.e. goals . Therefore general health and wellness manager can generate recommendations based on acquired parameters received by any sleep manager activity manager nutrition manager environmental manager social manager or any number of generic managers to determine an overall score relative to an overall target score and can propose actions that affect one aspect of health and wellness e.g. sleeping based on one or more other aspects of health and wellness e.g. environment nutrition etc. .

In some embodiments wearable device can generate messages encoded in vibratory messaging. For example two long vibratory pulses can indicate that user ought to turn right and three short vibratory pulses can indicate that a user turn left. This vibratory messaging scheme can assist navigation of user to avoid detrimental locations such as a food court or can assist user to select a less populous running route based on data originating from a server that describes a number of pedestrians and cyclists based on locations of other wearable devices or cell phone locations e.g. base on triangulation GPS or other means . The vibratory energy can increase as the user comes closer to a point at which to turn and decreases once the user passes that point.

Data interface is configured to receive data representing parameters such as physical parameters environmental parameters and nutrition parameters . Such parameters can originate at any type of sensor such as those described herein or can be derived e.g. computationally or can be input as data extracted for example from a networked database. Examples of physical parameters include a sleep start time a sleep end time a duration of light sleep and or a total duration of light sleep between the start and sleep end times a duration of deep sleep and or a total duration of deep sleep between the start and sleep end times a heart rate a body temperature and the like. Examples of environmental parameters include an amount of light a level of sound energy an ambient temperature a location of a user a location of another user and the like. Environmental parameters as well as any other parameter can be archived in archived data files so that trends can be established to determine for example the locations at which a user tends to participate in positive activities i.e. in terms of achieving a target score . This information can be used to generate recommendations to induce a user toward achieving a target score. Parameters also can include nutrient related parameters that causes physiological manifestations in for example types of gases such as CO2 expelled from the lungs or skin as well as steps minutes of activity motion minutes of inactivity no motion intensity of activity aerobic minutes aerobic intensity calories burned training sessions length of training sessions intensity of training sessions calories burned during training session s type of activities duration of each type of activity intensity of each type of activity calories burned during each type of activity instantaneous body temperature average body temperature instantaneous skin galvanization average skin galvanization instantaneous heart rate average heart rate instantaneous perspiration average perspiration instantaneous blood sugar level average blood sugar level instantaneous respiration rate average respiration rate and the like.

Examples of nutrition parameters include types of consumable materials and their nutrient compositions for specific unit amounts or volume. As used herein the term consumable material refers to any material consumed as either food or drink and has at least one or more nutrients from which to provide a user. A consumable material can be medicine or any other substance that enters the body e.g. orally or by any other means such as through the skin or is inhaled . A consumable material component is a component of a meal such as a side salad French fries or a main entr e that when combined with other meal components form a meal. Each of the consumable material components can have equivalent nutrients such as sodium that can be isolated measured monitored and reported as an aggregate amount of the specific nutrient for the meal i.e. over all the parts of the meal containing that nutrient . In some embodiments nutrition parameters can be stored as nutrition parameter data . Types of consumable materials include unprocessed foods and drink such as fruits vegetables unprocessed meats water etc. and processed foods and drink such as restaurant meals processed and packaged foods etc. Nutrition parameters can include descriptors specifying amounts of the nutrients such as units e.g. real numbers representing units of measure such as IUs mg g ml cups etc. and types of nutrients. Types of nutrients can include carbohydrates of a various subtypes including fiber fats minerals proteins vitamins water and any combination or variation thereof. Data representing nutrition parameters can be acquired e.g. as acquired parameters by way of input by a user. A social parameter includes data representing a social interaction between a user and another person via any form of communication such as face to face phone email text amounts of time spent with a person and the like. Social parameters can be archived in archived data files so that trends can be established to determine for example the people with which a user tends to participate in positive activities i.e. in terms of achieving a target score . This information can be used to generate recommendations to induce a user toward achieving a target score. Any other characteristics of social interactions including proximity to other persons or the proximities of wearable devices relative to each other and data derived from social networking web sites and other databases are also included in social parameters . As used herein the term acquired parameter refers to one or more parameters that are obtained for purposes of analyzing nutritional intake e.g. nutrition parameters describing nutrition of food or drink that is consumed or to be consumed . Data representing an acquired parameter can include an amount e.g. units of a nutrient and a type of the nutrient. In some embodiments an acquired parameter is associated with data originating from a wearable computing device. In some embodiments nutrition parameters can be retrieved from repository or over a network from a remote database. For example a restaurant or food producer may provide access to nutrition data in a remote database that is accessible by customers for purposes of evaluating nutrition for health and wellness. In at least some examples nutrition parameters can be determined via image capture with image recognition logic and or user input. An example of the use of image recognition logic is shown in .

Health and wellness evaluator is configured to acquire data representing acquired parameters describing the various aspects of health and wellness of a user including but not limited to nutrition related characteristics sleep related characteristics movement related characteristics environmental characteristics social related characteristics among others. In particular health and wellness evaluator is configured to determine characteristics of an activity state or condition for a user. Health and wellness evaluator is further configured to identify the a specific activity and type of activity e.g. type of sleep movement nutritional intake etc. and generate data representing the units and types of the activities for specific aspects of health and wellness. In some examples health and wellness evaluator is configured to control manager coordinator which in turn is configured to facilitate assist with or control operations of various managers as well as interactions between the managers. The managers can operate cooperatively to tune or modify the interrelationships between multiple behaviors or activities of a user to maximize various aspects of health and wellness. For example manager coordinator can cause generation of recommendations to improve one or more scores of the same or different aspects of health and wellness. Exemplary operation of manager coordinator is described by way of several examples of tuning the interrelationships between multiple behaviors and activities of a user as described in .

In some embodiments health and wellness evaluator also is configured to compare a user s profile i.e. trend data representing aspects of health and wellness of a user against data representing one or more health and wellness deficiency profiles to determine whether a deficiency exists e.g. an irregular eating schedule a lack of proper hydration whether a nutrient deficit exists whether a user spends extraordinary time in the ice cream isle of a supermarket etc. . As described above manager coordinator is configured to provide recommendations to modify the user s behavior to optimize one or more scores including an overall score thereby optimizing the various user activities to facilitate improved health and wellness. Health and wellness evaluator can generate notifications and alerts e.g. graphical haptic audio or otherwise perceptible to a user to induce a user to modify user behavior or environmental social nutritional and or physical parameters to improve a user s health. For example a wearable device can vibrate to notify a user that a meal ought to be consumed at a certain time or a certain movement ought to be performed. In some examples health and wellness evaluator is configured to cause generation of a graphical representation on an interface to induce modification of an acquired parameter or to cause generation of a haptic related signal for providing vibratory feedback to induce modification of the acquired parameter.

Scores are calculated at relative to or associated with baseline parameters which can be associated with a reference value. For example data representing values e.g. points for one or more subsets of acquired parameters e.g. data via measurement sensor derivation etc. are determined based on reference values such as a total number of points for parameters set forth in the profile. For example a user may set as its goal to consume 45 milligrams of vitamin C per day per World Health Organization standards . At breakfast the user consumes a meal and receives about 22 milligrams. A profile includes data that equates 45 milligrams as 20 points i.e. a target score for this nutrient . In this case 20 points is a reference value i.e. the baseline parameter . As 22 milligrams which represents an acquired parameter e.g. units of 22 mg and type of vitamin C nutrient is approximately half of the goal the user receives 10 points as the value. Scores can be calculated at a first processor based on data representing the values whereby the score representing an attained portion of the one or more health related activities. That is a score can be determined as an overall score to include one or more of nutrition scores sleep scores activity scores context scores or any other score and the like. The overall score is indicative of an ability of a user to achieve a targeted level of health and wellness and can represent the user s progress for example on a daily basis in meeting a target score. The overall score can be express as a percentage of the target score such as 71 with 100 points set as the target score.

At at least one score can be adjusted toward or away from the target score. For example if the user is agrees to spend time with active friends then the user is awarded positive points to encourage socializing with people more likely to assist the user in reaching its health and wellness goals. But if a user spends a certain amount of time at a bar or in the dessert isle of a supermarket then points are deducted from its overall score to encourage the user to avoid tempting locations. At a decision is made as to whether to implement feedback. If so flow moves to at which characteristics of health and wellness are identified for modification to urge the user to improve scores which in turn represents improved health. At the modifications are implemented.

At the determination of a score can be modified relative to a threshold. For example when the overall score exceeds the target score the rate at which the overall score can be reduced as a function of the difference between the overall score and the target score. That is it gets more difficult to accrue points for the overall score when exceeding the target score. For example for overall scores between 100 and 110 it is 50 harder to obtain overall score points e.g. 25 fewer points are rewarded for overall scores between 111 and 125 it is 75 harder to obtain overall score points and for overall scores above 126 it is 100 harder. At a classification for a user can be either leveled up or down. For example a subset of overall scores can be determined and the classification associated with a user can be changed based on the subset of overall scores. The classification can be changed by leveling up to a first health and wellness profile if the subset of overall scores is associated with a first range or the classification can be changed by leveling down to a second health and wellness profile if the subset of overall scores is associated with a second range. The first range of activity scores are nearer to the target score than the second range of activity scores. To illustrate if the overall score is 95 of the target score e.g. for a duration the user is either leveled up or provided the opportunity to level up to implement for example a new value of a parameter of a different health and wellness profile. But if the sleep score is 70 or less of the target score the user is given the option to level down e.g. to a less ambitious or rigorous health and wellness profile . In this manner the target score is dynamically altered just beyond the current limitations of the user to induce or otherwise motivate the user to work harder and strive to attain the new target score and ultimately a healthy lifestyle. At flow determines whether to continue monitoring and moves to to do so. At other parameters are acquired and further monitoring is performed. Note that more or less blocks elements actions or steps of flow can be implemented and note further that flow is not intended to be limiting.
