This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 587 531 filed on Feb. 9 2012 and entitled INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION CLOUD COMPUTING SYSTEMS AND METHODS. This application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 162 315 filed on Jun. 4 2002 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 151 966 on Dec. 19 2006 and entitled SYSTEM AND METHODOLOGY PROVIDING OPEN INTERFACE AND DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING IN AN INDUSTRIAL CONTROLLER ENVIRONMENT. The entireties of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The subject application relates generally to industrial automation and more particularly to provision of industrial automation applications using a cloud based provisioning system.

Early industrial automation systems were purely hardware based comprising complicated networks of relays switches timers logic gates and other such elements. With the advent of the programmable logic controller PLC many of these cumbersome hardware elements were replaced by equivalent software solutions significantly reducing the size and complexity of automation systems. Over time more aspects of the industrial automation process have come to rely on software based solutions including visualization e.g. human machine interfaces control loop tuning motor drive configuration lot tracking historical data collection production reporting etc. Moreover recently developed software products have made it possible to integrate plant floor operations with higher level business considerations allowing both levels to more easily coordinate their activities to achieve desired goals of the business enterprise as a whole. Such software products include enterprise resource planning ERP software manufacturing execution system MES software and other such applications.

As new industrial software products are introduced into the market place there is an increasing reliance on such industrial software applications for the day to day operation of modern industrial automation systems and associated business planning.

The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview nor is intended to identify key critical elements or to delineate the scope of the various aspects described herein. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

One or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate to cloud based provisioning of industrial automation applications. To this end an industrial application provisioning system can be made available to developers and end users on a cloud platform. Industrial application developers can submit pre tested industrial applications to an application library associated with the cloud based application provisioning system. A client interface for the provisioning system can allow the developer to associate metadata with the application that can be used by the provisioning system to categorize the application in the library for simplified searching and browsing. In some embodiments this metadata can specify a particular industry control system type device equipment type or vendor to which the submitted application relates.

The cloud based provisioning system can include a search engine that allows an end user or another developer having access to the cloud platform to quickly and easily search for a desired industrial automation application as well as related components modules and or extension packs for such applications. By virtue of the category metadata associated with the respective applications and their associated components the user can search the cloud based library for relevant industrial automation applications based on such criteria as the industry type equipment in use automation application e.g. motor control batch processing welding etc. or other such criteria. Authorized users can also apply a ranking to selected applications in the library indicating a perceived quality of the selected applications for the consideration of other potential users of the applications.

In another aspect the industrial application provisioning system can search for or filter applications in the cloud based library based on contextual data obtained from the client. For example a local search client associated with the provisioning system can determine one or more data structures devices or equipment in use at a customer s facility and leverage this data to select a subset of industrial applications determined to be of potential relevance to the customer s automation system.

In one or more embodiments the cloud based provisioning system can download selected applications to an end user s local cloud capable device. Alternatively the cloud based provisioning system can allow users to execute selected applications on virtual machines residing on the cloud platform using the cloud s storage and processing resources thereby preserving the customer s local resources. These cloud resources can be allocated to an industrial enterprise for this purpose as a client specific cloud resource allocation.

Furthermore the term set as employed herein excludes the empty set e.g. the set with no elements therein. Thus a set in the subject disclosure includes one or more elements or entities. As an illustration a set of controllers includes one or more controllers a set of data resources includes one or more data resources etc. Likewise the term group as utilized herein refers to a collection of one or more entities e.g. a group of nodes refers to one or more nodes.

Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices components modules and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices components modules etc. and or may not include all of the devices components modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches also can be used.

The industrial application provisioning system is accessible by application developers and application users to facilitate publication and sharing of industrial automation applications via the cloud platform . In general industrial software applications can be developed and submitted to the industrial application provisioning system by a development workstation having cloud access capability. In an exemplary configuration development workstation may access the industrial application provisioning system through a separate cloud interface where the development workstation connects to the cloud interface through a physical or wireless local area network or radio link. In another exemplary configuration cloud interface may be integrated with the development workstation which accesses the cloud platform directly using the integrated cloud interface.

Client device typically associated with an industrial facility or enterprise can access one or more libraries of published industrial automation applications maintained by the industrial application provisioning system . Similar to the development workstation client device can access the industrial application provisioning system and associated cloud based services via a cloud interface which can be internal to the client device or a separate cloud gateway communicatively connected to the client device . Client device may be any suitable device capable of submitting search criteria to the industrial application provisioning system and receiving one or more industrial applications from the provisioning system including but not limited to a desktop computer a laptop or a cloud capable mobile device such as a mobile phone or tablet computer.

Client device can also be a cloud capable industrial device such as an industrial controller e.g. programmable logic controllers or other types of programmable automation controllers a field device such as sensor or a meter a motor drive a human machine interface HMIs station an industrial robot a barcode marker or reader a vision system device e.g. vision camera a smart welder or other such industrial devices. Allowing industrial devices to access the industrial application provisioning system either directly or through a protected cloud interface or gateway can offer a number of advantages such as allowing industrial devices to automatically retrieve updates to their native industrial software applications when such updates are published to the cloud platform . Industrial client devices may include smart configuration capability enabling the industrial devices to automatically detect and communicate with the cloud platform upon installation at a facility simplifying integration with existing cloud based provisioning data storage analysis or reporting services provided by the cloud platform .

Industrial application provisioning system can include a publish component a search component a retrieval component an interface component a subscription component a notification component one or more processors and memory . In various embodiments one or more of the publish component search component retrieval component interface component subscription component notification component one or more processors and memory can be electrically and or communicatively coupled to one another to perform one or more of the functions of the industrial application provisioning system . In some embodiments components and can comprise software instructions stored on memory and executed by processor s . The industrial application provisioning system may also interact with other hardware and or software components not depicted in . For example processor s may interact with one or more external user interface devices such as a keyboard a mouse a display monitor a touchscreen or other such interface devices.

Publish component can be configured to receive submission of an industrial automation application from a remote client device e.g. a development workstation having a cloud interface via a cloud platform and publish the industrial automation application to one or more application libraries . As illustrated in the one or more application libraries can be stored in memory . In some embodiments memory can comprise multiple storage devices e.g. a network of storage servers comprising a cloud platform to allow for storage of large numbers of industrial applications across multiple application libraries. Since industrial application provisioning system resides on a cloud platform the number of application libraries can be expanded as needed to accommodate a growing number of published industrial applications and related software components.

Search component can be configured to receive search criteria from a remote client device e.g. client device via cloud interface via the cloud platform and identify a subset of the industrial applications in the library matching the received criteria. Retrieval component can retrieve the subset of industrial applications identified by the search component and deliver the identified applications to the originator of the search request. This can include sending the industrial applications to the requesting client device over the cloud platform or sending only a set of indicators identifying the subset of industrial applications.

Interface component can be configured to establish communication and exchange data with remote devices. Accordingly interface component can authenticate a client device or user wishing to access the provisioning system receive industrial application submissions receive search criteria and send retrieved industrial applications and other user feedback to the remote devices.

One or more embodiments of the industrial application provisioning system can allow users to subscribe to receive notifications or application updates relating to selected industrial applications or application categories. Accordingly subscription component can be configured to receive and manage subscription requests from remote clients and notification component can be configured to deliver notifications to the remote clients when new or updated industrial applications corresponding to the subscription requests become available. For example subscription component can store association information e.g. in memory that associates a set of subscription criteria with one or more devices or users. The subscription component can then determine when a new industrial application or an update to an existing industrial application matching the subscription criteria is published to the application library and instruct notification component to deliver notifications to the subscribing client devices.

The one or more processors can perform one or more of the functions described herein with reference to the systems and or methods disclosed. Memory can be a computer readable storage medium or multiple storage media storing computer executable instructions and or information for performing the functions described herein with reference to the systems and or methods disclosed.

Exemplary industrial applications and related components suitable for storage in the application libraries can include but are not limited to industrial control programs or modular code segments for performing specific industrial control tasks e.g. applications that can generate and deliver control instructions to industrial devices based on analysis of near real time system data or other factors visualization applications externally defined graphical elements EDGE definitions that can be imported into a visualization application during interface screen development plant reporting applications Enterprise Resource Planning ERP applications manufacturing execution system MES software firmware for industrial devices software add ons for implementing electronic signatures or other such applications. In one or more embodiments the system can facilitate publication and retrieval of validated application code which is code that has been validated pursuant to one or more defined industry standards e.g. FDA validated code for pharmaceutical applications . The application libraries can also store certified code e.g. for safety related industrial applications and secure application code that has been digitally signed to ensure authenticity.

Configuration files or configuration data for industrial devices may also be published to application libraries for distribution to end users. For example in order to simplify configuration of a variable frequency drive for a desired mode of operation or for use in a particular type of automation application a configuration file containing parameter values for the drive can be published to application libraries . The parameter values represent device settings that configure the drive for the desired mode of operation. Thus an engineer or maintenance personnel can search for and retrieve the configuration file from the application libraries and apply the configuration file to the drive mitigating the need to determine suitable parameter values through trial and error during testing.

The application libraries may also include industrial software widgets or dashboards developed by original equipment manufacturers OEMs that facilitate monitor and or control of their proprietary equipment. In addition to the industrial applications and related components the application library can include associated help files usage tips frequently asked questions FAQs instructional videos or other such materials to guide users in connection with using the respective applications.

The industrial automation provisioning system can also be used to facilitate code sharing between software developers over the cloud platform. For example software developers working in geographically remote locations on a common software project may publish software fixes or new code blocks to the provisioning system so that co developers can access the new or updated code during development. Thus the industrial automation provisioning system can facilitate provisioning of not only complete industrial applications but also add on functional modules for such applications application upgrades or bug fixes extension packs etc. Publication and provisioning of such modular application components can be performed independently of the provisioning of the applications themselves.

As noted above the industrial application provisioning system can store industrial applications according to an industry specific hierarchical cataloging schema. That is application developers can publish their new or modified industrial applications according to pre defined industry specific categories and sub categories supported by the catalog s storage structure. Industrial application provisioning system can support a hierarchical arrangement of these categories and sub categories to simplify subsequent location and retrieval of industrial automation applications or code using browsable search features. Some embodiments of the provisioning system can also provide a means for application developers to define their own categories for a given industrial application thereby affording designers a degree of freedom in expanding the hierarchical storage structure of the application libraries as new areas of control evolve. The provisioning system also supports publishing of samples and documentation together with the published industrial applications.

Authorized application users wishing to locate and retrieve an industrial application can interact with the cloud based provisioning system through a search client served by the provisioning system to the user s client device. The search client can support keyword based querying of the libraries and or a browsable interface that allows the user to navigate the library hierarchy. Both keyword querying and browsed searching permit searching for a given industrial application based on such criteria as applicable industry e.g. automotive pharmaceutical waste water treatment etc. type of control project e.g. motion control batch processing material handling etc. type of application required or any other suitable pre defined or user defined category.

In some embodiments the industrial application provisioning system can serve a publishing interface to the developer s device designed to facilitate submission of the industrial application to the provisioning system. Using this publishing interface the developer can set values for the metadata tags data fields using tagging functionality provided by the publishing interface. Some metadata tag values may also be set automatically generated during development of application.

Control Type The type of industrial control to which the application relates. For example the Control Type field can indicate whether the application relates to discrete control systems or process control systems.

Industry The industry or business in which industrial application is intended to be used. Exemplary values for the Industry field include Automotive Pharmaceutical Wastewater Treatment Oil and Gas Power Food and Beverage Material Handling Metalforming or other suitable industrial categories.

Category and sub categories Hierarchical classification tiers used to determine how the industrial application is to be classified within the provisioning system s industry based hierarchy. The categories and sub categories can specify particular industrial devices or equipment that the industrial application is intended to monitor or control a type of industrial process in which the application is applicable e.g. batch processing material handling motion control vision die casting etc. a type of application e.g. HMI graphic widget controller code firmware etc. or other such pre defined or user defined sub categories.

Developer Creation Date Description Revision Name of the individual or organization submitting the industrial application date of creation functional description and revision number of industrial application .

Additional Search Terms Search terms and keywords not included in the other metadata fields that the developer wishes to associate with the industrial application to ensure the definition is identified in relevant catalog searches.

Platform Compatibility List of software platforms e.g. operating systems compatible with the industrial application .

Hardware Compatibility List of hardware platforms compatible with the industrial application . This field can include identification of one or more industrial devices on which the application is designed to execute or which the application is intended to monitor and or control.

User Ranking A quality ranking for the application calculated as an average or aggregate of quality rankings received from multiple users of the application . Such rankings can be provided to the provisioning system as user feedback from users who have downloaded and used the industrial application .

It is to be appreciated that the fields depicted in exemplary metadata tag are not intended to be exclusive nor does the metadata tag require all data fields depicted in in order to fall within the scope of this disclosure. For example metadata tag can also include fields indicating that the developer wishes to charge for use of the submitted industrial application . Such fields can include data specifying a desired purchase price for the industrial application and financial routing information instructing the provisioning system where to submit electronic payments received in conjunction with the download or use of the industrial application .

Additionally read write permissions for the respective fields can vary in accordance with their functions. For example the Creation Date field can be a read only field that is automatically set to the date when the industrial application was last modified. Other fields such as the Additional Search Terms field can have full read write attributes thereby allowing a user to enter data freely. Still other data fields can be populated by selecting an entry from a drop down menu or other list associated with the data field where such menus are provided by the client interface served by the provisioning system. In one or more embodiments the Control Type Industry Category and or Sub category fields can incorporate such drop down menus which can be populated by the provisioning system to correspond with the Control Type Industry Categories and Sub categories comprising the storage hierarchy of the application library.

As discussed above industrial applications submitted to the provisioning system of the present disclosure can be classified within a cloud based application library according to a hierarchy of industry specific categories to facilitate guiding a user to a desired industrial application. depicts an example of such a hierarchy. In this example industrial applications are organized within a three tiered hierarchy comprising a Control Type tier an Industry tier and a Sub Category tier with each tier comprising one or more classification nodes having appropriate navigational interdependencies. Although depicts only three tiers it is to be appreciated that additional tiers can be included within the hierarchy without deviating from the scope of this disclosure.

Two exemplary Control Type classifications are depicted in Discrete Control and Process Control . Each of these Control Type classifications are shown as having respective Industry classifications with each Industry classification having one or more sub categories specifying a particular type of industrial process within the respective industries. Industrial applications stored in the provisioning system s libraries are cataloged within this browsable industry specific hierarchy such that groups of applications are associated with a pathway through the hierarchy. For example industrial application group includes applications relating to batch processing in the plastics industry. Since some industrial applications may be useful in multiple types of industrial processes a given industrial application may be associated with multiple paths in the hierarchy .

It is to be appreciated that the hierarchical format depicted in is only intended to be exemplary and that any suitable arrangement of tiered categories can be employed without deviating from the scope of this disclosure. For example although Control Type is depicted as the highest tier of the example hierarchy in a possible alternative arrangement could assign Industry as the highest tier while the Control Type classifications could reside on a lower tier of the hierarchy branching from the Industry classifications. Moreover the hierarchy can comprise any number of hierarchical tiers to achieve a desired degree of classification granularity. By storing industrial applications in accordance with hierarchy users having access to the cloud platform can be guided to the subset of stored industrial applications suitable for their needs by navigating the hierarchical classifications until a desired subset is identified. To facilitate efficient browsing the set of Categories and Sub Categories depending from a given parent Industry can be specific to that industry ensuring that the selected set of stored industrial applications is progressively narrowed to include only those classifications and definitions that are industry appropriate as the user navigates the tiers of the hierarchy.

Application development environment runs on development workstation and is used to develop an industrial application which is to be submitted to the provisioning system . Application development environment can comprise any suitable design tool or programming platform that provides a developer the means to create or modify an industrial application for shared use. In some scenarios application development environment will be a stand alone development platform. However some embodiments of the industrial application provisioning system can provide a remote development environment to cloud capable computing devices for development testing and debugging of industrial applications. In such embodiments this cloud based development environment can allow users to leverage cloud resources e.g. storage processing bandwidth etc. to develop industrial applications for subsequent storage and publication on the provisioning system . To facilitate access to this cloud based development environment the provisioning system can serve a development interface to the development workstation that serves as an interface to the development environment. This can allow the development workstation to access and utilize the development environment from an authorized cloud capable device. In some embodiments the cloud based development environment can include integrated testing and simulation capability allowing applications in progress to be simulated tested and debugged using cloud resources provided by the cloud platform. Applications in development may also be stored on the cloud platform between development sessions. The use of cloud resources to develop industrial applications in this manner can also facilitate sharing of development tasks between geographically diverse application developers since multiple developers at different locations can access the application in progress from any authorized cloud capable computing device.

When a new or modified industrial application is ready for submission to the provisioning system the developer can invoke publishing client . The publishing client can be a remote web based client served by the provisioning system or a locally executed client on development workstation that can be invoked and communicatively linked to the provisioning system over the Internet. Publishing client can include functionality that allows a developer to associated metadata with the industrial application that can subsequently be used by the provisioning system to classify the industrial application within an industry specific storage hierarchy as discussed above in connection with . Publishing client can also include functionality that allows the developer to submit documentation for the industrial application to the provisioning system . When the developer has prepared the industrial application for submission and associated all desired metadata and documentation with the application publishing client can be instructed to send an industrial application submission to the provisioning system on the cloud platform. In some embodiments industrial application provisioning system may only allow application submission by registered users. Accordingly the provisioning system can perform a suitable authentication procedure to ensure that the user submitting the application submission is an authorized user of the system.

The industrial application submission is submitted to the provisioning system where a publish component adds the application to the industrial application library . Application library can be maintained on one or more data stores on the cloud platform. Publish component can parse the metadata tags included in the application submission e.g. metadata tags of to determine proper classification of the industrial application within the library s storage hierarchy. As discussed above in connection with the submitted industrial application can be classified within the library according to a hierarchy of industry specific categories to facilitate guiding a user to a desired industrial application suitable for a given industry and task. For example publish component can read the Control Type Industry Category and Sub Category fields of metadata tag of and associate the industrial application with the hierarchical path corresponding to the values in those fields. To facilitate simple and flexible cataloging of the industrial application publishing client can allow developers at development workstation to either select values for those fields from a list of classifications already existing in library or to define new designer supplied industry and or category classifications. Thus if publish component determines that a Sub Category field in metadata tags contains a new classification the publish component can create a new branch at an appropriate location within the library hierarchy corresponding to the new designer supplied classification and associate the new industrial application with this new pathway in the library .

In one or more embodiments location and retrieval of an industrial application can be effected by submitting keyword based search criteria to the provisioning system via search interface . Search interface submits the search criteria to the cloud based provisioning system across a generic Internet layer. Search criteria can comprise one or more keywords entered by the user using the search interface . Typically a user will submit keywords that identify one or more of an industrial domain a control type e.g. discrete control process control etc. a type of automation application a device or piece of equipment in use an industry standard or any other terms that can be used by the provisioning system to identify a desired subset of industrial applications stored in industrial application library . In one or more embodiments a subset of the search criteria can also be inferred by the search interface based in part on extrinsic data relating to the user s existing control system as will be discussed in more detail below.

When search criteria is submitted to the provisioning system an interface component receives the search criteria and passes the criteria to a search component which identifies a subset of industrial applications stored in application library similar to application library of of that satisfy the submitted criteria. To determine whether a given stored industrial application meets the search criteria search component can cross reference the search terms contained within the search criteria against the given industrial application s metadata tags hierarchy classifications inherent properties of the application e.g. parameters inputs and outputs data types animation types etc. or other defined or inherent properties of the industrial application.

Moreover one or more embodiments of search component can support approximate match searching such that exact matches between the submitted search criteria and a potentially relevant industrial application s metadata or properties is not necessary in order for the industrial application to be selected for inclusion in the retrieved subset. In this regard any suitable fuzzy search methodology can be employed to ensure that useful industrial applications are returned even in the absence of an exact match. In one exemplary approach upon receipt of search criteria search component can calculate one or more figures of merit for each industrial application in the library relative to the search criteria. Each application s figure of merit is a relative measure of how relevant the given definition is likely to be to the search criteria. For example if a search criterion stipulates that a requested industrial application is to be used in an automotive HMI application the search component can generate an industry figure of merit for each industrial application in the library indicating a relative applicability to the automotive industry. Industrial applications whose metadata explicitly specifies automotive as an applicable industry will be given the highest figure of merit. Applications whose industry metadata specifies a different industry but having similarities to the automotive industry e.g. commonly employs similar equipment or processes often produces materials or products used by the automotive industry etc. will be given a comparatively high though not the highest figure of merit with respect to industrial applications designed for a non related industry. When all figures of merit have been identified search component can identify the subset of industrial applications having a figure of merit above a threshold value as being sufficiently relevant to the search criteria. According to one or more embodiments multiple figures of merit can be calculated for each industrial application for a given set of search criteria where each figure of merit relates to a particular search dimension or aspect e.g. industry control type category desired functionality etc. . In such embodiments a composite figure of merit can be computed based on the individual figures of merit for the various search dimensions and the relevant subset of industrial applications can be selected by the search component based on this composite value.

After the subset of relevant industrial applications from library has been identified the provisioning system can render a list of the identified applications on the search interface for selection by the user. Each item in the list can include a description of the application including information derived from the application s metadata e.g. control type industry function etc. . The search interface can receive input from the user indicating selection of one of the industrial applications in the list and inform the provisioning system of the user s selection. Based on the user selection the retrieval component retrieves the identified industrial application from the library .

In one or more embodiments libraries and described above can comprise centralized common libraries accessible to suitably authorized users across multiple locations and enterprises e.g. via a subscription service . In some embodiments the industrial application provisioning system can also allow users to create and maintain personal libraries on the cloud platform for storage of selected industrial applications or related software components. In such embodiments the system allows the user to import industrial applications or related components into their personal cloud based application library from other libraries e.g. the commonly accessible library described above or to publish their own user developed applications and related components to the personal library. Such personal application libraries can utilize a subset of cloud resources e.g. storage processing and or bandwidth allocated to the user or the user s business enterprise. The system can allow the user to configure these personal application libraries such that access to the applications and software components stored thereon is limited to authorized personnel within their company. In this way the system allows the user to build custom application libraries for personal or internal use comprising applications or associated software component of particular value or potential utility for the user or enterprise.

In some embodiments the provisioning system can provide the retrieved industrial application to the client device over the Internet for local usage. That is the selected industrial application can be downloaded from the provisioning system and stored on local storage at the client device. Alternatively some embodiments of the provisioning system can allow certain industrial applications to be run remotely using cloud resources provisioned to the user or to the industrial facility. illustrates remote execution of industrial applications using cloud resources assigned to respective industrial facilities. Client devices and at respective industrial facilities and can access industrial application provisioning system residing on a cloud platform. As in previous examples the client devices and can access the cloud platform through a generic Internet layer. In the present example each of the industrial facilities and are allocated respective cloud resource provisions and where the resource provisions and can comprise allocations of cloud storage processing and or bandwidth provided by the cloud platform for use by the respective industrial facilities and . For example an owner of the cloud platform may offer subscription services to industrial facilities for use of a predetermined amount of cloud resources which the facilities can use for off site data storage execution of cloud based applications or virtual machines using portions of the cloud platform s processing capacity or other such services.

As in previous examples client devices and can search for and retrieve desired industrial applications from the application library managed by provisioning system . However rather than downloading the selected applications to the client devices and for local use at the respective facilities and the selected applications can instead be executed on the cloud platform using each facility s allocated cloud resources and . In some cases cloud based execution of industrial applications may not be appropriate as in the case of industrial applications comprising controller code designed to control plant floor machinery. However many industrial applications could beneficially be maintained and executed remotely on the cloud platform as illustrated in . Such applications can include for example reporting applications ERP and MES systems applications designed to notify plant personnel when certain predefined plant floor conditions occur or other such applications.

In addition to query based searching one or more embodiments of the industrial application provisioning system can also support browsed searching of the industrial application library by allowing the user to navigate the classification hierarchy until a desired industrial application is found. Returning now to search interface can provide a browsable interface that allows the user to select classifications corresponding to the classification nodes of the library hierarchy e.g. hierarchy of . For example search interface can present a list of industries represented in the library hierarchy on a home menu. Selection of an industry from this list can cause the search interface to submit a corresponding browsing selection to interface component of the provisioning system which routes the browsing selection to the search component for processing. Search component can retrieve control types application types categories sub categories and other classifications associated with the selected industry. Interface component returns this information to the search interface which can render the available categories associated with the selected industry and optionally a list of industrial applications associated with all categories and sub categories depending from the selected industry. The list of industrial applications can be gradually narrowed as the user navigates through lower tiers of the hierarchy in this manner until the user selects an industrial application from the list or until a lowest tier of the hierarchy is reached.

One or more embodiments of the provisioning system described herein can also support implementation of corporate filters to limit selection and retrieval of applications to a subset of pre approved industrial applications or application types. For example some industries may require that all software used in connection with control and operation of an industrial process conform to a defined set of standards see for example the 21 CFR Part 11 standards applied to the food and drug industry . Additionally some industrial facilities may have their own set of internally defined standards or may wish to simplify the search and retrieval process by limiting the applications returned by the provisioning system only to those applications relevant to the facility s particular industry. To ensure that only pre approved code is retrieved from the provisioning system one or more embodiments of the industrial application provisioning system can allow each industrial customer to define a set of corporate filters to be applied to all application searches made by plant personnel.

As discussed above some embodiments of the industrial application provisioning system can infer at least a portion of the application search criteria based in part on extrinsic data read from the user s existing control system. For example certain control data structures code segments or HMI graphical elements may suggest that the user s existing system relates to a particular industry or type of industrial system or may help to identify particular devices or equipment in use at the industrial facility without requiring the user to explicitly provide such information to the provisioning system. illustrates an exemplary application provisioning system that leverages information from a user s existing control system to infer search criteria for locating relevant industrial applications on a cloud platform. As in previous examples a client device can use a search interface either locally executed or served remotely by the provisioning system to access industrial application provisioning system . In the present example search interface includes a search criteria generation component that can poll an automation device e.g. an automation controller an HMI terminal etc. in use at the industrial facility. In particular the search criteria generation component can poll an automation program running on automation device such as an automation controller program e.g. ladder logic sequential function chart program etc. an HMI application or the like and determine one or more control data structures e.g. function blocks code segment equipment identifiers graphical elements etc. indicative of a particular industry device in use or control application type. Based on these control data structures the search criteria generation component can then infer an industry control type application type or other characteristics of the user s control system and generate at least a portion of search criteria based on these inferences. Such techniques can at least partially automate the process of locating suitable industrial applications maintained on the provisioning system .

Consider an example in which automation application is a controller program residing on automation device which can be an industrial controller e.g. programmable logic or automation controller . The control program can include a number of control data structures that assist with data management and instruction processing within the program such as control instructions memory tags of various data types I O module configurations etc.

According to one or more embodiments the search criteria generation component can read one or more control data structures from the automation application . Control data structures extracted by the search criteria generation component can include but are not limited to controller tags and their associated data types e.g. real integer binary double string etc. instructions and or function blocks used in the control program and any metadata associated with the various program elements. Search criteria generation component can also read as control data structures configuration information for the I O modules associated with the automation device which are used to exchange digital and analog signaling between the automaton application and field devices comprising the controlled system.

Upon reading the one or more control data structures from automation program search criteria generation component can make an inference regarding industrial equipment in use e.g. devices being monitored and or controlled by automation application an industry to which the automation application relates a type of process being controlled by automation application or other relevant characteristics of the user s system. For example if a particular control data structure in automation application indicates that a particular type of variable frequency drive VFD is being controlled by automation application as part of the broader system control the search criteria generation component may generate search criteria designed to locate a graphical object e.g. EDGE definition representing the identified VFD a widget designed to read and display operational data for the identified VFD code segments relating to motor control applications or other such applications determined to be relevant. In another example the control data structures may indicate that the automation device includes an I O module designed to control a particular type of servo motor. Accordingly based on the presence of these control data structures in the automation application the search criteria generation component can generate search criteria including the name of the vendor of the servo motor keywords relating to servo control or motion control in general or other such criteria.

In some cases the generated search criteria can be based in part on a pre defined mapping between particular data structures e.g. function blocks metadata keywords I O modules in use etc. and relevant search terms. For example the pre defined mapping can associate a controller tag s data type with a particular set of search criteria. In another example a control data structure identifying an I O module in use can also be mapped to another set of search criteria. Likewise control data structures representing instructions used within a controller program can be associated with yet another set of search criteria. In this way some embodiments of the search criteria generation component can allow a user to pre specify search criteria to be submitted to the provisioning system for respective types of control data structures .

In some embodiments the provisioning system search interface can further allow a user to define usage based associations between control data structures and industrial application search criteria. That is an associative link between a control data structure and one or more sets of search criteria can be conditional on how the control data structure is used in automation application e.g. in which subroutine or control module of the control program the control structure is located . As an example of such a mapping a user can specify that controller tags having a REAL data type and located in a Die Cast subroutine are to be associated with bar graph display objects while similar tags located in a Sand Casting subroutine are to be associated with line graph display objects.

Search criteria generation component can read a control data structure from automaton application and cross reference this control data structure with the pre defined mapping. Using this information search criteria generation component can generate provisioning system search criteria for the control data structure based on the mapping of preferred display object types. That is for a given control data structure read from automation application the search criteria generation component can generate search criteria for locating one or more suitable graphical elements e.g. EDGE definitions GUI components etc. that can be imported into an HMI application or added to a computer desktop as a widget for visualization of and or operator interaction with the control data structure.

The automatically generated search criteria can be submitted alone or in combination with additional user entered search criteria. As described in previous examples the search criteria can be provided to search component of provisioning system e.g. through cloud interface and retrieval component can retrieve selected industrial applications identified by the search criteria from application library .

Although search criteria generation component is depicted in as refining the search criteria based on control data structures read from automation application one or more embodiments are also contemplated wherein search criteria generation component can poll an industrial network to identify other field devices comprising the automation system. For example search criteria generation component can scan the network to discover devices or equipment in use as part of the automation system. Search criteria generation component can identify such devices by reading an identifier inherent in the device such as a media access control MAC address. Search criteria generation component can then generate search criteria based on the device identifier to locate and retrieve any relevant industrial applications relating to such devices e.g. graphical objects for visualizing the identified devices on an HMI application code blocks for controlling the identified equipment etc. .

One or more embodiments of the industrial application provisioning system can also allow users to subscribe to receive notifications of updates or revisions to selected industrial applications in the library. An exemplary cloud based provisioning system having subscribe and notify capabilities is illustrated in . Client devices can be similar to client devices and of . That is the client devices can be authorized cloud capable devices having access to industrial application provisioning system residing on cloud platform for publishing and sharing of industrial applications. In the present example application provisioning system can include a subscription component which receives requests from one or more of the client device to subscribe to selected industrial applications or categories of applications. A request to subscription component can be explicitly submitted by a user e.g. via search interface of . For example users at the respective client devices can browse to a selected industrial application as described supra and flag the application for future notifications. The subscription component can also provide a means for the user to enter a preferred contact method for receiving notifications of revisions made to the selected industrial applications e.g. an email address cell phone number etc. . Alternatively subscription component can automatically subscribe a client device to receive notifications relating to a given industrial application when the client retrieves the industrial application from the application library maintained by the provisioning system . Such automated subscriptions presume that a user will wish to acquire future revisions of an industrial application retrieved by the user for use in an industrial system. Subscription component can maintain a list of received subscription requests in a subscribers database . Records in subscribers database can include for example a user identifier an industrial application identifier a preferred notification method e.g. email text message voice message etc. and any other suitable subscription information.

Provisioning system can further include a notification component that works in conjunction with subscription component . Notification component monitors the industrial application library and in particular tracks revisions made to individual industrial applications stored therein. For instance if a new industrial application is published to the library e.g. using the techniques described above in connection with notification component can determine if the newly published industrial application is a revision of a pre existing industrial application in the library. Notification component can make this determination for example by reading relevant information in the metadata tags see .

Upon determining that the newly published industrial application is a revision of a previously published application notification component can reference subscribers database to determine if any users are subscribed to receive notifications relating to the previously published application which served as an antecedent for the new application. If so notification component can send a notification to the subset of clients on the subscription list that a new revision of the industrial application is available for retrieval from the cloud based library . Such notifications can be transmitted by the notification component to each user s preferred contact destination as defined in the subscriptions. Notification component can transmit the notifications to the appropriate users according to each user s preferred notification method as indicated in the respective subscriptions including but not limited to email text message voice message notification via the catalog client etc.

The industrial application provisioning system of this disclosure provides a means for developers to share their industry and application specific industrial applications with other users over a cloud platform allowing users and application developers to easily leverage the experience and expertise of other developers. While some application developers may wish to publish their industrial applications for free distribution it is understood that other application developers may wish to charge a license fee for the download and use of their applications. Accordingly one or more embodiments of the industrial application provisioning system can include a licensing component that determines whether a requested application is associated with a license requirement as illustrated in . In one or more exemplary embodiments when an industrial application is published to the cloud based library the metadata tags for the published application can include a field indicating whether the developer of the application wishes to apply a license requirement to the application. Associated fields can allow the application developer to specify a type of license unlimited use single instance use etc. a desired license fee and payment routing information. When one or more authorized client devices subsequently submit a request for the licensed industrial application through cloud platform interface component similar to interface component of passes the request to the retrieval component for processing as described above in connection with . According to the embodiment s illustrated in retrieval component can include a licensing component that determines whether the requested industrial application has a publisher defined license requirement.

If a license requirement is identified a payment component can send a prompt to the client device from which the request was received instructing the user that a payment must be submitted before the industrial application can be retrieved for use. Alternatively the industrial application can be provided to the client device on a provisional trial basis such that usage rights will be terminated after a defined period of time unless a license payment is received within the defined time frame. The provisioning system can provide an interface that allows the user to submit the payment electronically e.g. by allowing the user to enter bank account routing information credit or debit card information electronic payment transfer information or any other suitable payment method . Payment component can receive the electronic payment information and route the payment information to the necessary financial institutions determined based on the financial information provided by the industrial application developer via the metadata tags . When payment has been confirmed retrieval component can retrieve the requested industrial application and deliver the application to the client device or allow usage of the application on a set of cloud resources provisioned to the user.

At the cloud based application provisioning system reads metadata submitted with the industrial application. This metadata can be used to categorize the application in the library for simplified searching and browsing as described above in connection with . At the application provisioning system parses classification information contained within the metadata. As discussed above this classification information can include information regarding the industry or type of control system to which the application relates particular industrial devices or equipment that the industrial application is intended to monitor or control or other such classification categories. At the application provisioning system publishes the industrial application in a searchable library accessible through the cloud platform. The library catalogs the industrial application according to a searchable classification hierarchy as described above in connection with .

At a library of stored industrial applications is filtered according to the received search criteria. The stored industrial applications can be cataloged in the library according to an industry specific classification hierarchy as described in previous examples and the industrial application provisioning system can filter the stored applications to identify a subset of industrial applications matching the received search criteria. At a selection of one of the filtered industrial applications is received from the client device where the selection indicates that the identified industrial application is to be made available for use by a user of the client device or an industrial enterprise with which the user is affiliated.

At it is determined whether the selected industrial application is to be run as a virtual machine on the cloud platform or alternatively if the selected industrial application is to be downloaded to the client device for local execution. If the selected industrial application is to be run as a virtual machine the method moves to step where the selected industrial application is made available for execution on a set of cloud resources provisioned to the user as described above in connection with . In some embodiments an industrial facility associated with the client device can subscribe to use a predetermined amount of cloud resources for the purpose of executing applications remotely utilizing a portion of the cloud platform s storage or processing capacity or other such cloud services. Alternatively if it is determined that the selected industrial application is not to be run as a virtual machine at the method moves to step where the selected industrial application is delivered to the client device for local usage.

At industrial application search criteria is generated or refined in accordance with the inferred industry equipment or type of control application determined at step . The search criteria can be designed to locate a subset of stored industrial applications that may be relevant to the automation system in use based on the inferred information about the automation system determined at step . At the search criteria generated at step is submitted to an industrial application provisioning system that maintains a library of published industrial applications on a cloud platform. The provisioning system can return a subset of the published industrial application applications determined to be potentially relevant to the user s automation system.
