The electronic device includes a flash . The flash may in at least some embodiments be a light emitting diode LED flash. The flash emits electromagnetic radiation. More particularly the flash may be used to produce a brief bright light which may facilitate picture taking in low light conditions. That is the flash may emit light while an image is captured using the camera . In the embodiment illustrated the flash is located to emit light at the rear face of the electronic device . That is the flash is a rear facing flash in the illustrated embodiment. The electronic device may include a front facing flash instead of or in addition to the rear facing flash to emit light at the front face of the electronic device . The electronic device may have additional camera hardware which may complement the camera .

Still referring to a lens covers the image sensor of the camera and the flash . The lens allows light to pass though e.g. from the flash to the exterior of the housing or from the exterior of the housing to the image sensor and prevents debris or dirt from entering into the housing.

Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The electronic device may include a touchscreen display in some example embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller. The touch sensitive input surface overlays the display and may be referred to as a touch sensitive overlay. The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input interface and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller. That is the touchscreen display acts as both an input interface and an output interface .

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the electronic device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter as is known in the art. The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which the electronic device is intended to operate.

The electronic device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control.

The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents images and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device by its user and other data. The data may in at least some embodiments include metadata which may store information about the images . While the metadata is illustrated separately from the images in some embodiments the metadata and the images may be stored together. That is a single file may include both an image and also metadata regarding that image. For example in at least some embodiments the image may be formatted and stored as a JPEG image.

The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the electronic device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases or data stores each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the electronic device memory.

The data port may be used for synchronization with a user s host computer system. The data port enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device through a direct reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.

In some example embodiments the electronic device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the electronic device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer for processing.

The electronic device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the electronic device .

The short range communication module provides for communication between the electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the short range communication module may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

In the embodiment illustrated the camera is illustrated as being coupled directly with a main processor which controls the camera. In at least some embodiments the camera may include a dedicated image signal processor which may provide at least some camera related functions. For example in at least some embodiments the image signal processor of the camera may be configured to provide auto focusing functions. Functions or features which are described below with reference to the camera application may in at least some embodiments be provided in whole or in part by the image signal processor.

The electronic device also includes a flash . As noted above the flash is used to illuminate a subject while the camera captures an image of the subject. The flash may for example be used in low light conditions. In the example embodiment illustrated the flash is coupled with the main processor of the electronic device . However in other embodiments the flash may be coupled to an image signal processor not shown of the camera which may be used to trigger the flash. The image signal processor may in at least some embodiments control the flash . In at least some such embodiments applications associated with the main processor may be permitted to trigger the flash by providing an instruction to the image signal processor to instruct the image signal processor to trigger the flash .

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications may be installed on the electronic device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to an operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the electronic device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range communication module or other suitable device subsystems . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory e.g. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime.

In some example embodiments the electronic device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or webpage download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded webpage may be further processed by a web browser or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using an input interface in conjunction with the display . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the electronic device provides telephony functions and may operate as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. a voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output may be accomplished primarily through the speaker the display may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules such as applications stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules may include operating system software and one or more additional applications or modules such as for example a camera application . The processor may also operate to process data stored in memory associated with the electronic device .

In the example embodiment of the camera application is illustrated as being implemented as a stand alone application . However in other example embodiments the camera application could be provided by another application or module such as for example the operating system software . Further while the camera application is illustrated with a single block the functions or features provided by the camera application could in at least some embodiments be divided up and implemented by a plurality of applications and or modules.

The camera application may for example be configured to provide a viewfinder on the display by displaying in real time or near real time an image defined in the electronic signals received from the camera . The camera application may also be configured to capture an image or video by storing an image or video defined by the electronic signals received from the camera . For example the camera application may be configured to store an image or video to memory of the electronic device .

The camera application may also be configured to control options or preferences associated with the camera . For example the camera application may be configured to control a camera lens aperture and or a shutter speed. The control of such features may in at least some embodiments be automatically performed by the camera software based on output received from a light exposure meter.

In at least some embodiments the camera application may be configured to focus the camera on a subject. For example the camera application may be configured to control an actuator of the camera to move a lens which is comprised of one or more lens elements in the camera relative to an image sensor in the camera . For example when capturing images of subjects which are very close to the camera e.g. subject at macro position the camera application may control the actuator to cause the actuator to move the lens away from the image sensor.

In at least some embodiments the camera application may provide for auto focusing capabilities. For example the camera application may analyze received electronic signals to determine whether the images captured by the camera are in focus. That is the camera application may determine whether the images defined by electronic signals received from the camera are focused properly on the subject of such images. The camera application may for example make this determination based on the sharpness of such images. If the camera application determines that the images are not in focus then the camera application may cause the processor to adjust the actuator which controls the lens to focus the image.

In at least some embodiments the camera application may be configured to control a flash associated with the camera and or to control a zoom associated with the camera . In at least some embodiments the camera application is configured to provide digital zoom features. The camera application may provide digital zoom features by cropping an image down to a centered area with the same aspect ratio as the original. In at least some embodiments the camera application may interpolate within the cropped image to bring the cropped image back up to the pixel dimensions of the original. The camera application may in at least some embodiments provide image stabilization for the camera. Image stabilization may reduce blurring associated with movement of the camera .

In at least some embodiments the metadata designating an image as either a primary image or a secondary image may be used when displaying images. For example in at least some embodiments the camera application may provide a slideshow mode in which a slideshow of images may be displayed on a display of the electronic device. The slideshow may exclude images designated as secondary images until a command to toggle to a secondary image is received via an input interface while an image designated as a primary image is displayed. In response to receiving such an input the camera application may cause the secondary image which is associated with the displayed primary image i.e. the secondary image which was captured at approximately the same time as the displayed primary image to be displayed. That is in the slideshow mode the electronic device may only display primary images unless a specific instruction is received instructing the electronic device to display a secondary image.

The software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

Light that emanates from the flash can be used to illuminate a subject while the camera captures the image of the subject. For example light from the flash reflects off the subject and is received at the image sensor associated with the camera . The image sensor can be attached to the camera for example. Unwanted light can emanate from the flash and cause interference with the image sensor or with light received at the image sensor which can negatively affect the quality of image or video captured by the camera . For example light emanating from the flash can appear as a reflection or glare on images or video captured by the camera . The severity of the effect of this interference or crosstalk is often directly related to the distance between the flash and the image sensor on the electronic device or associated with the camera . Such interference can be worse if there is a clear or transparent path between the flash and the image sensor through which light can travel. For example if a single transparent lens is used to cover both the image sensor and flash then there may be a path in the glass lens through which light can travel or be reflected from the flash to the image sensor thus causing interference with the light otherwise received at the image sensor. As detailed below a combined camera and flash lens with an etched portion may be used to counteract minimize or limit the interference problem.

The combined lens can be mounted on or contained inside of the housing of the electronic device . When the lens is mounted on or contained inside of the housing the image sensor portion of the lens is configured to cover the image sensor. Similarly when the lens is mounted on or contained inside of the housing the flash portion of the lens is configured to cover the flash . For example when the combined lens is mounted on or contained inside the housing the lens is positioned such that the flash portion covers the flash and the image sensor portion covers the image sensor as shown in described below . The flash portion and the image sensor portion on the combined lens are configured to align with the flash and image sensor respectively when the lens is in use or when it is secured to the housing.

In accordance with the example embodiment illustrated in when the lens is mounted to the housing the flash portion of the lens is aligned with the flash so as to allow light to pass therethrough and the image sensor portion is aligned with the image sensor to allow light to pass therethrough. The lens can be connected to the housing such that the lens extends from one side of the housing to the other. Or in an alternative embodiment the lens may cover the flash and image sensor but may not extend to either side of the housing. In a further embodiment the lens may cover a majority of the rear face or front face as the case may be of the electronic device . The lens can be mounted to the housing such that the outer surface of the lens or the mask if the mask is attached to the outer surface of the lens is flush with the outer surface of the housing i.e. the rear face in the case of a rear facing camera . In a further embodiment the lens is not supported by the housing. For example the lens may be supported by the camera and or the flash or another component of the electronic device .

In one or more embodiments there may be additional lens elements underneath the lens that may be between the image sensor and image sensor portion . For example the additional lens elements may be associated with or attached to the camera and controlled by an actuator as described above.

In an alternative embodiment the combined lens can be contained within the housing such that a first opening in the housing aligns with the image sensor portion of the lens and a second opening in the housing aligns with the flash portion . Similarly the image sensor and the flash can also be aligned with the first and second openings in the housing respectively so that light can pass through the first and second openings in the housing and through the flash portion and image sensor portion of the combined lens . In such an embodiment the mask and the portion of the lens that does not include the flash portion and the image sensor portion may be contained within the housing. In further embodiments there is an adhesive seal on the lens for securing the lens to the interior of the housing.

In an embodiment the mask is secured to a surface of the lens . For example the mask can be printed on a surface of the lens using a screen printing process or can be attached to the lens in another manner. The mask can be a thin pliable or resilient sheet of plastic e.g. thinner than the lens and is not transparent. For example the mask can be a dark colour e.g. black brown etc. so as to prevent or limit light from passing through. In one or more embodiments the mask defines a flash opening and an image sensor opening. When the mask is secured to the lens the flash opening is aligned with the flash portion of the lens such that the mask does not prohibit limit or block light from passing through the flash portion . Similarly when the mask is secured to the lens the image sensor opening is aligned with the image sensor portion such that the mask does not prohibit limit or block light from passing through the image sensor portion .

In one or more embodiments there is no mask attached or secured to the lens . In an alternative embodiment a portion of the lens not including the flash portion and the image sensor portion is tinted. For example there can be up to a 5 tint on the lens .

The shape of the image sensor portion can be different than that of the remainder of the combined lens to accommodate the lens requirements for the image sensor. Similarly the shape of the flash portion can also be different from the shape of the remainder of the combined lens in order to accommodate the needs of the flash . For example in an embodiment the image sensor portion and or the flash portion are concave and the remainder of the combined lens is generally planar. Similarly the arc of the curve of the flash portion can be different from the arc of the curve of the image sensor portion which can also be different from the arc of the curve of the lens .

With reference to the lens has a bottom surface and a top surface . In the embodiment illustrated in the figures the mask is secured to the top surface . It is recognized that in other embodiments the mask may be secured to the bottom surface or may not be present at all. For example the lens can be laser printed on to the bottom surface of the lens . The bottom surface of the lens is proximal to the flash and the camera which includes the image sensor when the lens is secured to or on the housing. The lens flash and camera can be configured such that the flash portion forms a lens for the flash and the image sensor portion forms a lens for the image sensor which is part of the camera . For example the flash portion allows light to pass from the flash to exterior of the housing and electronic device . Similarly the image sensor portion of the lens allows light to pass from the exterior of the electronic device to the image sensor.

The flash has a flash section proximal the image sensor and the image sensor has an image sensor section that is proximal the flash . The flash section is the point on the flash that is closest to the image sensor. Similarly the image sensor section is the point on the image sensor that is closest to the flash . The distance between the image sensor section and the flash section is intended to measure the distance generally between the flash and the image sensor. The distance between the flash section and the image sensor section is the in the range of 1 to 3 millimeters. Further the distance between the center of the flash and the center of the image sensor is in the range of 7 to 15 millimeters. In some embodiments when the distance between the center of the image sensor and the center of the flash is greater than 15 millimeters the light emanating from the flash does not interfere with the image sensor.

The etching can be formed in the combined lens using a laser for example and can be formed in the lens before the lens is secured to or in the housing.

The etching is formed in the lens in a position that is adjacent to the flash portion . According to different embodiments the etching can be shaped into different patterns and can have different configurations in relation to the combined lens . For example as shown in the etching can form a boundary between the flash portion and the image sensor portion by running between two edges of the lens . The etching is shown as a straight line in however the etching can be other than a straight line e.g. the etching can be a curved line or another shape such as a circle or rectangle . In another embodiment with reference to the etching surrounds or encircles the flash portion . It is understood that the etching need not entirely surround the flash potion . For example the etching can form a partial circle or arc around a part of the flash portion . In another embodiment the etching surrounds or encircles the image sensor portion . It is understood that the etching need not entirely surround the image sensor potion . For example the etching can form a partial circle or arc around a part of the image sensor potion .

In another embodiment shown in the etching forms a partial boundary between the flash portion and the image sensor portion . The partial boundary can define a line as in a circle a curve or another pattern or shape. It is recognized that there are many other configurations positions shapes and patterns that the etching can define in the lens .

It is recognized that there can be more than one etching in the lens . For example in an embodiment the etching comprises a first etching and a second etching with the first etching surrounding the flash portion and the second etching surrounding the image sensor portion . It is understood that the first etching and second etching can have different shapes or patterns. For example the first etching can surround the flash portion e.g. with a circle shape with the second etching defining a boundary or a line between the flash portion and the image sensor portion .

In an embodiment the lens has a thickness of between 1 millimeter and 1.5 millimeters. It is understood that variations on the dimensions thickness and configuration of the lens may be used.

Etching a glass lens such as an embodiment of the combined lens can be performed using a computer guided laser. Etching glass with such a laser can result in void spaces or pores or vacuums in the glass. In accordance with an embodiment illustrated in the etching in the combined lens defines one or more void spaces within the lens . Each void space is a pore or space interior of the glass and that is entirely surrounded by or sealed in by the glass. The void spaces formed in the combined lens can be in the shape of columns for example. The void spaces in the lens illustrated in defines three parallel lines. Each line comprises a series of void spaces defined by the etching . It is recognized that as described in reference to and the etching can define different patterns and need not comprise three parallel lines. For example the etching can define one line one circle surrounding the flash portion one circle surrounding the image sensor portion or a variety of other shapes. illustrates a close up view of void spaces of shown from a side elevation view. Each of the three lines of void spaces are spaced apart. In one or more alternative embodiments the etching of the combined lens can result in one or more holes e.g. a series of holes in the lens . For example one or more holes can extend from the top surface through the lens to the bottom surface .

Light emanating from the flash can be dispersed or controlled by the etching . Thus the etching can limit minimize prevent or reduce the amount of light emanating from the flash that passes through the combined lens and interferes with the light received at the image sensor.

It is further recognized that other methods of etching the lens can be used to etch an external surface of the lens such as cutting or etching using diamonds water or sand. Etching the external surface of the lens can limit transmission of light through the bottom or top surface of the lens thus assisting in limiting interference with the image sensor.

According to another embodiment a camera assembly is disclosed. The camera assembly comprises a flash an image sensor and a combined lens . The camera assembly also comprises a housing for housing the flash the image sensor and the lens such that the flash portion of the lens is aligned with the flash and the image sensor portion of the lens is aligned with the image sensor. For example the lens can be secured to the interior or exterior of the housing adhesive snaps or other methods of attachment. Similarly the flash and image sensor can be secured within the housing. The housing can have one or more openings where the lens is secured such that light can pass through the lens and into the image sensor or out of the flash . Together the lens flash and image sensor can form an operable camera housed in the housing.
