The present disclosure claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 483 295 filed on May 6 2011 and to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 591 616 filed on Jan. 27 2012 the entire contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference.

Cloud computing refers to provision of computational resources via a computer network. In a traditional model of computing both data and software are fully contained on a user s computer. In cloud computing however the user s computer may contain relatively little software or data perhaps a minimal operating system and web browser for example and may serve as a display terminal for processes occurring on a network of computers. A common shorthand provided for a cloud computing service or system or even an aggregation of existing cloud services is the cloud. 

Cloud computing has been referred to as client server computing however there may be distinctions between general cloud computing and client server computing. For example client server computing may include a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between providers of a resource or service e.g. servers and service requesters e.g. clients . Client server computing generally involves a one to one relationship between the server and the client whereas cloud computing includes generic services that can be accessed by generic clients e.g. a one to one relationship or connection may not be required . Thus cloud computing generally includes client server computing and additional services and functionality.

Cloud computing may free users from certain hardware and software installation and maintenance tasks through use of simpler hardware on the user s computer that accesses a vast network of computing resources e.g. processors hard drives etc. . Sharing of resources may reduce cost to individuals. Thus any computer connected to the cloud may be connected to the same pool of computing power applications and files. Users can store and access personal files such as music pictures videos and bookmarks or play games or use productivity applications on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium such as a DVD or thumb drive.

In one example a user may open a browser and connect to a host of web servers that run user interface software that collect commands from the user and interpret the commands into commands on the servers. The servers may handle the computing and can either store or retrieve information from database servers or file servers and display an updated page to the user. Through cloud computing data across multiple servers can be synchronized around the world allowing for collaborative work on one file or project from multiple users around the world for example.

In one example a method is provided comprising receiving at the robotic device a plurality of commands and each command of the plurality of commands is associated with a time of execution. The method may also comprise determining for each of the plurality of commands at least one constraint of a plurality of constraints for the robotic device. The method may further comprise for each command determining the time of execution based on a satisfaction of the at least one constraint of the plurality of constraints associated with the respective command. The method may also comprise determining a prioritization of execution of the plurality of commands based on the plurality of times of execution and based on an environment where the respective commands are to be executed and executing by the robotic device at least one command of the plurality of commands based on the prioritization of execution.

In another example a computer readable medium having stored therein instructions executable by a robotic device that includes at least one sensory device to cause the robotic device to perform functions is provided. The functions may comprise receiving at the robotic device a plurality of commands and each command of the plurality of commands is associated with a time of execution. The functions may also comprise determining for each of the plurality of commands at least one constraint of a plurality of constraints for the robotic device. The functions may further comprises for each command determining the time of execution based on a satisfaction of the at least one constraint of the plurality of constraints associated with the respective command and executing by the robotic device at least one command of the plurality of commands based on the plurality of times of execution.

In another example a robotic device is provided that comprises one or more processors at least one sensor coupled to the one or more processors and configured to capture data about an environment in a vicinity of the at least one sensor and memory including instructions stored thereon executable by the one or more processors to perform functions. The functions may comprise receiving at the robotic device a plurality of commands wherein each command of the plurality of commands is associated with a time of execution. The functions may also comprise determining for each of the plurality of commands at least one constraint of a plurality of constraints for the robotic device. The functions may further comprise for each command determining the time of execution based on a satisfaction of the at least one constraint of the plurality of constraints associated with the respective command and executing by the robotic device at least one command of the plurality of commands based on the plurality of times of execution.

Any of the methods described herein may be provided in a form of instructions stored on a non transitory computer readable medium that when executed by a computing device cause the computing device to perform functions of the method. Further examples may also include articles of manufacture including tangible computer readable media that have computer readable instructions encoded thereon and the instructions may comprise instructions to perform functions of the methods described herein.

The computer readable medium may include non transitory computer readable medium for example such as computer readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory processor cache and Random Access Memory RAM . The computer readable medium may also include non transitory media such as secondary or persistent long term storage like read only memory ROM optical or magnetic disks compact disc read only memory CD ROM for example. The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium for example or a tangible storage medium.

In addition circuitry may be provided that is wired to perform logical functions in any processes or methods described herein.

In still further examples any type of devices may be used or configured to perform logical functions in any processes or methods described herein.

In yet further examples any type of devices may be used or configured as means for performing functions of any of the methods described herein or any portions of the methods described herein .

The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects embodiments and features described above further aspects embodiments and features will become apparent by reference to the Figures and the following Detailed Description.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying Figures which form a part hereof. In the Figures similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description Figures and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure as generally described herein and illustrated in the Figures can be arranged substituted combined separated and designed in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.

This disclosure includes inter alia methods and systems for robot and user interaction over the cloud. Within examples cloud based computing generally refers to networked computer architectures in which application execution and storage may be divided to some extent between client and server devices. A robot may be any device that has a computing ability and interacts with its surroundings with an actuation capability e.g. electromechanical capabilities . A client device may be configured as a robot including various sensors and devices in the forms of modules and different modules may be added or removed from robot depending on requirements. In some examples a robot may be configured to receive a second device such as mobile phone that may be configured to function as an accessory or a brain of the robot.

In examples described herein a robot may interact with the cloud to perform any number of actions such as to share information with other cloud computing devices. Within examples a robot may interact with a user in a manner that is based upon many types of received information. A robot may access a user device to determine or identify information about a user or related to the user and the robot may be configured to tailor a method of interaction with the user based on the identified information. A robot may further receive data associated with the user to identify the user such as using speech or face recognition. The robot may provide a personalized interaction or response to the user based on the determined information of the user.

In some examples a robot may be asked commanded to perform one or more functions each of which may have certain constraints associated with that function. Commands may therefore conflict as in the context of the constraints. Based upon an existing hierarchical ontology drawn from memory or from a local or cloud based informational resource the robot may be able to alter the order of lower level tasks required to perform a command to stay within the constraints. But if a first command function e.g. an output function such as a task cannot be completed within one or more constraints which may be imposed by another or second function which the robot is commanded to do at the same time or time frame with the first function the robot may then determine or prioritize which constraint s to relax or put another way determine which of the conflicting commands to suspend in favor of executing another command. That suspension of one command may be for a period of time or indefinitely. The robot may reevaluate a suspended command over time for a determination of whether the conflict no longer exists or that the suspended command should then be executed with suspension of further execution of the other command based upon sensory data obtained over time.

As an example if the robot is asked to clean the floor as a first command and to stay quiet when guests are in the vicinity of the robot as a second command then the robot may temporarily stop cleaning the floor in the presence of guests. However if the robot senses that the guests are lingering too long in its vicinity then the robot may determine that it is now more important to clean the floor rather than stay quiet and resume cleaning the floor.

In some examples a robot may be capable of systematically processing commands as from a user and autonomously responding to situations where the commands are not prioritized or more particularly where the commands are potentially in conflict. Example systems and methods may obtain relational data from an informational resource such as the cloud for use in processing or determining which restraints associated with conflicting commands to relax in order to execute at least one of the command functions. The relational data may comprise previously established classes hierarchies or rules of lower level stages or steps involved in a higher level task and responses to those stages or steps.

The cloud processing may further include filtering to refine the relational data in the situational contextual environment sensed by the robot and the use of a higher level of rules such as weighting or harm benefit analyses from which the robot then performs reasoning or determinations regarding a command prioritization of the conflicting commands. The robot may have the sensory ability to update the command prioritization dynamically taking into consideration changed aspects of the environment where the commands are to be executed. Furthermore the robot may have the ability to extrapolate to likely conclusions which may result as a consequence of selecting one command over another and over time to reevaluate the choice of commands. That extrapolation may include determining event outcomes as by running simulations with changing variables which may be performed in the cloud and results of the simulations may be provided to the robot. The robot may then factor an action based upon a chosen event outcome for a desired consequence.

Referring now to the Figures is an example system for cloud based computing. Cloud based computing generally refers to networked computer architectures in which application execution and storage may be divided to some extent between client and server devices. A cloud may refer to a service or group of services accessible over a network e.g. Internet by client and server devices for example.

In one example any computer connected to the cloud may be connected to the same pool of computing power applications and files. Thus cloud computing enables a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services that can be provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Users can store and access personal files such as music pictures videos and bookmarks or play games or use productivity applications on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium.

As an example in contrast to a predominately client based or server based application a cloud based application may store copies of data and or executable program logic at remote server devices while allowing client devices to download at least some of this data and program logic as needed for execution at the client devices. In some examples downloaded data and program logic can be tailored to capabilities of specific client devices e.g. a personal computer tablet or mobile phone or robot accessing the cloud based application. In addition dividing application execution and storage between the client and server devices allows more processing to be performed by the server devices taking advantage of server devices processing power and capability for example.

Cloud based computing can also refer to distributed computing architectures in which data and program logic for a cloud based application are shared between one or more client devices and or server devices on a near real time basis. Parts of this data and program logic may be dynamically delivered as needed or otherwise to various clients accessing the cloud based application. Details of the architecture may be transparent to users of client devices. Thus a PC user or robot client device accessing a cloud based application may not be aware that the PC or robot downloads program logic and or data from the server devices or that the PC or robot offloads processing or storage functions to the server devices for example.

In a cloud includes a cloud service a cloud platform a cloud infrastructure and a database . The cloud may include more of fewer components and each of the cloud service the cloud platform the cloud infrastructure and the database may comprise multiple elements as well. Thus one or more of the described functions of the system may be divided up into additional functional or physical components or combined into fewer functional or physical components. In some further examples additional functional and or physical components may be added to the examples illustrated by . Delivery of cloud computing may involve multiple cloud components communicating with each other over application programming interfaces such as web services and three tier architectures for example.

The cloud may represent a networked computer architecture and in one example the cloud service represents a queue for handling requests from client devices. The cloud platform may include a frontend of the cloud and may be coupled to the cloud service to perform functions to interact with client devices. The cloud platform may include applications used to access the cloud via a user interface such as a web browser. The cloud infrastructure may include service application of billing components of the cloud and thus may interact with the cloud service . The database may represent storage capabilities by the cloud and thus may be accessed by any of the cloud service the cloud platform and or the infrastructure .

The example system includes a number of client devices coupled to or configured to be capable of communicating with components of the cloud . For example a computer a mobile device a host and a robot client are shown coupled to the cloud . Of course more or fewer client devices may be coupled to the cloud . In addition different types of client devices may be coupled to the cloud . For example any of the client devices may generally comprise a display system memory and a processor.

The computer may be any type of computing device e.g. PC laptop computer and the mobile device may be any type of mobile computing device e.g. laptop mobile telephone cellular telephone .

The host may be any type of computing device or transmitter including a laptop computer a mobile telephone that is configured to transmit data to the cloud .

The robot client may comprise any computing device that has connection abilities to the cloud and that has an actuation capability e.g. electromechanical capabilities . A robot may further be a combination of computing devices. In some examples the robot may collect data and upload the data to the cloud . The cloud may be configured to perform calculations or analysis on the data and return processed data to the robot client . In some examples as shown in the cloud may include a computer that is not co located with the robot client . In other examples the robot client may send data to a second client e.g. computer for processing.

Any of the client devices may include additional components. For example the robot client may include one or more sensors such as a gyroscope or an accelerometer to measure movement of the robot client . Other sensors may further include any of Global Positioning System GPS receivers infrared sensors optical sensors still image or motion picture biosensors Radio Frequency identification RFID systems RADAR wireless sensors haptic arrays and other touch sensors and or compasses among others for example.

In addition any of the client devices may include an integrated user interface UI that allows a user to interact with the device. For example the robot client may include various buttons and or a touchscreen interface that allow a user to provide input. As another example the robot client device may include a microphone configured to receive voice commands from a user. Furthermore the robot client may include one or more interfaces that allow various types of user interface devices to be connected to the robot client .

In communication links between client devices and the cloud may include wired connections such as a serial or parallel bus. Communication links may also be wireless links such as link which may include Bluetooth IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.11 may refer to IEEE 802.11 2007 IEEE 802.11n 2009 or any other IEEE 802.11 revision or other wireless based communication links.

In other examples the system may include access points through which the client devices may communicate with the cloud . Access points may take various forms for example an access point may take the form of a wireless access point WAP or wireless router. As another example if a client device connects using a cellular air interface protocol such as a CDMA or GSM protocol an access point may be a base station in a cellular network that provides Internet connectivity via the cellular network.

As such the client devices may include a wired or wireless network interface through which the client devices can connect to the cloud or access points . As an example the client devices may be configured use one or more protocols such as 802.11 802.16 WiMAX LTE GSM GPRS CDMA EV DO and or HSPDA among others. Furthermore the client devices may be configured use multiple wired and or wireless protocols such as 3G or 4G data connectivity using a cellular communication protocol e.g. CDMA GSM or WiMAX as well as for WiFi connectivity using 802.11 . Other examples are also possible.

In one example the storage may be used for compiling data from various sensors of the robot and storing program instructions. The processor may be coupled to the storage and may be configured to control the robot based on the program instructions. The processor may also be able to interpret data from the various sensors on the robot as discussed above.

The client device may also have components or devices that allow the client device to interact with its environment. For example the client device may have mechanical actuators such as motors wheels movable arms that enable the client device to move or interact with the environment.

In some examples various sensors and devices on the client device may be modules. Different modules may be added or removed from a client device depending on requirements. For example in a low power situation a robot may have fewer modules to reduce power usages. However additional sensors may be added as needed. To increase an amount of data a robot may be able to collect additional sensors may be added for example.

In some examples the client device may be configured to receive a device such as device that includes the processor the storage and the sensors . For example the client device may be a robot that has a number of mechanical actuators e.g. a movable base and the robot may be configured to receive a mobile telephone to function as the brains or control components of the robot. The device may be considered a module of the robot. The device may be physically attached to the robot. For example a mobile phone may sit on a robot s chest and form an interactive display. The device may provide a robot with sensors a wireless link and processing capabilities for example. The device may allow a user to download new routines for his or her robot from the cloud. For example a laundry folding routine may be stored on the cloud and a user may be able to select this routine using a mobile phone to download the routine from the cloud and when the mobile phone is placed into or coupled to the robot the robot would be able to perform the downloaded action.

In some examples the client device may be coupled to a mobile or cellular telephone to provide additional sensing capabilities. The cellular phone may not be physically attached to the robot but may be coupled to the robot wirelessly. For example a low cost robot may omit a direct connection to the Internet. This robot may be able to connect to a user s cellular phone via a wireless technology e.g. Bluetooth to be able to access the internet. The robot may be able to access various sensors and communication means of the cellular phone. The robot may not need as many sensors to be physically provided on the robot however the robot may be able to keep the same or similar functionality.

Thus the client device may include mechanical robot features and may be configured to receive the device e.g. a mobile phone which can provide additional peripheral components to the device such as any of an accelerometer gyroscope compass GPS camera WiFi connection a touch screen that are included within the device .

In one example the robot may be a toy with only limited mechanical functionality and by connecting device to the robot the toy robot may now be capable of performing a number of functions with the aid of the device and or the cloud. In this manner the robot or components of a robot can be attached to a mobile phone to transform the mobile phone into a robot e.g. with legs arms that is connected to a server to cause operation functions of the robot.

The mountable device may further be configured to maximize runtime usage of the robot e.g. if the robot could learn what happens to cause the user to turn the toy off or set the toy down the device may be configured to perform functions to counteract such occurrences .

Any of the robots illustrated in may be configured to operate according to a robot operating system e.g. an operating system designed for specific functions of the robot . A robot operating system may provide libraries and tools e.g. hardware abstraction device drivers visualizers message passing package management to enable robot applications. Examples of robot operating systems include open source software such as ROS robot operating system DROS or ARCOS advanced robotics control operating system proprietary software such as the robotic development platform ESRP from Evolution Robotics and MRDS Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio and other examples also include ROSJAVA. A robot operating system may include publish and subscribe functionality and may also include functionality to control components of the robot such as head tracking base movement e.g. velocity control navigation framework .

As shown any of the modules may be interconnected and or may communicate to receive data or instructions from each other so as to provide a specific output or functionality for the robot.

In one example the robot may send sensory data of object attributes to a cloud for data processing and in another example the robot may receive data back from the cloud based upon processing of that sensory data. The data received from the cloud may be in many different forms. The received data may be a processed form of data the robot sent to the cloud. The received data may also come from sources other than the robot. For example the cloud may have access to other sensors other robots and the Internet.

The cloud may receive input from several robots. Data from each robot may be compiled into a larger data set. For example the robot may take a picture of a clothing object image and upload the image to the cloud . An object recognition program in the cloud may be configured to identify the object in the image and provide data to all the robots connected to the cloud about the recognized clothing as well as possibly about other characteristics e.g. metadata of the recognized object such as a location size weight color. Thus every robot may be able to know attributes of an object in an image uploaded by the robot .

The robots and may perform any number of actions with an area people or other robots. In one example each robot and has WiFi or other network based connectivity and will upload publish data to the cloud that can then be shared with any other robot. In this manner each robot and shares experiences with each other to enable learned behaviors. Robot makes an assessment or determination based upon the observed object and or user which is then shared with the other robots and through the cloud . Each robot and will have access to real time up to date data. One or more of these other robots may then proceed to perform some further function such as picking up the object and performing a task with the object. In another example the robot can download data indicating images seen by the other robots and to help the robot better identify an object using various views e.g. in instances in which the robots and have captured images of the objects from a different perspective .

In still another example the robot may build a map of an area and the robot can download the map to have knowledge of the area. Similarly the robot could update the map created by the robot with new information about the area e.g. the hallway now has boxes or other obstacles or with new information collected from sensors that the robot may not have had e.g. the robot may be an outdoor robot and may record and add temperature data to the map if the robot did not have a temperature sensor . Overall the robots and may be configured to share data that is collected to enable faster adaptation such that each robot and can build upon a learned experience of a previous robot.

Sharing and adaptation capabilities enable a variety of applications based on a variety of inputs data received from the robots and . In a specific example data regarding a history of an output performed based upon some action taken by the robot e.g. feedback on the action can be provided to a new robot interacting with that type of situation or scenario in the future.

In one example the cloud may include store or provide access to a database of information related to objects and the database may be accessible by all the robots and . The database may include information identifying objects that may be identical or similar and details of the kinds of object e.g. mass properties shape use cost any detail that may be associated with the object that can be accessed by the robots and to perform object recognition and then interaction with the object.

The database may be accessible by all robots through the cloud or alternatively directly accessible by all robots without communication through the cloud . The database may thus be a shared knowledge base stored in the cloud .

Thus in some examples robots may share new or learned behaviors through the cloud . The cloud may have a server that stores robot learned activities or behaviors resulting in a shared knowledge base of behaviors and heuristics for object interactions e.g. a robot app store . Specifically a given robot may perform actions and build a compendium related to an article of clothing and then the robot can upload the data to the cloud to share this knowledge with all other robots. In this example a transportation of the given robot s consciousness can be made through the cloud from one robot to another e.g. robot Bob builds up a map of some clothing and the knowledge of Bob can be downloaded onto another robot to receive knowledge of the map .

Thus within examples the robots and may share information through the cloud and may access the database .

As mentioned robots or any client computing device may interact with the cloud and users to perform any number of functions. That includes attempting to respond to a situation or scenario where the robot has received potentially or actually conflicting commands which would otherwise call for simultaneous execution. In some examples a method and system is described whereby the robot may autonomously resolve the conflict as by concluding that one command can take precedence over the other i.e. relaxing one or more constraints that would otherwise dictate the robot s response to a command. Example functions are described below.

Method may include one or more operations functions or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks . Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order these blocks may also be performed in parallel and or in a different order than those described herein unless dictated by a necessary earlier step. Also the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks divided into additional blocks and or removed based upon the desired implementation.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein the flowchart shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present embodiments. In this regard each block may represent a module a segment or a portion of program code which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. The program code may be stored on any type of computer readable medium for example such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive. The computer readable medium may include non transitory computer readable medium for example such as computer readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory processor cache and Random Access Memory RAM . The computer readable medium may also include non transitory media such as secondary or persistent long term storage like read only memory ROM optical or magnetic disks compact disc read only memory CD ROM for example. The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium for example or a tangible storage device.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein each block in may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in the process.

At block the method includes capture an image of an object. In an example a robot may capture many images of objects using any number of sensors such as a camera still pictures or video feeds infrared projectors and other sensors as discussed herein.

At block the method includes capture information associated with characteristics about the object. For example a robot may optionally determine or record dimensions a texture color pattern material hardness condition or any type of physical attribute of the object.

As another example in an instance in which the robot may communicate with the object the robot may capture additional data of the object such as by accessing a magnetic strip RFID near field communication clip bar code of the item. The robot may thereby communicate with the item to determine many types of data.

At block the method includes query a computing device with the captured image and or information. As an example the robot may query the cloud with a captured image by sending the captured image to the cloud and requesting information about the image such as an identity of the image or information associated with characteristics of the object in the image. Alternatively the robot may query another robot directly to request information about the object such as an image of an alternate view of the object.

At block the method includes receiving information or retrieving information associated with the object. For example the robot may receive data from the cloud indicating an identity of the object in the image or other information related to or associated with characteristics about the object.

At block the method includes storing the received information for future recognitions. For example after receiving the information from the cloud the robot would be able to recognize the clothing in the future enabling the robot to learn and adapt. Storing is an optional step.

At block the method includes performing an action based on the received information. The action may vary based on a type of received information or the query that is presented by the robot. As an example the robot may query the cloud to identify the object and details of the object to enable the robot to interact with the object as well as a potential user of the object.

In a similar manner the lower level classification reasoning then involves obtaining relational information to the object classification of floor. At block this may include sensory input from the environment of the robot as to what floor is involved i.e. using the object recognition method of . This lower level classification may thus further include a determination of which of several floors may be actually specified or intended. Here again environmental and user data may be accessed for the determination of which floor for instance the user may have just entered the vicinity of the robot from working in the garden outdoors and deposited dirt on the adjacent floor. The robot may thus use this sensory input to conclude that the newly dirtied floor is intended to be the subject of clean. 

Once the lower level classification is determined what floor and relational information on clean has been determined the command is then subject to analysis using an action interpreter as at block . Action interpretation formulates the appropriate or most likely action to execute. This may include processing again using the cloud. A task sequencer program shown at block could then be engaged to execute an output function for performing the task steps sequentially of cleaning the selected floor.

Higher level reasoning then involves obtaining relational information as to the pertinent task steps necessary to effect cleaning including when to execute block . This may be a subroutine from past cleaning experiences which may be resident in the robot s memory or drawn from some other relational resource which could be another robot for instance a database or the cloud . In a like manner higher level reasoning involves obtaining relational information for pertinent task steps necessary for walking including when to execute block . For instance the robot may obtain electronic data from a user device as to where the walking is to take place and when walking is typically effected.

In a similar manner the lower level classification reasoning then involves obtaining relational information to the object classification of dog. This may include sensory input from the environment of the robot as to what dog is involved i.e. using the object recognition method of .

The robot has now been given two conflicting commands for example the robot cannot execute an output function of cleaning the room while at the same time walking the dog. Identified constraints include for instance a time frame within which the floor must should can be cleaned cleaning time frame and a time frame within which the dog must should can be walked walking time frame . A further constraint may be that there may be harm to the dog and or the floor if the dog is not walked within the walking time frame. Similarly a further constraint may be that the floor may be harmed if the dirt is allowed to remain thereon and get ground into the floor or stain the floor. Still further constraints may include capabilities of the robot such that the robot may not be able to perform certain tasks of a list of tasks to execute the command.

In some examples the robot may determine which of the two or more potentially conflicting commands to execute or to prioritize the execution of the two or a plurality of commands where prioritization is not provided in the command framework. More particularly but without limitation the robot may determine which commands of the two conflicting commands to perform or determine to do none using contextual situational data obtained from the environment of the robotic apparatus and or a user making the determination through processing in a cloud computing system.

Thus the robot may access the informational resource here the cloud although it could be information resident in the robot memory or in a local database for relational information to the commands. For example the robot may determine a time of execution to clean the floor and a time of execution to walk the dog blocks and . Blocks and may be performed substantially simultaneously or in sequential order as shown in .

Following the robot may again access the cloud to determine when to execute each of the commands as shown at block . That relational information may be on the nature of the dirt foot traffic conditions dwell time for staining and a typically acceptable time frame within which cleaning takes place. That relational information may also be previous times when the dog has been walked how long a walk takes and what kind of latitude there may be in starting a walk sequence i.e. can that be ten minutes half an hour an hour of a usual walk time .

In this example the robot determines that the current time of day is 10 00 a.m. A typical period for walking the dog does not occur until 11 00 a.m. The robot determines that the floor can be cleaned in less than an hour. The robot may then determine to relax the constraints on walking the dog by suspending that command block while the robot then executes the floor cleaning output function. Floor cleaning has thus been prioritized over walking the dog.

Thus the robot may determine the plurality of times of execution and compare with the conflict between a first constraint and a second constraint of a plurality of constraints. The robot may receive any number of commands and each command may include a constraint e.g. a first constraint associated with a first command of the plurality of commands e.g. clean the floor this morning and a second constraint associated with a second command of the plurality of commands e.g. be quiet in the presence of guests . The robot then determines a first time of execution for the first command and a second time of execution for the second command e.g. begin cleaning the floor now cease movement now in view of guests in the room of the floor . The robot can be configured to further determine whether delaying execution of the first command resolves the conflict and in response to determining that delaying execution of the first command resolves the conflict suspend cleaning of the floor changing the first time of execution engage sensory devices over time to monitor whether guests remain in the room .

Modifying the foregoing example slightly the robot may determine through sensory data that the dog has begun to whine and scratch at the door to the yard outside. Again accessing an informational resource as at block the robot determines that the dog is in distress as indicated by the dog s conduct. The robot therefore determines that the walk dog command which might have been suspendible should now be executed and the clean floor command can be suspended block . The system and method of the foregoing embodiment may further provide for the methodology additionally including obtaining environmental sensory input data over time and reevaluating whether the other of the first or said second output functions which was suspended may then be executed.

In some examples the robot may assess a first benefit associated with performing a first command of the plurality of commands and assess a second benefit associated with performing a second command of the plurality of commands. Based upon these assessments the robot can then determine whether the second benefit exceeds the first benefit and if so set the time of execution for the first command to a suspended state. The foregoing method and system may further include obtaining sensory input data over time via at least one sensory device of the robotic system during the suspended state of the first command and in response to the sensory input data determining whether the first constraint is no longer in conflict and if not executing the first command.

In further examples the system and method described herein may provide that any command that would result in an output function causing harm to a user is indefinitely suspended. Furthermore any command that would result in an output function causing harm to the robotic device may be indefinitely suspended unless harm would result to a user by suspension. This system and method may further provide executing a command that would cause the least harm to a user.

In other examples the robotic device may be configured to determine which command of a number of commands to execute based on an environmental analysis and response capability. A robot includes a computer processor memory and operating system with at least one sensory device capturing data relating to environmental conditions in the vicinity of the robot or a user for an environmental input. An electronic data capture device can also be provided for the robot. That data capture may be concerning a user in the vicinity of the robot to thereby obtain user data input. This user data input is then applied in the processing step to obtain information regarding a state of the user or some other information regarding the user. Obtaining user data input may preferably include a first device associated with the robot obtaining user data from a second device wherein the user data relates to communication between a user and the second device containing user data. The second device may be one or more of a personal computer a mobile telephone a tablet computer and a landline telephone.

As indicated in some examples the methodology of the application may be a higher level service e.g. higher in a software stack such that details and specifics for how to proceed may be performed by the cloud. As an example using the object recognition application of the robot may execute software to perform immediate function calls such as OrientObject which may return information associated with an object e.g. placing it right side up or RotateObject which may cause the robot to pick up the object and obtain further views sensory inputs. These immediate functions could be done through local processing within the robot or by enabling function calls and operation through the cloud which may facilitate control and operation of the robot without having to control or tie up more limited computational capacities of the robot for example.

The actions or functions of the system and method of may be performed by the robot a local computational resource or the cloud or components of the cloud in a distributed manner.
