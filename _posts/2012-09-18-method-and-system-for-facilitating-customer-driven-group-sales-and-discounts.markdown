In the discussion above certain aspects of one embodiment include process steps and or operations and or instructions described herein for illustrative purposes in a particular order and or grouping. However the particular order and or grouping shown and discussed herein are illustrative only and not limiting. Those of skill in the art will recognize that other orders and or grouping of the process steps and or operations and or instructions are possible and in some embodiments one or more of the process steps and or operations and or instructions discussed above can be combined and or deleted. In addition portions of one or more of the process steps and or operations and or instructions can be re grouped as portions of one or more other of the process steps and or operations and or instructions discussed herein. Consequently the particular order and or grouping of the process steps and or operations and or instructions discussed herein do not limit the scope of the invention as claimed below.

Using process for facilitating customer driven group sales and discounts discussed above an individual e.g. a single potential purchaser of a product or service is provided an effective efficient and simple mechanism for identifying and creating group interest in the purchase of the product or service e.g. for identifying and collecting a group of potential customers of the product or service. Then using process for facilitating customer driven group sales and discounts the existence of the group of potential customers of a product or service can easily efficiently and effectively be leveraged to solicit extract a group purchase discount offer from one or more providers of the product or service. Consequently using process for facilitating customer driven group sales and discounts individuals can obtain group pricing benefits typically only made available to wholesale and lot purchasers such as wholesale purchasers and retail stores.

In addition through process for facilitating customer driven group sales and discounts providers of product and services are provided the opportunity to increase their sales volume and to essentially utilize individuals as marketing and advertising agents. Consequently both individual consumers of products and services and providers of the products and services are benefited by the implementation of process for facilitating customer driven group sales and discounts.
