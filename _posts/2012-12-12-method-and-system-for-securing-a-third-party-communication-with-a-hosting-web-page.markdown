This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 610 826 filed Nov. 2 2009 which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 61 193 169 filed on Nov. 3 2008 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

Web browsers are increasingly becoming a single stop resource for computing needs including information access personal communications e commerce and much more. Consequently web pages are designed to combine data and functionality from two or more external sources to create a new service. In the related art such web pages are known as mashup pages. 

The mashup technology allows integrating data and functionality into a web page using one or more open application programming interfaces APIs . A prime example of a mashup web page is an online advertisement hosted within a page typically in a form of a banner. The banner generally promotes a specific vendible product and when it is clicked upon the user is linked for example to the advertiser s site where more detailed information is provided about the products or services. An online advertisement is typically displayed as a combination of text audio still images animation video and interactivity content forms. Different content types may be different objects of a rich media advertisement. Rich media content can be downloadable or may be embedded in a webpage and can be viewed using a media player. The media player may be a plug in or an offline application. An example for a rich media format and player is Flash provided by Adobe .

The mashup web page is typically referred to as a hosting web page and the external objects as third party modules. The drawback of the mashup architecture is that the hosting web page is vulnerable to attacks from third party modules as these modules have a full access to APIs of the hosting web page. In the related art solutions to a secure hosting web page include for example browser abstractions. The web browser abstractions facilitate resource management and an access control. The browser abstractions are implemented using dedicated HTML tags e.g. and a script proxy provided as an extension of a web browser.

The disadvantage of this approach is that APIs of hosting pages are still exposed to malicious third party modules. In addition in order to secure hosting web pages a web browser installed in each client should be updated to include the script proxy. In today s environment where different vendors provide their web version the security approach of web browser abstractions is not feasible.

Therefore it would be advantageous to provide an efficient solution for securing web pages hosting third party modules.

Certain embodiments disclosed herein include a computer system configured to generate a secure agent for securing a hosting web page from a malicious at least one third party module. The secure agent comprises a sand box proxy for proxying between the at least one third party module and the hosting web page and a sand box engine for executing a validated script of the at least one third party module over the hosting web page.

Certain embodiments disclosed herein also include a publisher server comprises a network interface for communicating with a plurality of vendor servers for receiving third party modules a processor a memory coupled to the processor and configured to store at least instructions that when executed by the processor cause the publisher server to render hosting web pages wherein each of the rendered hosting web pages includes at least one of the received third party modules that is being denied from a direct access to application programming interfaces APIs of the hosting web page.

The embodiments disclosed by the invention are only examples of the many possible advantageous uses and implementations of the innovative teachings presented herein. In general statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily limit any of the various claimed inventions. Moreover some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others. In general unless otherwise indicated singular elements may be in plural and vice versa with no loss of generality. In the drawings like numerals refer to like parts through several views.

The publisher server is connected to the network and is capable of embedding third party modules in hosting web pages downloaded from servers and further uploading the web pages with the third party modules to clients web browsers. The third party modules are downloaded from one or more servers belonging to one or more third party vendors. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention third party modules are online advertisements and the vendors are advertisement agencies. In accordance with the principles of the invention all third party modules embedded in a hosting web page by the publisher server cannot directly access APIs of the hosting web page.

A non limiting and exemplary diagram of a hosting web page constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is shown in . The hosting web page includes a sand box proxy and a sand box engine that together provide a security protection layer for the page . The sand box proxy and sand box engine block a third party module from directly executing any actions on the hosting web page . With this aim the sand box proxy dynamically loads the third party module to the hosting web page and once uploaded the module cannot directly call or access the hosting web page using an API exposed by the page . Rather the third party module can communicate only with sand box proxy through a predefined API hereinafter the proxy API exposed by the proxy . The proxy API includes at least a payload parameter encapsulating an executable script. This script is typically a process being executed by the sand box engine to run over the hosting web page . It should be noted that a typical architecture of a hosting web page mashup page does not include the sand box proxy and engine . Thus according to the principles of certain embodiments of the invention the third party module can be blocked from running a harmful script over the hosting web page .

The sand box proxy receives the proxy API call and determines if the call is potentially harmful using a set of validation rules. For example if the third party module tries to access a restricted network resource. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention only validated proxy API calls are sent to the sand box engine . The sand box proxy generates a new API call hereinafter the engine API which it can communicate with the sand box engine . The engine API has a predefined format having an API method name and parameters. The payload portion includes the proxy API i.e. the script to be executed.

The sand box engine performs a set of checks to determine if the script included in the payload of the engine API is potentially harmful. Validated scripts are safe for execution. It should be appreciated that the sand box proxy and engine control all communication from the third party module to the hosting web page thereby providing a sealed and safe environment for the page .

In certain implementations if the hosting web page includes more than one third party module a single sand box proxy handles API calls from a single third party module . The sand box engine validates and executes all API calls received from all sand box proxies .

The sand box proxy sand box engine and third party module may be implemented as executable code e.g. a Flash swf file temporary stored in a readable medium in the client and are executed thereon. The client maybe any computing device including at least a processor and a computer readable medium. In certain embodiments the sand box engine and one or more sand box proxies can be implemented as part of a secure agent.

At S a third party module is uploaded to a hosting web page by the sand box proxy. Thereafter the sand box proxy and the third party module can communicate with each other using a proxy API exposed by the sand box proxy . The format of the proxy API may be predefined and includes at least an API name and API s parameters. As a non limiting example the proxy API may be 

ExecuteScript is an API s name of a public method that the proxy exposes to the third party module. The third party module calls this method when there is a need to communicate with the hosting web page. Other examples for public methods may be resizeBrowserWindow ShakeBrowserWindow and the like. The Payload and isRunSync are the API s parameters. The Payload is a string that includes a script that the proxy should delegate to the engine . The script could be a single function call or a block of inline script that the engine is required to execute once validated. The isRunSync is a Boolean parameter true false that indicates whether the script should be executed by the engine in a sequential or parallel mode. The engine can handle engine API calls received from one or proxies either in a parallel or in a sequential manner. The calls are processed in the order determined by the isRunSync parameter.

At S a proxy API call sent by the third party module is received at the sand box proxy . At S the content of the received API proxy s payload is validated by the sand box proxy in order to detect malicious operations. This step is performed using one or more validation rules selected from a predefined set of rules. A non limiting example for a validation rule is a check performed to determine if a third party module tries to read private information e.g. a credit card number from the hosting web page. Another example is a rule that scans for invalid third party network addresses through which the module can transfer information to malicious third party servers. Another example is a rule that checks for malicious code e.g. a virus or a Trojan horse in the script included in the payload parameter. This rule blocks attackers from breaching the sand box environment and bypassing the proxy . A person with ordinary skill in the art can easily define a new set of validation rules based on the above teachings.

If the proxy API is valid execution continues with S otherwise at S the proxy API is blocked i.e. the API call is not relayed to the engine . In accordance with another embodiment the script in proxy API s payload can be modified to correct security breaches. For example a DOM of the hosting page can be restricted to a write only option in order to prevent reading of private information. As another example any access to unknown servers addresses can be blocked.

At S an engine API is generated by the sand box proxy by including at least the proxy API s payload in the engine API s parameters. The engine API may be formatted as described above. Once ready the engine API is sent at S to the sand box engine where the validity of the API call is being checked S . Specifically the engine checks the received API using one or more rules selected from a predefined set of rules. One rule includes verification of the source of the engine API i.e. if this API call originated from a known sand box proxy . The rules described in detail above can also be utilized by the sand box engine . If the engine API is determined to be valid execution continues with S where the payload s content or script is executed by the sand box engine otherwise at S the engine API is discarded.

The principles of the invention can be implemented as hardware firmware software or any combination thereof. Moreover the software is preferably implemented as an application program tangibly embodied on a program storage unit computer readable medium or machine readable medium. One of ordinary skilled in the art would recognize that a machine readable medium is a medium capable of storing data and can be in a form of a digital circuit an analogy circuit or combination thereof. The application program may be uploaded to and executed by a machine comprising any suitable architecture. Preferably the machine is implemented on a computer platform having hardware such as one or more central processing units CPUs a memory and input output interfaces. The computer platform may also include an operating system and microinstruction code. The various processes and functions described herein may be either part of the microinstruction code or part of the application program or any combination thereof which may be executed by a CPU whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown. In addition various other peripheral units may be connected to the computer platform such as an additional data storage unit and a printing unit.
