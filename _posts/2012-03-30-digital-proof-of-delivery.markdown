Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to methods and systems for facilitating e commerce and more particularly for enabling merchants to provide proof of delivery of digital goods items for preventing or reducing fraud.

In today s media market it is not at all uncommon to sell and deliver digital content such as files software art photographs music and movies through a number of electronic sources. This is usually referred to as digital e commerce or digital download delivery. Digital goods is a general term that may be used in e commerce to refer to any goods that are stored delivered or used electronically and may be used in a variety of industries such as gaming online content and premium video. Examples of digital goods include e books music files games video news articles media content software digital images website templates manuals in electronic format or any item which can be electronically stored in a file or multiple files. People also purchase digital goods in all sorts of online applications ranging from social networking apps applications and games to massively multiplayer online games. Some of the most popular items of these digital goods include virtual goods such as virtual money and virtual weapons. Free to play games where one can start playing for free and then buy items in the game as one needs them also account for a large amount of virtual goods transactions.

Digital goods may be delivered electronically to the consumer through e mail for example or by download from the Internet. Usually when purchasing digital goods online after the merchant has received payment the merchant may provide the digital goods item as an e mail attachment or may provide the purchaser with a secure link where the purchaser can download the item.

According to one or more embodiments of the present invention methods and systems for digital proof of delivery facilitate authenticating online purchases for helping to prevent and mitigate fraud on purchase of digital goods items. With the aid of one or more embodiments merchants can authenticate the purchase when for example a customer makes a claim for an item not received for digital goods purchase . Additionally third parties may be readily allowed to view the download status of a digital goods item by providing a unique download identification ID of the item. The unique download identification ID of the item also may be useful for aiding third party fraud investigations.

In one or more embodiments a system includes a processor for communication over a network with a customer and a merchant the processor executing a process that provides an intermediary between the customer and the merchant in which in response to an item of digital goods purchased by the customer for download from the merchant having reached a pre determined stage of downloading and the download of the item of digital goods is not complete the processor suspends the download and communicates a dialog box over the network for presentation to the customer and in which in response to a confirmation received via the dialog box the processor completes the download of the item of digital goods and provides a download ID that is unique to the completed download.

In another embodiment a method includes in response to a download over a network of an item of digital goods purchased by a customer for download from a merchant having reached a pre determined stage and the download of the item of digital goods is not complete suspending the download and communicating a dialog box over the network for presentation to the customer and in response to a confirmation received via the dialog box completing the download of the item of digital goods and providing a download ID that is unique to the completed download.

In a further embodiment a computer program product comprises a non transitory computer readable medium having computer readable and executable code for instructing a processor to perform a method that includes in response to a download over a network of an item of digital goods purchased by a customer for download from a merchant having reached a pre determined stage and the download of the item of digital goods is not complete suspending the download and communicating a dialog box over the network for presentation to the customer and in response to a confirmation received via the dialog box completing the download of the item of digital goods and providing a download ID that is unique to the completed download.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to providing solutions to help merchants provide proof of delivery of digital goods items for preventing and reducing fraud. In one embodiment a customer may buy a digital goods item from a merchant website then once the merchant receives payment through for example a payment gateway the merchant may provide a secure connection to deliver the digital goods to the customer from a digital goods store which may be the same or separate from the merchant website . A unique download identification ID is created and associated with the digital goods download and purchase. With this solution merchants can authenticate the purchase when for example a customer files a charge back for an item not received for digital goods purchase . Additionally any third party can view the download status by providing the unique download identification ID which may aid third party fraud investigation.

In one example of an embodiment the parties or entities involved when a customer also referred to as a user of the system or services purchases some digital goods item from a merchant website may include 1 a merchant website 2 a payment gateway and 3 a store that sells digital goods e.g. where the actual digital item resides . The payment gateway may include an online payment service and may be a service provided by a financial service provider FSP such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. in which a user of the service may have an account with the FSP referred to as an FSP account . In one or more embodiments various mechanisms may be provided for sending digital goods including for example using the sender s FSP account and a sender s digital goods locker provided by the FSP using a receiver s digital goods locker provided by the FSP using email or providing for the receiver to receive the digital goods directly from the seller e.g. a merchant or a digital goods store. Once the user customer decides to purchase some digital goods item on the merchant website then the user may be asked to pay the amount specified as the price of the particular digital goods item. The merchant website may establish a secure connection to the payment gateway by which to receive proceeds for the purchase of the digital goods item. The gateway may for example provide a channel for payment from the customer to the merchant or to the store that sells the item. Once the merchant website receives from the payment gateway an indication of payment success then the merchant contacts the store or stores to provide a secure connection e.g. a link for delivering the digital goods to the user. For security the link for the secure connection may for example be available to the user on a time limited basis.

For example merchant website may communicate with FSP in the course of various services offered by FSP to merchant website such as payment intermediary referred to as payment gateway between customers e.g. customer of merchant website and merchant website itself. Similarly a digital goods store may communicate using a server processor over network with any of customer merchant website and FSP each of which also may communicate with digital goods store using network via server . FSP server may execute various application programming interfaces APIs that may enable various different types of relationships between FSP and the different parties shown in . For example merchant website may use an API that allows it to offer sale of goods in which customers are allowed to make payment through FSP while customer may have an account with FSP managed by a different API that allows customer to use the FSP for making payments to sellers that allow use of payment gateway of FSP as a payment intermediary. Also as shown in FSP may provide electronic data storage in the form of database . Database may be used to keep track of user s accounts with FSP merchant s accounts with FSP and transactions between customers merchants and stores including payments between the various entities for example.

At step a user of services provided by FSP such as customer who may have an FSP account with FSP may be shopping online for example at a merchant website of a merchant who sells digital goods. The user may decide whether or not to buy a particular item of digital goods e.g. digital goods and if so the customer user may buy the digital goods item from the merchant website .

At step FSP may provide a service to the user e.g. customer that allows the user to buy the item from the merchant website. For example FSP may provide a mouse click button on the merchant website that allows the user to pay the merchant website from the user s account with the FSP via the payment gateway . The FSP may also provide a service to the merchant website that allows the merchant website to receive payment directly from the FSP on behalf of customer without needing to know any financial information of customer . Once the merchant website receives payment for digital goods through the payment gateway the merchant website may provide a secure connection to deliver digital goods to customer from digital goods store . Digital goods store may be separate from merchant website and merchant website may provide a payment to digital goods store for the digital goods . In other examples digital goods store and merchant website may be commonly owned may be parts of the same entity or may be the same entity.

At step the digital goods may be delivered to customer from digital goods store using the secure connection provided for example by the merchant website . A secure connection may also be provided for example by the FSP . Delivery of the item of digital goods may also include a unique download identification ID that corresponds only to this particular download e.g. the combination of the digital goods item downloaded the IP address to which the item was downloaded the store or merchant that provided the download and the time of the download. For example customer may download the digital goods directly from digital goods store using the secure link provided by merchant website and that particular download occurrence may have a unique ID associated with it that identifies that occurrence and only that occurrence and may be stored e.g. using an electronic data storage device in communication with the processor on which the unique ID is created by digital goods store for future reference by for example digital store FSP customer or other party of interest. In another example merchant website may download the digital goods from the digital goods store using a secure connection then provide the digital goods to the customer over the secure link and keep a record of the unique download ID.

Payment gateway may process the payment request . Examples of processing include checking the customer s account checking the merchant s account transferring payments between accounts and declining payment if funds are not available. Thus payment success may or may not be achieved. If payment success is achieved payment success may be sent to merchant indicating that payment success has been achieved.

Once the merchant receives payment success e.g. a payment success message from the payment gateway then the merchant e.g. web server may create a unique download ID that is unique for each download for example a random number from the user ID and digital goods item ID. For example the unique download ID may be an identifier that uniquely corresponds to the combination of an identification of the digital goods item purchased an identification of the customer an identification of a device to which the digital goods item is download and an identification of the particular instance of downloading the digital goods item. Once the unique download ID has been created and stored the server processor operated by e.g. merchant may trigger the download .

The uniqueness of the download ID for each download may enable providing a proof of delivery for each download for example by allowing each item of downloaded digital goods to be tracked identified and accounted for. Triggering the download may include for example contacting the digital goods store to provide a secure connection e.g. a link for delivering the digital goods to the user. A secure link may be encrypted for example and may be available to the user on a time limited basis. Triggering the download may also include for example providing a mouse click button on the merchant website by which customer can start the download when the customer is ready. At customer start the customer may start the download and at download start the secure download having the unique download ID corresponding to the user ID the digital goods item ID and the particular download itself may begin over the secure connection e.g. link provided by the merchant to the customer .

When download has reached a pre determined stage such as being nearly complete e.g. download nearly complete event web server may initiate a series of events. Download nearly complete event may use any desired threshold for determining that download has reached the pre determined stage e.g. nearly complete. In the example illustrated in download nearly complete event may be triggered when the download is 99.9 complete as shown other criteria for a threshold however could be defined beforehand such as 50 completion of download and the threshold could for example be based on the size e.g. data bytes of the digital goods item or the estimated time to complete at the data rate of the secure link provided by the merchant to the customer .

Download nearly complete event may initiate dialog box in which merchant web server throws e.g. using a java script throw statement a confirmation dialog box to user asking user to confirm the download . The confirmation dialog box can be thrown for example using Java script which may reside in web server and may be monitoring the download . In response to dialog box the user may select OK to proceed for download completion for example by clicking on a confirmation button provided in the confirmation dialog box. If response is a confirmation e.g. OK download completion may proceed. If response is not a confirmation download completion may be aborted.

At confirmation the server may update the download status and IP address against the unique download ID for download for example update database entries keyed to the unique download ID for download in a database kept by merchant website or in database . Also at confirmation the server may trigger an email with the download status and unique download ID to be sent to user . Email may then be sent to user about the user s download request status and the email may provide the unique download ID for future reference by the user. For example the user may wish to check the status of download on the merchant web site . In addition the unique download ID stored at storage may be used by the download provider e.g. merchant website digital goods store or FSP for various purposes such as showing the information to third parties or customers when customers file charge backs e.g. return or refund for guaranteed items .

At step of method a user e.g. customer may start purchasing a digital goods item e.g. digital goods on a merchant website e.g. merchant website .

At step once the payment is successful e.g. a payment success message is received from the FSP the merchant website may create a unique download ID associated with the user customer ID and the digital goods item. This unique download ID may be tied to this item for this user for example by cross referencing in a database into which the unique download ID is stored. The download ID may uniquely correspond for example to a combination of factors such as an identification of the digital goods item purchased an identification of the customer an identification of a device to which the digital goods item is download and an identification of the particular instance e.g. timestamp of downloading the digital goods item

At step as the purchase is a success the user may start downloading the digital goods item from the item provider e.g. merchant website or digital goods store . For example the user may click on a start download button provided on the merchant s webpage.

At step merchant web server e.g. web server may trigger a download request this download request may be tied to the unique download ID for example the download request may correspond to and be cross referenced to the unique download ID at storage . The download request for example may be sent to the digital goods store from merchant website and may contain information sufficient to provide a secure download to customer .

At step when the download reaches a certain stage of completion e.g. progresses to 99.9 the merchant web server may throw a confirmation dialog box to the user asking to confirm the download. The confirmation dialog box can be thrown for example using a java script throw statement java script may reside in the web server e.g. web server web server or web server monitoring the download corresponding to the download request.

At step if the user desires the download to complete the user may select OK in the confirmation dialog box confirming the user s dialog this may be regarded as being similar to the user physically signing a courier receipt after a delivery in the physical world . At step the merchant web server may transfer the remaining bytes and complete the download.

At step the merchant web server may gather the IP address of the download request e.g. IP address of customer and may update a database e.g. merchant s database digital goods store database or FSP database with the status of the download and the IP address cross referenced against the unique download ID.

At step the merchant web server may trigger an email to the user about the user s download request status and provide the unique download ID so that the user can definitively refer to the particular download by its unique download ID. At step for example having the unique download ID for future reference the user can go to the merchant web site and using the definitive reference provided by the unique download ID can check the download status.

At step the merchant can show relevant information e.g. download status to third parties or customers when customers file charge backs. With the unique download ID used as a cross reference for example merchants can authenticate when customers file charge backs e.g. claims for item not received on order for digital goods item . Also in one or more embodiments any third party can view the download status by providing the unique download ID and the unique download ID can be crucial for third party fraud investigation.
