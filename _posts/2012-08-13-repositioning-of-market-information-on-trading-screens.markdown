title: Repositioning of market information on trading screens
abstract: As market conditions descend or ascend an axis of prices, the display of market information is repositioned, at a pre-determined rate if desired, around an item of interest. An item of interest may include the best bid price, the best ask price, the inside market, a moving average, a last traded price, a theoretical value, the result of an equation, or some other item of interest to the trader. According to the present embodiments, market information may be displayed in a region relative to an axis of prices, and when an event occurs, a repositioning signal is initialized causing the axis to be repositioned such that the item of interest is positioned at a pre-determined location in the region. The price axis can be repositioned at a fixed rate or at a dynamically variable rate.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 044 117 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 275 696 which was filed on Mar. 9 2011 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 566 117 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 930 240 which was filed on Sep. 24 2009 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 415 407 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 613 651 which was filed on May 1 2006 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 609 965 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 587 357 which was filed on Jun. 30 2003 the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention is directed towards electronic trading and more specifically is directed to repositioning market information for display on a trading screen and is directed to trading in such a display.

Typically an electronic exchange provides an automatic matching process between traders or more specifically between buyers and sellers. Traders are connected to an electronic exchange by way of a communication link to facilitate electronic messaging between themselves and the exchange. Market information which is included in the messaging is received and displayed to the traders on their trading screens. Upon viewing the market information traders can take certain actions including the action of sending buy or sell orders to the exchange.

In general when a buy order or a sell order is sent to an electronic exchange the exchange s computer logic checks the conditions associated with the order for example price and quantity and determines if a match exists. If a match does not exist the exchange s computer logic prioritizes the order with other orders of the same price in the exchange s electronic order book. When the order conditions are satisfied in the market or equivalently a match exists a trade occurs.

In many instances spotting an opportunity in the market and capitalizing on it before the competition often separates those traders who are successful from those traders who are not. An important component in capitalizing on an opportunity involves the efficient assimilation of market information. Most conventional trading applications receive electronic messaging and attempt to display the market information in some particular fashion to the trader. Until recently however market information was simply displayed on a trading screen in a manner similar to how it was received from the exchange without much customization or formatting. Now developers are beginning to create sophisticated trading screens to interface electronic exchanges. Depending on the actual layout however some trading screens are more successful than others in displaying market information to the traders.

To be a successful trader in electronic markets one must be able to assimilate large amounts of market information and react accordingly more quickly than other competing market participants. It is therefore desirable to improve the way market information is displayed to the trader and to improve the efficiency of order entry by using such displays.

The present embodiments build on the price axis and re centering concepts described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 590 692 entitled Click Based Trading With Intuitive Grid Display of Market Depth filed on Jun. 9 2000 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 971 087 entitled Click Based Trading With Intuitive Grid Display Of Market Depth And Price Consolidation filed on Oct. 5 2001 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 125 894 entitled Trading Tools for Electronic Trading filed on Apr. 19 2002 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 376 417 entitled A System and Method for Trading and Displaying Market Information in an Electronic Trading Environment filed on Feb. 28 2003 the contents of each are incorporated by reference herein.

The way in which market information is displayed to the trader is vital to the success of trading electronically. If the information displayed is confusing or does not provide traders with what they need their performance can degrade. Therefore a trading interface is provided that takes advantage of a computer s graphics capabilities to make the display of market information easier to visualize and analyze. As a result traders can make better visual judgments to detect market trends.

In particular a trader may be interested in a specific item of interest. An item of interest may include the best bid price the best ask price the inside market a moving average a last traded price a theoretical value the result of an equation or some other item of interest to the trader. Then market information may be displayed in a region relative to an axis of prices and upon receiving a repositioning signal the axis is repositioned such that the selected item of interest is centered in the region. Repositioning the price axis also causes the market information to move concurrently.

The repositioning signal may be initialized by an event. An event may include any change in value of the item of interest. For example a trader might select as an item of interest a 10 day moving average of the last traded price. When the 10 day moving average changes from one value to another the signal is initialized causing the price axis to be repositioned. Alternatively an event may include any changes in value of the item of interest where the magnitude of the change falls outside of a particular tolerance level which is defined by one or more limits. Using the 10 day moving average example to illustrate this alternative embodiment assume that the 10 day moving average has to change by 5 price units before the signal is initialized causing the price axis to be repositioned. Of course any number of limits may be set to obtain the appropriate tolerance level s .

In addition the price axis may be repositioned at a particular rate. The rate is the speed at which the price axis is shifted such that the display screen goes from displaying one view of the price axis to another view. It is envisioned that the repositioning may occur at any rate. For example at one end of the spectrum the rate may be instant or near instant and at the other end of the spectrum the rate may be gradual such that the price axis and indicators smoothly glide from one view to another so as not to distract the trader and to avoid errors in order entry if order entry is provided. One or more rates may be chosen by the trader or hard coded which might depend on the options given by the applications software. Also a rate may be dynamically variable or fixed.

The price axis may be repositioned such that the selected item of interest is centered in a region. Of course depending on the granularity of the displayed price scale and the item of interest the item of interest may not always lie directly in the center of the region. Additionally it also envisioned that the price axis may be repositioned in a smooth and continuous fashion so that the item of interest can be directly centered or directly positioned at the desired destination location. This is particularly useful when the item of interest is associated with a price level that can fall between two marked price levels. Also if programmed to do so the item of interest may be positioned in a location different from the center of the region. Because the price axis can be repositioned along the price axis in a smooth and continuous fashion the item of interest can be positioned in an infinite number of locations along the price axis.

One skilled in the art of trading would appreciate the benefits of the present embodiments and could recognize its advantages from the teachings described herein. Some advantages include the efficient market information assimilation by the trader and minimal memory load on the trader. In addition the present embodiments relieve the need to read and interpret strictly alphanumeric data by displaying market information graphically along a price axis while placing particular emphasis on the item of interest. Yet another advantage is that the repositioning rate may be set to a slow enough speed so as not to distract the trader when a repositioning occurs. A slow repositioning rate may augment the assimilation of market information by enhancing the movement of the market according to some item of interest. Moreover the price axis may be repositioned in a continuous manner such that the price axis and indicators smoothly glide from the one view to another view. In addition to displaying market information the format of the display may be directly linked to data entry including order entry. These advantages and more become readily apparent from reading the description below.

The present embodiments now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Figures. The present embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.

Exchanges may represent any exchange that participates in electronic trading. The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange LIFFE the Chicago Board of Trade CBOT the New York Stock Exchange NYSE the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME the Exchange Electronic Trading Xetra a German stock exchange and the European Exchange Eurex are examples of exchanges that participate in electronic trading. Exchanges might also refer to other facilities which include basic to complex systems that automatically match incoming orders. These example exchanges and other exchanges are well known in the art. Communication protocols required for connectivity to one of these exchanges are also well known in the art.

Exchanges allow traders to log onto a market to trade tradable objects. As used herein the term tradable objects refers simply to anything that can be traded with a quantity and or price. It includes but is not limited to all types of tradable objects such as financial products which can include for example stocks options bonds futures currency and warrants as well as funds derivatives and collections of the foregoing and all types of commodities such as grains energy and metals. The tradable object may be real such as products that are listed by an exchange for trading or synthetic such as a combination of real products that is created by the user. A tradable object could actually be a combination of other tradable object such as a class of tradable objects.

An exchange can implement numerous types of order execution algorithms sometimes the type of algorithm depends on the tradable object being traded. Preferably the preferred embodiments can be adapted by one skilled in the art to work with any particular order execution algorithm. Some example order execution algorithms include first in first out and pro rata algorithms. The first in first out FIFO algorithm used for some markets listed with Eurex for example gives priority to the first person to place an order. The pro rata algorithm used for some markets listed with LIFFE for example splits all orders for the same price. The present invention is not limited to any particular type of order execution algorithm.

Regardless of the type of order execution algorithm used each exchange preferably provides similar types of information to subscribing client devices . Market information may include data that represents just the inside market. The inside market is the lowest sell price best ask and the highest buy price best bid at a particular point in time. Market information may also include market depth. Market depth refers to quantities available at the inside market and can also refer to quantities available at other prices away from the inside market. The quantity available at a given price level is usually provided by the host exchange in aggregate sums. In other words an exchange usually provides the total buy quantity and the total sell quantity available in the market at a particular price level in its data feed. The extent of the market depth available to a trader usually depends on the exchange. For instance some exchanges provide market depth for all or most price levels while some provide only quantities associated with the inside market and others may provide no market depth at all. Additionally exchanges can offer other types of market information such as the last traded price LTP the last traded quantity LTQ and order fill information.

Gateways are devices such as a mainframe super minicomputer minicomputer workstation or microcomputer that connect network to networks so that market information can be successfully passed between client devices and exchanges . Gateways receive market information from exchanges and convert it to a form compatible with the protocols used by client devices using conversion techniques known in the art. Also as known by those skilled in the art gateways may have one or more servers to support the data feeds such as a price server for processing price information an order server for processing order information and a fill server for processing fill information. A trader at one of client devices can subscribe to price information order information and fill information for a particular market hosted at exchanges . Gateways also receive transaction information such as orders order changes queries etc. from client devices and forward that information to corresponding exchanges .

Client devices are devices that provide an interface for traders to trade at one or more markets listed with one some or all of exchanges . Some examples of client devices include a personal computer laptop computer hand held computer and so forth. Client devices according to the preferred embodiments include at least a processor and memory. The processor and memory which are both well known computer components are not shown in the Figure for sake of clarity. Preferably the processor has enough processing power to handle and process the various types of market information. Of course the more market information that is received and processed the more processing power is preferred. However any present day processor has enough capability to perform at least the most basic part of the present invention.

Memory may include computer readable medium. The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media includes for example optical or magnetic disks such as storage device. Volatile media includes dynamic memory such as main memory or RAM random access memory . Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape or any other magnetic medium a CD ROM any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM and any other memory chip or cartridge or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Client devices receive market information from any of exchanges . Market information is displayed to the trader s on the visual output device or display device. Upon viewing the market information or a portion thereof a trader may wish to send orders to an exchange cancel orders in a market change orders in a market query an exchange and so on. To do so the trader may input various commands or signals into the client device for example by using one or more conventional means for inputting information such as typing into a keyboard inputting commands through a mouse or inputting commands or signals through some other well known multi purpose input device.

Upon receiving one or more commands or signals client devices preferably generate transaction information. For instance a trader may press a key or button to initiate an order to buy a tradable object. Then transaction information would include an order to buy a particular quantity of the tradable object at a particular price. There are many different types of messages and or order types that can be submitted to an electronic exchange all of which may be considered various types of transaction information. Once generated transaction information is sent from client device to host exchange over network s .

Display screen is the visual output of monitor . In general display screen remains static while other elements on the screen can change. For example window borders on the display screen can change depending on the user s preferences. Window borders surround portions of the display screen that can contain its own document or message and may be re sized or moved around the display screen . According to some operating systems like Microsoft Windows and its variations the display screen can be divided into more than one window each of which has its own boundaries and can contain different market information or another view into the same market . For sake of illustration two windows formed by window borders are shown in display screen although any number of windows may be displayed. In addition the trading windows defined by borders may be made smaller or larger and dragged across display screen to suit the needs of the trader.

Market information may be displayed in a window relative to an axis of prices. For example market information can be displayed in either window defined by borders or relative to an axis of prices associated with that window. More specifically a window may have one or more regions that are aligned with a price axis. For example a region might contain indicators that represent bid information and another region might contain indicators that represent ask information. The bid region and the ask region may be aligned with the axis of prices. Then when changes in the market occur the trader can visualize them by watching indicators in the regions move along the price axis. For a better understanding of the price axis and how it relates to particular regions the reader may refer to the above incorporated patent applications. Additionally trading window examples which show a price axis are described herein with respect to . Trading window examples shown in may also include order entry capabilities however it should be understood that the trading interface of the present embodiments could be used only for displaying market information.

At block a trader can preferably select an item of interest. An item of interest may include the best bid price the best ask price the inside market both the best bid price and the best ask price a moving average a last traded price a theoretical value or any other type of indicator s that a trader may find of particular interest. An item of interest may be a value that is received from an exchange through its electronic messaging. For instance some exchanges provide among other things the inside market in its electronic messaging or price feed. It is also possible that the item of interest has a value that is equal to the result of an expression of an equation or algorithm where the result can be equal to the expression in the equation greater than the expression in the equation or less than the expression in the equation depending on the operator used. For example a 5 hour moving average of the inside market is an example of a solution to an equation where the algorithm averages the inside market over the previous five hours. If there is more than one item of interest then it might be desirable to allow a trader to select one item of interest from a list of options.

If tracking more than one item of interest is preferred then the present embodiments may be programmed to allow for selection of more than one item of interest at any given time. For example a trader might be interested in the inside market and a 1 month moving average of the inside market. Then the present embodiments can reposition the price axis based on the inside market and the 1 month moving average of the inside market.

At block an event occurs which triggers the repositioning signal to reposition the price axis. An event may include any change in value of the item of interest s . An example was given earlier with respect to a 10 day moving average. As soon as the 10 day moving average changed from one value to the next the signal was initialized and the price axis was repositioned. The 10 day moving average is an example of an item of interest being generated by an equation. For another example of an event assume that a trader selected the last traded price as the item of interest and it was last viewed at 105. Shortly thereafter the last traded price changed to 107. The change from 105 to 107 may be a programmed event that triggers the repositioning signal to cause a repositioning of the price axis. This last example showed a change from a whole number to another whole number however an event might also include an instance where the item of interest changed in only fractional increments. According to the preceding example the value of the item of interest changing from 105 to 105.1 is one illustration. This is also assuming that the software tracks or the exchange provides the last traded price in 0.1 increments. In addition an event may be caused by a change equal to the smallest increment of change possible by the item of interest.

There might be instances when a trader does not want the price axis to be repositioned every time a change to the item of interest occurs. Therefore it might be advantageous to provide additional inputs that can be used to determine when the price axis is to be repositioned. shows an example to illustrate the possibilities of additional inputs and how they may be applied in accordance with the present embodiments.

In general shows region with price axis having prices from 119 to 134 in one tick increments and a generic item of interest referred to as A. also shows a limit set at 125 and a limit set at 128. The limit s may be chosen by the trader or hard coded in the software whichever is preferred. If the limit is chosen by the trader an entry field may be provided to enter in the limits. Alternatively a slider bar could be provided. Then for each limit a slider bar may be dragged up or down along the price axis to indicate the number of units of movement that are acceptable by the item of interest before the price axis is repositioned. According to the example shown in the limits may be set to provide more tolerance in movement by the item of interest. When the item of interest A moves outside beyond one of those limits the price axis is repositioned. Additionally the limits may be set so that the price axis is repositioned every time the item of interest moves or changes.

It should also be understood that any number of limits might be applied to accommodate various levels of reposition rates. For example a limit could be placed at 128 131 and off screen such that when the value of the item of interest falls between 128 and 131 the price axis is repositioned at one rate when the value falls between 131 and off screen the price axis is repositioned at a second rate and when the value is greater than off screen the price axis is reposition at a third rate. The number of combinations of limits and rates that can be set according to the present embodiments are virtually endless.

If more than one item of interest was selected then an event occurs when one of the items of interest changes in value or when one of the items of interest moves outside of a boundary whichever mode is used. Also it might be possible that each item of interest uses a different mode. For example an event might occur when the value of one item of interest changes and another event might occur when the value of a second item of interest moves outside of a boundary. If the value of both items of interest changes or moves simultaneously then each change or movement may be programmed to cause an event. Alternatively when the value to both items of interest changes or moves simultaneously only the larger change or movement causes an event. Of course these concepts may be equally applied to situations when more than two items of interest are selected.

It should also be understood that the repositioning signal might be triggered by a trader wishing to manually repositioning the price axis by selecting a repositioning button or icon. If this option is provided it is preferable that the process of manually repositioning the price axis can occur at any time the repositioning button or icon is selected.

At block the price axis is repositioned in response to the signal. The signal can simply be the occurrence of an event. For instance flag bits may be used to signal when the price axis is repositioned. The price axis is preferably repositioned such that the item of interest is centered in a region or if desired the price axis is repositioned such that the item of interest is positioned at another location that is different from the center. If the location is different from the center the trader could select the location that the item of interest should be positioned. Note that it is also possible for a second event to occur while the price axis is being repositioned in response to the first event. In such circumstances it is preferred that the price axis is repositioned according to the second event. Therefore repositioning the price axis to a destination position based on the most recent event is preferred as it takes into account the most recent value of the item of interest.

Referring again to the concepts set forth in blocks and are illustrated. In this instance assume that at some time greater than time T the item of interest A jumped to A which is at a price level of 131. However price level 131 is outside of the upper limit or in this example 128. As a result the price axis would be repositioned so that the A is positioned back into the center of the region or some other designated reference point if not in the center of the region .

So far when a designated event occurs a repositioning signal is initiated and the price axis is repositioned. In addition the price axis may be repositioned at a designated rate. Previously stated the rate is the speed at which the price axis is shifted such that the window goes from showing one view of the price axis to another view. The rate can include a range of speeds from instantaneously repositioning the price axis to very slowly repositioning the price axis. The rate may be defined as the number of pixels per time unit or by some measurement of speed. Although not shown in the step of selecting a rate or rates if more than one rate is used may be added to the process.

According to the present embodiments the rate can be variable or fixed. If the rate is variable then as the price axis is repositioned the speed at which the repositioning occurs may dynamically change. For example the rate of repositioning might be fast and as the item of interest moves closer to the destination position the rate might decrease. The variable rate might be set up by a trader or through some specific algorithm e.g. if the value is off screen then the price axis is moved at 200 pixels per second otherwise the price axis is moved at 50 pixels per second . If the rate is fixed then as the price axis is repositioned the speed at which the repositioning occurs will not change regardless of whether the change in value was large or small.

According to another embodiment the rate is determined based on a certain parameter or parameters. For example parameters might include a minimum rate while the item of interest is on screen a minimum rate while the item of interest is off screen a maximum rate while item of interest is on screen a maximum rate while item of interest is off screen or the distance from the current position to the destination with a smooth rate destination. To illustrate if the item of interest has moved off screen then the rate might be faster than if the item of interest had moved a little off center. The present embodiments are preferably flexible enough to allow the trader to set up various limits and rates variable fixed that correspond to those limits.

The reposition rate may also be adjustable based on other parameters such as maximum acceleration of the rate. This parameter can be employed when the display is being positioned and another signaling event occurs while the positioning is still occurring or if the other factors in a variable rate of repositioning have changed. Either situation would have an old rate and a newly calculated rate perhaps even in the opposite direction. The maximum acceleration of the rate may be used to smoothly transition between the two rates.

Other enhancements may be used to provide the trader with increased flexibility in market views. For example the reposition may be accompanied by a zoom in zoom out of the market or similarly a change of price scale. Zooming in and zooming out may be useful during periods of rapid market movement. In addition this self scaling feature could aid the viewer by zooming out on the price axis to prevent the market from running off the screen and as the item of interest is moved closer to its destination position the display could zoom back in to either the previous zoom level or a preset zoom level of the price axis.

In addition to zooming out and zooming in the present embodiments might link the display to a second display of the same market. The display of the second market could use a larger scale with graphical means depicting the space occupied by the primary display. In particular the second display could show an overview of the market while the primary display could show a more detailed look at the market information near the item of interest or vice versa.

Sometimes a trader might have an interest in more than one market. For instance the trader might have an interest in trading spreads. A spread has two or more underlying tradable objects. To view the activity of each underlying tradable object market the trader might have a trading window open on a screen for each of them. Each window may have a separate price axis against which market information is displayed. According to the present embodiments the price axis of each window may be repositioned when a specified event occurs. For example an event might occur in one market that causes the price axes of all other associated windows to reposition. To illustrate assume that a trader is trading a two legged spread. The trader has three windows displayed on the screen one window for the spread market a second window for the buy leg and a third window for the sell leg. Assume also that a 1 hour moving average of the spread inside market is the item of interest. When the 1 hour moving average changes the price axis in the first window is repositioned. Moreover the price axes of the second and third windows are also repositioned to display relevant market views. Spread trading is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 137 979 entitled System and Method for Performing Automatic Spread Trading filed on May 3 2002. Of course the present embodiments are not limited to spread trading but can be used anytime when markets are preferably grouped together.

As a brief overview price values situated along the price axis are statically displayed. That is the price levels do not normally change positions unless a re centering repositioning or other user initiated command is received. The indicators displayed in other regions such as bid quantity display region and ask quantity display region are dynamic. For example they move up and down along the price axis to reflect the inside market and or market depth for the given tradable object. So for example when the inside market moves up in price quantities populate the appropriate price levels which using the preferred display shows that the inside market has just moved up. Similarly when the inside market moves down in price such that quantities populate the appropriate price levels which shows that the inside market has just moved down. Additionally quantity values displayed in the bid and ask regions are dynamic in the sense that the actual quantity itself may go up or down in magnitude at a particular price level. Regardless of whether the price axis is straight or curved horizontal or vertical or oriented any other angle the display and trading methods of the present embodiments preferably allow the trader to better visualize movement in the market more quickly.

According to the movement of the price axis is smooth and continuous. That is the price axis can be variably positioned in any location to center the item of interest in a region and not have to snap from one marked price level to another marked price level. To illustrate assume for the moment that the item of interest is the last traded price that is currently at 128.5 which is not a marked price level. As a result the price axis is positioned such that the last traded price is directly in the center . Notice that only partial views of the price 136 at and price 121 at are shown. This is because the trading interface according to this embodiment allows smooth and continuous movement of the price axis and therefore a partial display of price levels along price axis may result.

In addition it should be understood that the actual prices do not necessarily have to be displayed. According to this embodiment it is possible to center the market information on the last traded price without the need for displaying the price levels. The bid quantities and the ask quantities would remain in the same positions in their regions .

This example illustrates when the event consists of the inside market moving outside a set limit. show a trading interface for displaying market information along a price axis in region . Of course the limit can be set to any value but for sake of illustration this example assumes a limit set at three ticks away from the top or at the top of the region if the movement of the price axis is smooth and continuous like that shown in and at three ticks away from the bottom or at the bottom of the region if the movement of the price axis is smooth and continuous like that shown in . For this example when one of the inside market prices moves outside of a limit the price axis is repositioned. Another possible way to set limits include when the average of the inside market the average of the best ask and the best bid moves outside of either limit.

According to the inside market and the quantities available at the inside market are centered or near centered in the display regions and . In other words a portion of the price axis from price 139 to price 153 is viewed such that the current inside market price 145 and price 147 are displayed in the center or near center of their respective regions. Of course the inside market may be repositioned to a designated location rather than centering such as offsetting the inside market above or below the center of their regions.

In another embodiment the reposition operation does not necessarily center the inside market but positions the market based on a predictive model. For example using the previous market values the price axis might be positioned so that the inside market is off center to allow for more space on one side e.g. buy side or sell side for the market to continue to move in the direction predicted by the model.

The display of market information may be repositioned at a pre determined rate. According to one embodiment the pre determined rate may be dynamically adjustable based on a number of parameters e.g. minimum rate while the inside market is on screen minimum rate while the inside market is off screen maximum rate while market is on screen maximum rate while market is off screen or the distance from the current position to the destination with a smooth rate destination. . Alternatively the pre determined rate is equal to some fixed hard coded rate. Regardless of whether the pre determined rate is adjustable or fixed it is preferred that the rate may be set slow enough relative to the movement caused by changes in the market such that the view of the market as a whole along the axis of prices is not disturbed to the trader. Being able to set the rate of repositioning to a slow rate is especially important if the item of interest experiences large and sudden changes. Under such circumstances the slow repositioning may actually enhance the visualization of the market trend by allowing a trader to see the movement of the price axis at it is repositioned. In addition sometimes it might be of little significance to set a slow rate especially if the item of interest experiences small changes.

This example illustrates when the event consists of a moving average. According to the moving average price is centered or near centered in the display region . More particularly a portion of the price axis from price 120 to price 134 is viewed in display region such that the current moving average price 127 is displayed in the center or near center. The moving average may be repositioned to a designated location rather than centering such as offsetting the inside market above or below the center of display region .

According to the present embodiments the repositioning rate may be set slow enough to augment the assimilation of market information by enhancing the movement in the movement according to some chose criteria or item of interest. For example a trader would visualize the moving average moving up the price axis indicating that the moving average is increasing in value. Preferably when the price axis is repositioned the axis would slowly be repositioned such that the moving average would return to the center of the display. The trader would visually recognize the moving average has increased in value and can easily see the next change in moving average. Moreover by centering around the moving average for example the trader would know if he or she is trading above or below the moving average by trading above or below the centered average.

Assimilation of market information is important to the success of the trader. According to the preferred embodiments market information is displayed relative to an axis of prices and the information is centered on the chosen item of interest. As market conditions move along the axis of prices the display of market information may be repositioned at a selected rate if so desired around the item of interest. By centering market information around the item of interest a trader may assimilate the market information more efficiently. In addition the repositioning of the price axis may occur at some rate. The rate may be dynamically variable or fixed. The rate may range in speeds from instantaneously repositioning to very slow repositioning. Preferably the rate may be set slow enough to augment the assimilation of market information by enhancing the movement in the market according to some chose criteria or item of interest.

The present embodiments utilize a price axis. Displaying market information in relation to a price axis allows for exceptional market feel and an intuitive sense of where the market is headed. By using a vertically aligned axis of prices for example when the inside market moves up in value the inside market indicators move up the axis and the when the inside market moves down in value the inside market indicators move down the axis. Of course the price axis may be aligned in other directions besides vertically such as horizontally for example. As a result of moving along an axis the preferred embodiments may be utilized to gradually and continuously reposition the price axis and the market information concurrently so that a more desirable portion of the price axis and the market information can be viewed.
