All the aforementioned applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention generally relates to financial data processing and more particularly to a system and method for credit scoring consumer profiling consumer behavior analysis and modeling.

It is axiomatic that consumers will tend to spend more when they have greater purchasing power. The capability to accurately estimate a consumer s risk of default may allow a financial institution such as a credit company lender or any consumer services companies to better target potential prospects and identify any opportunities to increase consumer transaction volumes without an undue increase in the risk of defaults. Attracting additional consumer spending in turn would often increase such financial institution s revenues primarily in the form of an increase in transaction fees and interest payments received. Consequently a consumer model that can accurately estimate risk of default is of paramount interest to many financial institutions and other consumer services companies.

Sufficient systems are not available for appropriately estimating a consumer s risk of default. The existing system typically includes limited and incomplete consumer information from credit bureaus and the like at the aggregate and individual consumer levels. In order to achieve a more complete picture of a consumer s risk of default one must examine in detail a larger range of a consumer s financial accounts including credit accounts checking and savings accounts investment portfolios and the like. However the vast majority of consumers do not maintain all such accounts with the same financial institution and access to detailed financial information from other financial institutions is restricted by consumer privacy laws disclosure policies and security concerns.

Accordingly there is a need for a system and method for suitably modeling a consumer s risk of default which addresses certain problems of existing technologies.

The invention includes a method for determining a comprehensive consumer default risk value for a consumer. An exemplary method comprises obtaining consumer credit data relating to the consumer modeling consumer spending patterns of the consumer using the consumer credit data to obtain an estimated spend capacity of the consumer and calculating the comprehensive consumer default risk value for the consumer based upon the consumer credit data and the estimated spend capacity. The method may optionally include obtaining internal data relating to the consumer and further calculating comprehensive consumer default risk value for the consumer based upon said internal data.

In various embodiments the invention includes determining a comprehensive mortgage consumer default risk value for a consumer. An exemplary method includes obtaining consumer credit data relating to the consumer modeling consumer spending patterns of the consumer using the consumer credit data to obtain an estimated spend capacity of the consumer and calculating the comprehensive consumer default risk value for the consumer based upon the consumer credit data and the estimated spend capacity. The method may optionally include obtaining internal data relating to the consumer and further calculating comprehensive consumer default risk value for the consumer based upon said internal data.

The present invention may also allow an issuer to create a risk model for use in targeting potential consumers make credit decisions regarding existing consumers and increase business with business partners.

The detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation. For example the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented. For the sake of brevity conventional data networking application development and other functional aspects of the systems and components of the individual operating components of the systems may not be described in detail herein. Although the present invention is described as relating to risk modeling of individual consumers one of skill in the pertinent arts will recognize that the various embodiments of the invention can also apply to small businesses and organizations without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

Modeling consumer risk includes in one embodiment obtaining consumer data modeling and or processing the consumer data and creating an output. The output may then be used to make business decisions. In various embodiments the present invention uses a variety of data e.g. consumer data in conjunction with several modeling processing procedures to assess risk.

A debt obligation includes any obligation a consumer has to pay a lender money. Any extension of credit from a lender to a consumer is also considered a debt obligation. A debt obligation may be secured or unsecured. Secured obligations may be secured with either real or personal property. A loan or a credit account are types of debt obligations. A security backed by debt obligations is considered a debt obligation itself. A mortgage includes a loan typically in the form of a promissory note secured by real property. The real property may be secured by any legal means such as for example via a mortgage or deed of trust. For convenience a mortgage is used herein to refer to a loan secured by real property. An automobile loan includes a loan typically in the form of a promissory note which is secured by an automobile. For convenience an automobile loan is used herein to refer to a loan secured by an automobile.

A lender is any person entity software and or hardware that provides lending services. A lender may deal in secured or unsecured debt obligations. A lender may engage in secured debt obligations where either real or personal property acts as collateral. A lender need not originate loans but may hold securities backed by debt obligations. A lender may be only a subunit or subdivision of a larger organization. A mortgage holder includes any person or entity that is entitled to repayment of a mortgage. An automobile loan holder is any person or entity that is entitled to repayment of an automobile loan. As used herein the terms lender and credit issuer may be used interchangeably. Credit issuers may include financial services companies that issue credit to consumers.

A trade or tradeline includes a credit or charge vehicle typically issued to an individual consumer by a credit grantor. Types of tradelines include for example bank loans credit card accounts retail cards personal lines of credit and car loans leases.

Tradeline data describes the consumer s account status and activity such as for example names of companies where the consumer has accounts dates such accounts were opened credit limits types of accounts balances over a period of time and summary payment histories. Tradeline data is generally available for the vast majority of actual consumers. Tradeline data however typically does not include individual transaction data which is largely unavailable because of consumer privacy protections. Tradeline data may be used to determine both individual and aggregated consumer spending patterns as described herein.

Internal data is any data a credit issuer possesses or acquires pertaining to a particular consumer. Internal data may be gathered before during or after a relationship between the credit issuer and the consumer. Such data may include consumer demographic data. Consumer demographic data includes any data pertaining to a consumer. Consumer demographic data may include consumer name address telephone number email address employer and social security number. Consumer transactional data is any data pertaining to the particular transactions in which a consumer engages during any given time period. Consumer transactional data may include transaction amount transaction time transaction vendor merchant and transaction vendor merchant location. Transaction vendor merchant location may contain a high degree of specificity to a vendor merchant. For example transaction vendor merchant location may include a particular gasoline filing station in a particular postal code located at a particular cross section or address. Also for example transaction vendor merchant location may include a particular web address such as a Uniform Resource Locator URL an email address and or an Internet Protocol IP address for a vendor merchant. Transaction vendor merchant location may also include information gathered from a WHOIS database pertaining to the registration of a particular web or IP address. WHOIS databases include databases that contain data pertaining to Internet IP address registrations. Transaction vendor merchant and transaction vendor merchant location may be associated with a particular consumer and further associated with sets of consumers. Consumer payment data includes any data pertaining to a consumer s history of paying debt obligations. Consumer payment data may include consumer payment dates payment amounts balance amount and credit limit. Internal data may further comprise records of consumer service calls complaints requests for credit line increases questions and comments. A record of a consumer service call includes for example date of call reason for call and any transcript or summary of the actual call.

Internal data may further comprise closed loop data and open loop data. Closed loop data includes data obtained from a credit issuer s closed loop transaction system. A closed loop transaction system includes transaction systems under the control of one party. Closed loop transaction systems may be used to obtain consumer transactional data. Open loop data includes data obtained from a credit issuer s open loop transaction system. An open loop transaction system includes transaction systems under the control of multiple parties. Credit bureau data is any data retained by a credit bureau pertaining to a particular consumer. A credit bureau is any organization that collects and or distributes consumer data. A credit bureau may be a consumer reporting agency. Credit bureaus generally collect financial information pertaining to consumers. Credit bureau data may include consumer account data credit limits balances and payment history. Credit bureau data may include credit bureau scores that reflect a consumer s creditworthiness. Credit bureau scores are developed from data available in a consumer s file such as the amount of lines of credit payment performance balance and number of tradelines. The data available in a consumer s file is used to model the risk of a consumer over a period of time using statistical regression analysis. In one embodiment those data elements that are found to be indicative of risk are weighted and combined to determine the credit score. For example each data element may be given a score with the final credit score being the sum of the data element scores.

Any transaction account or credit account discussed herein may include an account or an account number. An account or account number as used herein may include any device code number letter symbol digital certificate smart chip digital signal analog signal biometric or other identifier indicia suitably configured to allow the consumer to access interact with or communicate with the system e.g. one or more of an authorization access code personal identification number PIN Internet code other identification code and or the like . The account number may optionally be located on or associated with a rewards card charge card credit card debit card prepaid card telephone card embossed card smart card magnetic stripe card bar code card transponder radio frequency card or an associated account. The system may include or interface with any of the foregoing cards or devices or a fob having a transponder and RFID reader in RF communication with the fob. Although the system may include a fob embodiment the invention is not to be so limited. Indeed system may include any device having a transponder which is configured to communicate with RFID reader via RF communication. Typical devices may include for example a key ring tag card cell phone wristwatch or any such form capable of being presented for interrogation. Moreover the system computing unit or device discussed herein may include a pervasive computing device which may include a traditionally non computerized device that is embedded with a computing unit. Examples can include watches Internet enabled kitchen appliances restaurant tables embedded with RF readers wallets or purses with imbedded transponders etc.

To model consumer spending power consumer spend may be determined over previous periods of time sometimes referred to herein as the consumer s size of wallet from tradeline data sources. The share of wallet by tradeline or account type may also be determined. The size of wallet SoW is represented by a consumer s or business total aggregate spending and the share of wallet represents how the consumer uses different payment instruments. Methods and apparatus for calculating the size of wallet have been disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 169 588 which was published with publication number 2006 0242046 A1 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Methods and apparatus for calculating the size of wallet have also been disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 586 737 which was published with publication number U.S. 2007 0226130 A1 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Exemplary size of wallet determinations will now be discussed in detail 

Consumer panel data measures consumer spending patterns from information that is provided by typically millions of participating consumer panelists. Exemplary consumer panel data is available through various consumer research companies such as comScore Networks Inc. of Reston Va. Consumer panel data may include individual consumer information such as for example credit risk scores credit card application data credit card purchase transaction data credit card statement views tradeline types balances credit limits purchases balance transfers cash advances payments made finance charges annual percentage rates and fees charged. Such individual information from consumer panel data however may be limited to those consumers who have participated in the consumer panel and so such detailed data may not be available for all consumers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the use of the term computer or any similar term includes any type of hardware or software in which a host is able to acquire information. Such computers may include personal computers personal digital assistants biometric devices transaction account devices loyalty accounts and or the like.

As shown in a population of consumers for which individual and or aggregated data has been provided may be divided into two general categories for analysis for example those that are current on their credit accounts representing 1.72 million consumers in the exemplary data sample size of 1.78 million consumers and those that are delinquent representing 0.06 million of such consumers . In one embodiment delinquent consumers may be discarded from the populations being modeled.

In further embodiments the population of current consumers is subdivided into a plurality of further categories based on the amount of balance information available and the balance activity of such available data. In the example shown in FIG the amount of balance information available is represented by a string of 0 and characters. Each character represents one month of available data with the rightmost character representing the most current months and the leftmost character representing the earliest month for which data is available. In the example provided in a string of six characters is provided representing the six most recent months of data for each category. The character represents a month in which a credit account balance of the consumer has increased. The 0 character may represent months where the account balance is zero. The character represents months for which balance data is unavailable. Also provided in is number of consumers that fall into each category and the percentage of the consumer population they represent in that sample.

In further embodiments only certain categories of consumers may be selected for modeling behavior. The selection may be based on those categories that demonstrate increased spend on their credit balances over time. However it should be readily appreciated that other categories can be used. shows an example of two categories of selected consumers for modeling . These groups show the availability of at least the three most recent months of balance data and that the balances increased in each of those months.

Turning now to which shows sub categorization of the two categories that are selected for modeling. In the embodiment shown the sub categories may include consumers having a most recent credit balance less than 400 consumers having a most recent credit balance between 400 and 1600 consumers having a most recent credit balance between 1600 and 5000 consumers whose most recent credit balance is less than the balance of for example three months ago consumers whose maximum credit balance increase over for example the last twelve months divided by the second highest maximum balance increase over the same period is less than 2 and consumers whose maximum credit balance increase over the last twelve months divided by the second highest maximum balance increase is greater than 2. It should be readily appreciated that other subcategories can be used. Each of these subcategories is defined by their last month balance level. The number of consumers from the sample population in millions and the percentage of the population for each category are also shown in .

There may be a certain balance threshold established wherein if a consumer s account balance is too high their behavior may not be modeled since such consumers are less likely to have sufficient spending ability. In another embodiment consumers having balances above such threshold may be sub categorized yet again rather than completely discarded from the sample. In the example shown in the threshold value may be 5000 and only those having particular historical balance activity may be selected i.e. those consumers whose present balance is less than their balance three months earlier or whose maximum balance increase in the examined period meets certain parameters. Other threshold values may also be used and may be dependent on the individual and aggregated consumer data provided.

The models generated may be derived validated and refined using tradeline and consumer panel data. An example of tradeline data from Experian and consumer panel data from comScore is represented in . Each row of the data represents the record of one consumer and thousands of such records may be provided at a time. The statement shows the point in time balance of consumers accounts for three successive months Balance 1 Balance 2 and Balance 3 . The data shows each consumer s purchase volume last payment amount previous balance amount and current balance. Such information may be obtained for example by page scraping the data in any of a variety of known manners using appropriate application programming interfaces from an Internet web site or network address at which the data is displayed.

Furthermore the data may be matched by consumer identity and combined by one of the data providers or another third party independent of the financial institution. Validation of the models using the combined data may then be performed and such validation may be independent of consumer identity.

Turning now to an exemplary process for estimating the size of an individual consumer s spending wallet is shown. Upon completion of the modeling of the consumer categories above the process commences with the selection of individual consumers or prospects to be examined step . An appropriate model derived for each category will then be applied to the presently available consumer trade line information in the following manner to determine based on the results of application of the derived models an estimate of a consumer s size of wallet. Each consumer of interest may be selected based on their falling into one of the categories selected for modeling described above or may be selected using any of a variety of criteria.

The process continues to step Where for a selected consumer a paydown percentage over a previous period of time is estimated for each of the consumer s credit accounts. In one embodiment the paydown percentage is estimated over the previous three month period of time based on available tradeline data and may be calculated according to the following formula Pay down The sum of the last three months payments from the account The sum of three month balances for the account based on tradeline data .

The paydown percentage may be set to for example 2 for any consumer exhibiting less than a 5 paydown percentage and may be set to 100 if greater than 80 as a simplified manner for estimating consumer spending behaviors on either end of the paydown percentage scale.

Consumers that exhibit less than a 50 paydown during a three month period may be categorized as revolvers while consumers that exhibit a 50 paydown or greater may be categorized as transactors. These categorizations may be used to initially determine what if any purchasing incentives may be available to the consumer as described later below.

The process then continues to step where balance transfers for a previous period of time are identified from the available tradeline data for the consumer. Although tradeline data may reflect a higher balance on a credit account over time such higher balance may simply be the result of a transfer of a balance into the account and are thus not indicative of a true increase in the consumer s spending. It is difficult to confirm balance transfers based on tradeline data since the information available is not provided on a transaction level basis. In addition there are typically lags or absences of reporting of such values on tradeline reports.

consumer financial records has revealed reliable ways in which balance transfers into an account may be identified from imperfect individual tradeline data alone. Three exemplary reliable methods for identifying balance transfers from credit accounts each which is based in part on actual consumer data sampled are as follows.

It should be readily apparent that the formulas in the form recited above are not necessary for all embodiments of the present process and may vary based on the consumer data used to derive them.

A first rule identifies a balance transfer for a given consumer s credit account as follows. The month having the largest balance increase in the tradeline data and which satisfies the following conditions may be identified as a month in which a balance transfer has occurred 

A second rule identifies a balance transfer for a given consumer s credit account in any month where the balance is above twelve times the previous month s balance and the next month s balance differs by no more than 20 .

The process then continues to step where consumer spending on each credit account is estimated over the next for example three month period. In estimating consumer spend any spending for a month in which a balance transfer has been identified from individual tradeline data above is set to zero for purposes of estimating the size of the consumer s spending wallet reflecting the supposition that no real spending has occurred on that account. The estimated spend for each of the three previous months may then be calculated as follows Estimated spend the current balance the previous month s balance the previous month s balance the estimated pay down from step 604 above .

The exact form of the formula selected may be based on the category in which the consumer is identified from the model applied and the formula is then computed iteratively for each of the three months of the first period of consumer spend.

Next at step the estimated spend is then extended over for example the previous three quarterly or three month periods providing a most recent year of estimated spend for the consumer.

Finally at step the data output from step in turn may be used to generate a plurality of final outputs for each consumer account. These may be provided in an output file that may include a portion or all of the following exemplary information based on the calculations above and information available from individual tradeline data 

 i size of previous twelve month spending wallet ii size of spending wallet for each of the last four quarters iii total number of revolving cards revolving balance and average pay down percentage for each iv total number of transacting cards and transacting balances for each v the number of balance transfers and total estimated amount thereof vi maximum revolving balance amounts and associated credit limits and vii maximum transacting balance and associated credit limit.

After step the process may end with respect to the examined consumer. It should be readily appreciated that the process may be repeated for any number of current consumers or consumer prospects.

Such estimated spending may be calculated in a rolling manner across each previous three month quarterly period. For example spending in each of a first three months of a first quarter may be calculated based on balance values the category of the consumer based on the above referenced consumer categorization spending models and the formulas used in steps and . Calculation may continue every three months using the previous three months data as an input.

It should be readily appreciated that as the rolling calculations proceed the consumer s category may change based on the outputs that result and therefore different formula corresponding to the new category may be applied to the consumer for different periods of time. The rolling manner described above maximizes the known data used for estimating consumer spend in a previous twelve month period. Based on the final output generated for the consumer commensurate purchasing incentives may he identified and provided to the consumer for example in anticipation of an increase in the consumer s purchasing ability as projected by the output file. In such cases consumers of good standing who are categorized as transactors with a projected increase in purchasing ability may be offered a lower financing rate on purchases made during the period of expected increase in their purchasing ability or may be offered a discount or rebate for transactions with selected merchants during that time.

In such cases consumers of good standing who are categorized as transactors with a projected increase in purchasing ability may be offered a lower financing rate on purchases made during the period of expected increase in their purchasing ability or may be offered a discount or rebate for transactions with selected merchants during that time.

In another example and in the case where a consumer is a revolver a consumer with a projected increase in purchasing ability may be offered a lower annual percentage rate on balances maintained on their credit account. Other like promotions and enhancements to consumers experiences are well known and may be used within the processes disclosed herein.

Prospective consumer populations used for modeling and or later evaluation may be provided from any of a plurality of available marketing groups or may be culled from credit bureau data targeted advertising campaigns or the like. Testing and analysis may be continuously performed to identify the optimal placement and required frequency of such sources for using the size of spending wallet calculations. The processes described herein may also be used to develop models for predicting a size of wallet for an individual consumer in the future.

Institutions adopting the processes disclosed herein may expect to more readily and profitably identify opportunities for prospect and consumer offerings which in turn provides enhanced experiences across all parts of a consumer s lifecycle. In the case of a credit provider accurate identification of spend opportunities allows for rapid provisioning of card member offerings to increase spend that in turn results in increased transaction fees interest charges and the like. The careful selection of consumers to receive such offerings reduces the incidence of fraud that may occur in less disciplined cardmember incentive programs. The reduced incidence of fraud in turn reduces overall operating expenses for institutions.

As mentioned above the process described may also be used to develop models for predicting a size of wallet for an individual consumer in the future. The capacity a consumer has for spending in a variety of categories is the share of wallet.

The model used to determine share of wallet for particular spend categories using the processes described herein is the share of wallet SoW model. The SoW mod provides estimated data and or characteristics information that is more indicative of consumer spending power than typical credit bureau data or scores. The SoW model may output with sufficient accuracy data that is directly related to the spend capacity of an individual consumer. One of skill in the art will recognize that any one or combination of the following data types as well as other data types may be output by the SoW model without altering the spirit and scope of the present invention.

The size of a consumer s twelve month spending wallet is an example output of the SoW model. A consumer s twelve month spending wallet may be output as an actual or rounded dollar amount. The size of a consumer s spending wallet for each of several consecutive quarters for example the most recent four quarters may also be output.

The SoW model output may include the total number of revolving cards held by a consumer the consumer s revolving balance and or the consumer s average pay down percentage of the revolving cards. The maximum revolving balance and associated credit limits can be determined for the consumer as well as the size of the consumer s revolving spending.

Similarly the SoW model output may include the total number of a consumer s transaction cards and or the consumer s transaction balance. The SoW model may additionally output the maximum transacting balance the associated credit limit and or the size of transactional spending of the consumer.

These outputs as well as any other outputs from the SoW model may be appended to data profiles of a company s consumers and prospects. The output enhances the company s ability to make decisions involving prospecting new applicant evaluation and consumer relationship management across the consumer lifecycle. The SOW score can focus for example on total spend transaction account spend and or a consumer s spending trend.

Using the processes described above balance transfers are factored out of a consumer s spend capacity. Further when correlated with a risk score the SoW score may provide more insight into behavior characteristics of relatively low risk consumers and relatively high risk consumers.

The SoW score may be structured in one of several ways. For instance the score may be a numeric score that reflects a consumer s spend in various ranges over a given time period such as the last quarter or year. As an example a score of 5000 might indicate that a consumer spent between 5000 and 6000 in the given time period.

The score may include a range of numbers or a numeric indicator such as an exponent that indicates the trend of a consumer s spend over a given time period. For example a trend score of 4 may indicate that a consumer s spend has increased over the previous 4 months while a trend score of 4 may indicate that a consumers spend has decreased over the previous 4 months.

In addition to determining an overall SoW score the SoW model outputs may each be given individual scores and used as attributes for consideration in credit score development by for example traditional credit bureaus. As discussed above credit scores are traditionally based on information in a consumer s credit bureau file.

Outputs of the SoW model such as balance transfer information spend capacity and trend and revolving balance information may be more indicative of risk than some traditional data elements. Therefore a company may use scored SoW outputs in addition to or in place of traditional data elements when computing a final credit score. SoW output information may be collected analyzed and or summarized in a scorecard. Such a scorecard would be useful to for example credit bureaus major credit grantors and scoring companies such as Fair Isaac Corporation of Minneapolis Minn.

The SoW modeling however is only one potential component of the comprehensive consumer default risk that a consumer presents to a lender. A comprehensive consumer default risk value is a value that describes the risk that a consumer will default on any debt obligation. The debt obligation may be held by any lender or credit issuer. Calculating the comprehensive consumer default risk value can be done by any suitable means.

In various embodiments the comprehensive consumer default risk value is calculated using a SoW output combined with credit bureau data. In various embodiments internal data may be used in addition to a SoW output and credit bureau data 

In various embodiments calculating the comprehensive consumer default risk value involves as depicted in obtaining consumer credit data modeling consumer spending patterns and calculating a comprehensive consumer delimit risk value . Calculating the comprehensive consumer default risk value may also involve obtaining internal data for a given consumer .

Consumer credit data may be obtained from any source such as for example a credit bureau. Modeling consumer spending patterns may include any process or method designed to assess the spending pattern of a consumer such as for example the Soil model.

Calculating the comprehensive consumer default risk value may involve the process depicted in namely assigning a consumer population segment selecting an appropriate risk factor relationship and deriving a default probability based upon said risk factor relationship. Assigning a consumer population segment includes any method for assigning consumers into population segments. A consumer population segment may be based upon for example high risk consumers and low risk consumers categories. A consumer population segment may be based upon primary residence value. Selecting an appropriate risk factor relationship may include any method of creating a relationship between risk factors. Selecting an appropriate risk factor relationship may be dependent upon the assigned consumer population segment. Risk actors include any method of assessing risk. Risk factors may include risk factors derived from credit bureau data internal data merchant data or any other factor that may he predictive of risk. A risk factor relationship may take the form of for example an equation. An equation includes linear exponential and logarithmic equations. An equation may assign fixed coefficients associated with a particular risk factor. A coefficient in an equation may vary depending upon the particular consumer population segment assigned. Deriving a default probability based upon said risk factor relationship may take the form of for example an equation. An equation includes linear exponential and logarithmic equations. For example a logarithmic equation may transform a risk relationship into a default probability . A default probability may take the form of a probability value between 0 and 1.

Outputs of the total structural risk TSR model can be used in any business or market segment that extends credit or otherwise needs to evaluate the creditworthiness of a particular consumer. For simplicity these businesses will be referred to herein as falling into one of three categories financial services companies retail companies and other companies.

The business cycle in each category may be divided into three phases acquisition retention and disposal. The acquisition phase occurs when a business is attempting to gain new consumers. The acquisition phase includes for example targeted marketing determining what products or services to offer a consumer deciding whether to lend to a particular consumer and what the line size or loan should be and deciding whether to buy a particular loan. The retention phase occurs after a consumer is already associated with the business. In the retention phase the business interests shift to managing the consumer relationship through for example consideration of risk determination of credit lines cross sell opportunities increasing business from that consumer and increasing the company s assets under management.

The disposal phase is entered when a business wishes to dissociate itself from a consumer or otherwise end the consumer relationship. The disposal phase can occur for example through settlement offers collections and sale of defaulted or near default loans.

Financial services companies include for example banks and other lenders mutual fund companies financiers of leases and sales life insurance companies online brokerages credit issuers and loan buyers.

Banks and lenders can utilize the TSR model in all phases of the business cycle. One exemplary use is in relation to home equity loans and the rating given to a particular bond issue in the capital market. The TSR model applies to home equity lines of credit and automobile loans in a similar manner.

If the holder of a home equity loan for example borrows from the capital market the loan holder issues asset backed securities ABS or bonds which are backed by receivables. The loan holder is thus an ABS issuer. The ABS issuer applies for an ABS rating which is assigned based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables. One of skill in the art will recognize that the ABS issuer may apply for the ABS rating through any application means without altering the spirit and scope of the present invention. In assigning a rating the rating agencies weigh a loan s probability of default by considering the lender s underwriting and portfolio management processes. Lenders generally secure higher ratings by credit enhancement. Examples of credit enhancement include for example over collateralization buying insurance such as wrap insurance and structuring ABS through for example senior subordinate bond structures sequential pay vs. parallel pay etc. to achieve higher ratings. Lenders and rating agencies take the probability of default into consideration when determining the appropriate level of credit enhancement.

During the acquisition phase of a loan lenders may use the TSR model to improve their lending decisions. Before issuing the loan lenders can evaluate a consumer s risk of default for making payments on the loan. Evaluation leads to fewer had loans and a reduced probability of default for loans in the lender s portfolio. A lower probability of default means that for a given loan portfolio that was originated using the TSR model either a higher rating can be obtained with the same degree of over collateralization or the degree of over collateralization can be reduced for a given debt rating. Thus using the TSR model at the acquisition stage of the loan reduces the lender s overall borrowing cost and loan loss reserves.

During the retention phase of a loan the TSR model can be used to track a consumer s varying degree of risk. Based on the TSR outputs the lender can make various decisions regarding the consumer relationship. For example a lender may use the TSR model to identify borrowers who become more likely to default. The credit lines of those borrowers which have not fully been drawn down can then be reduced. Selectively revoking unused lines of credit may reduce the probability of default for loans in a given portfolio and reduce the lender s borrowing costs. Selectively revoking unused lines of credit may also reduce the lender s risk by minimizing further exposure to a borrower that may already be in financial distress.

Also during the retention phase of a loan the TSR model may allow lenders to identify consumers for further marketing of business partners. A lender may partner with other businesses that wish to sell their products and services to the lender s consumers. The lender can use the TSR model to identify consumers with a risk of default profile desired by its partners. The lender may then use that information to increase those consumers spend with the business partner. For example a particular merchant may want to market to low risk high spend consumers. The lender may identify those consumers using the TSR model and either convey the information to the particular partner merchant and in one embodiment market the particular merchant s goods to the consumer directly.

During the disposal phase of a loan the TSR model enables lenders to better predict the likelihood that a borrower will default. Once the lender has identified consumers who are in danger of default the lender may select those likely to repay and extend settlement offers. Additionally lenders can use the TSR model to identify which consumers are unlikely to pay and those who are otherwise not worth extending a settlement offer.

The TSR model allows lenders to identify loans with risk of default allowing lenders prior to default to begin anticipating a course of action to take if default occurs. Because freshly defaulted loans obtain a higher sale price than loans that have been non performing for longer time periods lenders may sell these loans earlier in the default period thereby reducing the lender s costs.

The ability to predict and manage risk before default often results in a lower likelihood of default for loans in the lender s portfolio. Further even in the event of a defaulted loan the lender can detect the default early and thereby recoup a higher percentage of the value of that loan. A lender using the TSR model can thus show to the rating agencies that it uses a combination of tight underwriting criteria and robust post lending portfolio management processes. Tight underwriting criteria and robust post lending portfolio management processes enable the lender to increase the ratings of the ABS that are backed by a given pool or portfolio of loans and or reduce the level of over collateralization or credit enhancement in order to obtain a particular rating.

Turning to mutual funds the TSR model may be used to manage the relationship with consumers who interact directly with the company. During the retention phase if the mutual fund company concludes that a consumer s risk of default has decreased the company can then market additional funds to the consumer. The company can also cross sell other services to the consumer with greater confidence 

Financiers of leases or sales such as automobile lease or sale financiers can benefit from TSR outputs in much the same way as a bank or lender as discussed above. In typical product financing however the amount of the loan or lease is based on the value of the product being financed. Therefore there is generally no credit limit that needs to be revisited during the course of the loan. As there is no need to revisit credit limit the TSR model is very useful to lease sales finance companies during the acquisition and disposal phases of the business cycle.

Just as the TSR model can help loan holders determine that a particular loan is nearing default loan buyers can use the model to evaluate the quality of a prospective purchase during the acquisition phase of the business cycle. The TSR model thus may assist loan buyers in avoiding or reducing the sale prices of loans that are in likelihood of default.

Aspects of the retail industry for which the TSR model would be advantageous include for example retail stores having private label cards on line retailers and mail order companies.

There are two general types of credit and charge cards in the marketplace today multipurpose cards and private label cards. A third type of hybrid card is emerging. Multipurpose cards are cards that can be used at multiple different merchants and service providers. For example American Express Visa Mastercard and Discover are considered multipurpose card issuers. Multipurpose cards are accepted by merchants and other service providers in what is often referred to as an open network. Transactions are routed from a point of sale POS through a network for authorization transaction posting and settlement.

A variety of intermediaries play different roles in the process. These include merchant processors the brand networks and issuer processors. An open network is often referred to as an interchange network. Multipurpose cards include a range of different card types such as charge cards revolving cards and debit cards. Debit cards are linked to a consumer s demand deposit account DDA or checking account 

Private label cards are cards that can be used for the purchase of goods and services from a single merchant or service provider. Historically major department stores were the originators of private label cards. Private label cards are now offered by a wide range of retailers and other service providers. These cards are generally processed on a closed network with transactions flowing between the merchant s POS and its own backoffice or the processing center for a third party processor. These transactions do not flow through an interchange network and are not subject to interchange fees.

Recently a type of hybrid card has evolved. A hybrid card when used at a particular merchant is that merchant s private label card but when used elsewhere becomes a multipurpose card. The particular merchant s transactions are processed in the proprietary private label network. Transactions made with the card at all other merchants and service providers are processed through an interchange network.

Private label card issuers in addition to multipurpose card issuers and hybrid card issuers can apply the TSR model in a similar way as described above with respect to credit card companies. That is knowledge of a consumer s risk of default as well as knowledge of the other TSR outputs may be used by card issuers to improve performance and profitability across the entire business cycle.

Online retail and mail order companies can use the TSR model in both the acquisition and retention phases of the business cycle. During the acquisition phase for example the companies can base targeted marketing strategies on TSR outputs. Use in the acquisition phase may substantially reduce costs especially in the mail order industry where catalogs are typically sent to a wide variety of individuals. During the retention phase companies can for example base cross sell strategies or credit line extensions on TSR outputs.

Types of companies which also may make use of the TSR model include for example the gaming industry communications providers and the travel industry.

The gaming industry can use the TSR model in for example the acquisition and retention phases of the business cycle. Casinos often extend credit to their wealthiest and or most active players also known as high rollers. The casinos can use the TSR model in the acquisition phase to determine whether credit should be extended to an individual. Once credit has been extended the casinos can use the TSR model to periodically review the consumer s risk of default. If there is a change in the spend capacity the casinos may alter the consumer s credit line to be more commensurate with the consumer s risk of default.

Communications providers such as telephone service providers often contract into service plans with their consumers. In addition to improving their targeted marketing strategies communications providers can use the TSR outputs during the acquisition phase to determine the risk of default on a service contract associated with a potential consumer.

Members of the travel industry can make use of the TSR outputs in the acquisition and retention stages of the business cycle. For example a hotelier typically has a brand of hotel that is associated with a particular star level or class of hotel. In order to capture various market segments hoteliers may be associated with several hotel brands that are of different classes. During the acquisition phase of the business cycle a hotelier may use the TSR outputs to target individuals that have appropriate spend capacities for various classes of hotels. During the retention phase the hotelier may use the TSR outputs to determine for example when a particular individual s risk of default decreases. Based on that determination the hotelier can market a higher class of hotel to the consumer in an attempt to convince the consumer to upgrade.

One of skill in the relevant art s will recognize that many of the above described TSR applications may be utilized by other industries and market segments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example the strategy of using TSR to model an industry s best consumer and targeting individuals sharing characteristics of that best consumer can be applied to nearly all industries.

TSR data can also be used across nearly all industries to improve consumer loyalty by reducing the number of payment reminders sent to responsible accounts. Responsible accounts are those that are most likely to pay even without being contacted by a collector. The reduction in reminders may increase consumer loyalty because the consumer will not feel that the lender or service provider is unduly aggressive. The lender s or service provider s collection costs are also reduced and resources are freed to dedicate to accounts requiring more persuasion.

Additionally the TSR model may be used in any company having a large consumer service call center to identify specific types of consumers. Transcripts are typically made for any call from a consumer to a call center. These transcripts may be scanned for specific keywords or topics and combined with the TSR model to determine the consumer s characteristics. For example a bank having a large consumer service center may scan service calls for discussions involving bankruptcy. The bank may then use the TSR model with the indications from the call center transcripts to evaluate the consumer.

The risk model may provide information to supplement a promotional campaign. Campaign statistics enable a merchant to view information regarding any number of active and or inactive offers for loan products. Such information may include for example campaign type current status number of impressions a number of clicks resulting from the impressions yield rate average cost per yield total cost and the like. Campaign statistics provide the merchant with a powerful tool that may lead to for example canceling or modifying a campaign if it is not profitable. The campaign statistics interface further allows the merchant to pause and resume offer campaigns edit campaigns and delete campaigns.

In one exemplary embodiment the ability to store a wide variety of information in different formats is facilitated by storing the information as a BLOB. Thus any binary information can be stored in a storage space associated with a data set. As discussed above the binary information may be stored on the financial transaction instrument or external to but affiliated with the financial transaction instrument. The BLOB method may store data sets as ungrouped data elements formatted as a block of binary via a fixed memory offset using either fixed storage allocation circular queue techniques or best practices with respect to memory management e.g. paged memory least recently used etc. . By using BLOB methods the ability to store various data sets that have different formats facilitates the storage of data associated with the system by multiple and unrelated owners of the data sets. For example a first data set which may be stored may be provided by a first party a second data set which may be stored may be provided by an unrelated second party and yet a third data set which may be stored may be provided by an third party unrelated to the first and second party. Each of these three exemplary data sets may contain different information that is stored using different data storage formats and or techniques. Further each data set may contain subsets of data that also may be distinct from other subsets.

As stated above in various embodiments of system the data can be stored without regard to a common format. However in one exemplary embodiment of the invention the data set e.g. BLOB may be annotated in a standard manner when provided for manipulating the data onto the financial transaction instrument. The annotation may comprise a short header trailer or other appropriate indicator related to each data set that is configured to convey information useful in managing the various data sets. For example the annotation may be called a condition header header trailer or status herein and may comprise an indication of the status of the data set or may include an identifier correlated to a specific issuer or owner of the data. In one example the first three bytes of each data set BLOB may be configured or configurable to indicate the status of that particular data set e.g. LOADED INITIALIZED READY BLOCKED REMOVABLE or DELETED. Subsequent bytes of data may be used to indicate for example the identity of the issuer user transaction membership account identifier or the like. Each of these condition annotations are further discussed herein.

The data set annotation may also be used for other types of status information as well as various other purposes. For example the data set annotation may include security information establishing access levels. The access levels may for example be configured to permit only certain individuals levels of employees companies or other entities to access data sets or to permit access to specific data sets based on the transaction merchant issuer user or the like. Furthermore the security information may restrict permit only certain actions such as accessing modifying and or deleting data sets. In one example the data set annotation indicates that only the data set owner or the user are permitted to delete a data set various identified users may be permitted to access the data set for reading and others are altogether excluded from accessing the data set. However other access restriction parameters may also be used allowing various entities to access a data set with various permission levels as appropriate.

The data including the header or trailer may be received by a stand alone interaction device configured to add delete modify or augment the data in accordance with the header or trailer. As such in one embodiment the header or trailer is not stored on the transaction device along with the associated issuer owned data but instead the appropriate action may be taken by providing to the transaction instrument user at the stand alone device the appropriate option for the action to be taken. The present invention contemplates a data storage arrangement wherein the header or trailer or header or trailer history of the data is stored on the transaction instrument in relation to the appropriate data.
