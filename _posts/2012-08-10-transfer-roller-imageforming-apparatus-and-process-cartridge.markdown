This application is based on and claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 035512 filed Feb. 21 2012.

Electrophotographic image forming apparatuses charge the surface of an image carrier such as a photoreceptor with a charging device form an electrostatic latent image with for example a laser beam modulated with an image signal and develop the electrostatic latent image with a charged toner to form a toner image as a visible image. For an intermediate transfer system the toner image is electrostatically transferred via an intermediate transfer belt to a recording medium such as recording paper and is fixed to the recording medium.

Conductive rollers are developed and used in the art to apply a voltage for transferring the toner image from the image carrier to the surface of the intermediate transfer belt.

According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a transfer roller including a conductive support a first conductive elastic layer disposed on the conductive support and a second conductive elastic layer disposed on the first conductive elastic layer. A common logarithm of surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is higher than a common logarithm of volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer by about 1 or more.

As shown in a transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment includes for example a hollow or solid cylindrical conductive support shaft a first conductive elastic layer disposed on the outer surface of the conductive support and a second conductive elastic layer disposed on the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer .

The common logarithm of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is higher than the common logarithm of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer by 1 or more or about 1 or more. It should be noted that the common logarithm log sq of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer and the common logarithm log cm of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer are compared for their values by ignoring their units.

The transfer roller thus constructed according to this exemplary embodiment may scatter little toner during transfer.

A transfer roller for use with an image forming apparatus is disposed opposite an image carrier or a support roller hereinafter other roller . In use the other roller applies a load to the transfer roller to form a nip i.e. a region where the transfer roller is pressed by the other roller . As a voltage is applied across the nip a current flows across the nip from the transfer roller to the other roller or from the other roller to the transfer roller. The transfer roller however might cause discharge or leak current in the region around the nip i.e. a region where the transfer roller is not pressed by the other roller .

If the transfer roller is applied to an image forming apparatus the discharge or leak current might scatter toner during transfer thus causing degradation blurring in the resulting image.

For the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment the common logarithm of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is higher than the common logarithm of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer by 1 or more or about 1 or more. That is the second conductive elastic layer is anisotropic in conductivity between the planar and radial directions. The second conductive elastic layer may therefore allow less current to flow in the planar direction than in the radial direction.

If the transfer roller forms a nip with another roller in an image forming apparatus the transfer roller may allow a current to flow across the nip from the transfer roller to the other roller or from the other roller to the transfer roller without causing substantial discharge or leak current in the region around the nip.

If the transfer roller is applied to an image forming apparatus therefore the transfer roller may scatter little toner during transfer thus causing little degradation blurring in the resulting image.

The illustrated structure is not intended to be limiting. For example the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment may include an intermediate layer between the first conductive elastic layer and the conductive support . The transfer roller may also include a resistance adjusting layer or transfer preventing layer between the first conductive elastic layer and the second conductive elastic layer .

The conductive support may also be for example a member e.g. a resin or ceramic member having the outer surface thereof plated or a member e.g. a resin or ceramic member having a conductor dispersed therein.

The rubber elastomer is for example an elastomer having at least a double bond in the chemical structure thereof.

The volume resistivity of the first conductive elastic layer is adjusted depending on for example the type and amount of conductor added.

The procedure for measuring the volume resistivity of the first conductive elastic layer will now be described with reference to .

A measurement roller is first provided by removing the second conductive elastic layer from the transfer roller to expose the first conductive elastic layer .

As illustrated in the measurement roller is placed on a metal plate . A voltage of 1 000 V is applied across a core and the metal plate at 22 C. and 55 RH while applying a load of 500 g to the positions indicated by the arrows A and A at both ends of the core . The current I A is read after 10 seconds and the volume resistance R is calculated by the equation R V I. This measurement and calculation is carried out at four positions by rotating the measurement roller by 90 in the circumferential direction and the average volume resistance R is calculated as the volume resistance R of the measurement roller .

The volume resistivity v cm of the first conductive elastic layer is calculated from the volume resistance R of the measurement roller by the following equation where L cm is the length of the roller in the axial direction W cm is the width of the contact nip between the roller and the electrode and t cm is the thickness of the first conductive elastic layer . The above equation yields the resistivity.

The thickness of the first conductive elastic layer may be for example 5 to 20 mm preferably 5 to 15 mm.

The common logarithm of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is higher than the common logarithm of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer by 1 or more or about 1 or more.

The surface resistivity log sq and volume resistivity log cm of the second conductive elastic layer are measured by the following procedures.

The second conductive elastic layer of the transfer roller is first cut open into a sheet. The sheet is cut in the center thereof to form a 4 4 cm measurement sample.

The surface resistivity is measured using a circular probe e.g. UR Probe for HIRESTA IP available from Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. Ltd. in accordance with JIS K 6911 Japanese Industrial Standards . The procedure for measuring the surface resistivity will now be described with reference to .

The surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is determined as follows. The measurement sample indicated at T in is held between the electrode portions C and D of the first voltage applying electrode A and the insulating plate B with the outermost surface of the second conductive elastic layer facing upward. A voltage V V is then applied across the electrode portions C and D of the first voltage applying electrode A to measure the current I A that flows thereacross. The surface resistivity s sq is calculated by the following equation where d mm is the outer diameter of the cylindrical electrode portion C and D mm is the inner diameter of the ring electrode portion D.

In this exemplary embodiment the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is calculated from the current measured using a circular probe UR Probe for HIRESTA IP available from Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. Ltd. outer diameter of cylindrical electrode portion C 16 mm inner diameter of ring electrode portion D 30 mm outer diameter of ring electrode portion D 40 mm at 22 C. and 55 RH after a voltage of 500 V is applied for ten seconds.

The volume resistivity is measured using a circular probe e.g. UR Probe for HIRESTA IP available from Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. Ltd. in accordance with JIS K 6911. The procedure for measuring the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer will now be described with reference to .

The system and sample used for volume resistivity measurement are the same as for surface resistivity measurement except that the insulating plate B used for surface resistivity measurement of the circular probe illustrated in is replaced by a second voltage applying electrode B .

The measurement sample indicated at T in is held between the electrode portions C and D of the first voltage applying electrode A and the second voltage applying electrode B . A voltage V V is then applied across the cylindrical electrode portion C of the first voltage applying electrode A and the second voltage applying electrode B to measure the current I A that flows thereacross. The volume resistivity s cm of the measurement sample is calculated by the following equation 2.011 where t cm is the thickness of the measurement sample.

In this exemplary embodiment the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is calculated from the current measured using a circular probe UR Probe for HIRESTA IP available from Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. Ltd. outer diameter of cylindrical electrode portion C 16 mm inner diameter of ring electrode portion D 30 mm outer diameter of ring electrode portion D 40 mm at 22 C. and 55 RH after a voltage of 500 V is applied for ten seconds.

The coefficient 2.011 in the above equation is the electrode coefficient for conversion to resistivity and is calculated by d 10 4 from the outer diameter d mm of a cylindrical electrode portion. The thickness of the measurement sample is measured using a CTR 1500E eddy current type thickness meter available from Sanko Electronic Laboratory Co. Ltd.

The second conductive elastic layer contains for example a rubber elastomer and optionally a conductor and other additives. The second conductive elastic layer may be either a foamed conductive elastic layer or an unfoamed conductive elastic layer. If the second conductive elastic layer is provided by stretching a tubular elastic member in the radial direction as described later an unfoamed conductive elastic layer may be used to ensure sufficient strength.

The second conductive elastic layer is for example tensioned to come into close contact with the first conductive elastic layer . For example the tubular elastic member that forms the second conductive elastic layer is stretched in the radial direction but not in the longitudinal direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer .

The second conductive elastic layer formed by the tubular elastic member stretched in the radial direction may be anisotropic in conductivity i.e. may allow less current to flow in the planar direction than in the radial direction.

The second conductive elastic layer may be more anisotropic as the elongation of the tubular elastic member in the radial direction is higher. This may contribute to less discharge or leak current in the region around a nip formed by the transfer roller . A moderate elongation is desirable however to ensure sufficient strength.

The elongation of the tubular elastic member in the radial direction is preferably 50 to 100 or about 50 to about 100 more preferably 55 to 95 or about 55 to about 95 and most preferably 70 to 90 or about 70 to about 90 . This may ensure that the common logarithm of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is higher than the common logarithm of the volume resistivity by 1 or more or about 1 or more and that the second conductive elastic layer has sufficient strength.

The elongation of the tubular elastic member in the radial direction is calculated by the following equation Elongation 100 inner diameter after stretching inner diameter before stretching inner diameter before stretching

There is no upper limit on the difference between the common logarithms of the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer common logarithm of surface resistivity common logarithm of volume resistivity .

If for example the second conductive elastic layer is provided by stretching the tubular elastic member that forms the layer in the radial direction the difference between the common logarithms of the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer may be 3 or more to ensure sufficient strength.

The common logarithm of the volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is preferably 6 to 8 log cm more preferably 6.5 to 7.5 log cm which matches the preferred range of volume resistivity of the first conductive elastic layer . This may allow smooth charge transfer between the first conductive elastic layer and the second conductive elastic layer thus accumulating little charge therebetween. As a result the transfer roller may maintain its volume resistivity. If the transfer roller is applied to an image forming apparatus it may cause few image defects due to increased volume resistivity.

The volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is adjusted depending on for example the type and amount of conductor added.

The common logarithm of the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer which is higher than the common logarithm of the volume resistivity by 1 or more or about 1 or more is preferably 7 or more log sq . There is no upper limit on the surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer although it is preferably 10 or less log sq more preferably 9 or less log sq .

The surface resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer is adjusted depending on for example the type and amount of conductor added and the elongation of the tubular elastic member that forms the layer in the radial direction.

The thickness of the second conductive elastic layer may be for example 0.1 to 1 mm preferably 0.3 to 0.8 mm.

The rubber elastomer is for example an elastomer having at least a double bond in the chemical structure thereof. Examples of rubbers include those described for the first conductive elastic layer .

The conductor is optionally used particularly if the rubber has low or no conductivity. The conductor is for example an electron conductor or an ionic conductor. Examples of electron conductors and ionic conductors include those described for the first conductive elastic layer .

The second conductive elastic layer may be ionically conductive which allows the volume resistivity thereof to be easily controlled to the range of 6 to 8 log cm .

For example the rubber may be a mixture of epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide copolymer rubber or epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide allyl glycidyl ether copolymer rubber both of which are ionically conductive with another rubber such as polyurethane EPDM or NBR.

Another option is to impart ionic conductivity to a rubber having low or no conductivity by adding an ionic conductor in an amount of 0.1 to 5.0 parts by mass preferably 0.5 to 3.0 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the rubber.

The second conductive elastic layer is determined to be ionically conductive for example if the difference between the volume resistivity measured at high temperature and humidity and the volume resistivity measured at low temperature and humidity is 0.5 log cm or more or if the difference between the volume resistivity measured by applying a voltage of 100 V and the volume resistivity measured by applying a voltage of 1 000 V is 0.5 log cm or less.

Examples of other additives include materials that are commonly added to elastic layers such as foaming agents foaming aids softeners plasticizers curing agents vulcanizers vulcanization accelerators antioxidants surfactants coupling agents and fillers e.g. silica and calcium carbonate .

A method for manufacturing the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment will now be described.

The method begins with providing a roller member including the hollow or solid cylindrical conductive support shaft and the first conductive elastic layer disposed on the outer surface of the conductive support .

The second conductive elastic layer may be provided on the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer in any manner. For example the second conductive elastic layer may be provided on the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer by providing a tubular elastic member that forms the second conductive elastic layer and inserting the roller member into the elastic member.

The tubular elastic member that forms the second conductive elastic layer may be stretched to an elongation of 50 to 100 or about 50 to about 100 in the radial direction but not in the longitudinal direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer .

The tubular elastic member that forms the second conductive elastic layer may be manufactured in any manner. For example the tubular elastic member may be manufactured by extruding a mixture of a rubber and optionally a conductor and other additives through an extruder into a tubular member and vulcanizing the tubular member with heat.

An image forming apparatus according to this exemplary embodiment includes the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment.

Specifically the image forming apparatus according to this exemplary embodiment includes for example an image carrier a charging unit that charges a surface of the image carrier a latent image forming unit that forms a latent image on the charged surface of the image carrier a developing unit that develops the latent image formed on the surface of the image carrier with a toner to form a toner image and a transfer unit that transfers the toner image from the surface of the image carrier to a recording medium. The transfer unit includes the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment.

The transfer unit employs for example a direct transfer system or an intermediate transfer system. The direct transfer system includes a transfer roller alone. The intermediate transfer system includes an intermediate transfer member having a surface to which a toner image is transferred from the surface of the image carrier a first transfer roller that transfers the toner image from the surface of the image carrier to the surface of the intermediate transfer member and a second transfer roller that transfers the toner image from the surface of the intermediate transfer member to the recording medium.

A process cartridge according to this exemplary embodiment is for example attachable to and detachable from the above image forming apparatus. The process cartridge according to this exemplary embodiment includes at least the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment. Specifically the process cartridge according to this exemplary embodiment includes at least one unit selected from the group consisting of an image carrier a charging unit that charges a surface of the image carrier a latent image forming unit that forms a latent image on the charged surface of the image carrier and a developing unit that develops the latent image formed on the surface of the image carrier with a toner to form a toner image and a transfer unit that transfers the toner image from the surface of the image carrier to a recording medium. The transfer unit includes the transfer roller according to this exemplary embodiment.

The image forming apparatus according to this exemplary embodiment will now be described with reference to the drawings. is a schematic view of the image forming apparatus according to this exemplary embodiment.

The image forming apparatus illustrated in includes first to fourth electrophotographic image forming units Y M C and K that produce yellow Y magenta M cyan C and black K images respectively based on color separation image data. The image forming units hereinafter units Y M C and K are arranged in parallel at a particular spacing in the horizontal direction. The units Y M C and K may also be process cartridges attachable to and detachable from the image forming apparatus.

An intermediate transfer belt provided as an intermediate transfer member extends over the units Y M C and K in . The intermediate transfer belt is entrained about a drive roller and a support roller spaced apart from each other in the direction from the left to the right in and disposed in contact with the inner surface of the intermediate transfer belt . The transfer unit of the image forming apparatus is configured such that the intermediate transfer belt travels in the direction from the first unit Y toward the fourth unit K.

A spring not shown for example biases the support roller in the direction away from the drive roller to apply a particular tension to the intermediate transfer belt entrained about the two rollers and . An intermediate transfer member cleaning device is disposed opposite the drive roller on the image carrier side of the intermediate transfer belt .

The units Y M C and K include developing devices developing units Y M C and K respectively to which yellow magenta cyan and black toners can be supplied from toner cartridges Y M C and K respectively.

The first to fourth units Y M C and K have the same structure. The description herein will concentrate on the first unit Y which is located upstream in the travel direction of the intermediate transfer belt and which forms a yellow image. The elements of the second to fourth units M C and K corresponding to those of the first unit Y are designated by like numerals followed by M magenta C cyan and K black respectively rather than Y yellow and are not further described herein.

The first unit Y includes a photoreceptor Y that functions as an image carrier. The photoreceptor Y is surrounded by in sequence a charging roller Y that charges the surface of the photoreceptor Y to a particular potential an exposure device that exposes the charged surface to a laser beam Y based on a color separation image signal to form an electrostatic image a developing device developing unit Y that supplies a charged toner to the electrostatic image to develop the electrostatic image a first transfer roller first transfer unit Y that transfers the developed image to the intermediate transfer belt and a photoreceptor cleaning device cleaning unit Y that removes residual toner from the surface of the photoreceptor Y with a cleaning blade after the first transfer.

The first transfer roller Y is disposed opposite the photoreceptor Y inside the intermediate transfer belt . The first transfer rollers Y M C and K have connected thereto bias power supplies not shown that apply a first transfer bias thereto. A controller not shown controls the bias power supplies to change the transfer bias applied to the first transfer rollers Y M C and K.

The image forming operation of the first unit Y will now be described. Before the operation the charging roller Y charges the surface of the photoreceptor Y to a potential of about 600 to about 800 V.

The photoreceptor Y includes a conductive substrate having a volume resistivity at 20 C. of 1 10 cm or less and a photosensitive layer disposed on the substrate. The photosensitive layer which normally has high resistivity comparable to the resistivity of common resins has the property of changing its resistivity in a region irradiated with the laser beam Y. The exposure device directs the laser beam Y onto the charged surface of the photoreceptor Y based on yellow image data received from the controller not shown . The laser beam Y irradiates the photosensitive layer of the photoreceptor Y to form an electrostatic image with a yellow print pattern on the surface of the photoreceptor Y.

The electrostatic image is an image formed by the charge on the surface of the photoreceptor Y. Specifically the electrostatic image is a negative latent image formed on the surface of the photoreceptor Y after the charge dissipates from the region irradiated with the laser beam Y where the resistivity drops while remaining in the region not irradiated with the laser beam Y.

As the photoreceptor Y rotates the electrostatic image formed on the photoreceptor Y is brought to a particular development position where the electrostatic image is visualized developed by the developing device Y.

The developing device Y contains for example a yellow toner. The yellow toner is charged to the same polarity negative as the photoreceptor Y by friction as it is stirred inside the developing device Y. The charged yellow toner is carried by a developer roller developer carrier . As the surface of the photoreceptor Y passes through the developing device Y the yellow toner is electrostatically attracted to the latent image which is neutral on the surface of the photoreceptor Y. The yellow toner thus develops the latent image. The photoreceptor Y carrying the yellow toner image rotates at a particular speed to transport the toner image developed on the photoreceptor Y to a particular first transfer position.

When the yellow toner image on the photoreceptor Y is transported to the first transfer position a particular first transfer bias is applied to the first transfer roller Y. The toner image is transferred from the photoreceptor Y to the intermediate transfer belt by electrostatic force acting from the photoreceptor Y toward the first transfer roller Y. The transfer bias applied has the opposite polarity positive to the toner negative . The transfer bias is controlled to for example about 10 A in the first unit Y by the controller not shown .

The controller similarly controls the first transfer biases applied to the first transfer rollers M C and K of the second to fourth units M C and K.

Thus the intermediate transfer belt having the yellow toner image transferred thereto by the first unit Y is sequentially transported through the second to fourth units M C and K which superimpose toner images of the respective colors on top of each other.

The intermediate transfer belt having the toner images of the four colors superimposed thereon through the first to fourth units Y M C and K reaches a second transfer section. The second transfer section includes the intermediate transfer belt the support roller disposed in contact with the inner surface of the intermediate transfer belt and a second transfer roller second transfer unit disposed on the image carrier side of the intermediate transfer belt . A recording medium P is fed into a nip between the second transfer roller and the intermediate transfer belt at a particular timing by a feed mechanism. A particular second transfer bias is applied to the support roller . The transfer bias applied has the same polarity negative as the toner negative . The toner image is transferred from the intermediate transfer belt to the recording medium P by electrostatic force acting from the intermediate transfer belt toward the recording medium P. The second transfer bias is determined depending on the resistance detected by a resistance detector not shown that detects the resistance of the second transfer section and the voltage is controlled accordingly.

The recording medium P is transported to a fixing device fixing unit . The fixing device fixes the toner images to the recording medium P by fusing together the superimposed toner images with heat. The recording medium P having the color image fixed thereto is transported to an eject section. Thus the color image forming operation is complete.

While the illustrated image forming apparatus is configured to transfer the toner images via the intermediate transfer belt to the recording medium P it may be configured in any other manner. For example the image forming apparatus may be configured to directly transfer the toner images from the photoreceptors Y M C and K to the recording medium P.

The present invention is further illustrated by the following non limiting examples where parts are by mass unless otherwise indicated.

The coated roller 1 is inserted into the elastic tube 1 while blowing air therein. The elastic tube 1 is stretched to an elongation of 100.0 in the radial direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer.

The second conductive elastic layer of the transfer roller 1 is cut open into a sheet. The sheet is cut in the center thereof to form a 4 4 cm measurement sample.

The surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the measurement sample are measured by the procedures for measuring the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer described above. The common logarithms log sq of the measurements are shown in Table 1 below.

A transfer roller 2 is fabricated as in the fabrication of the transfer roller 1 except that the elastic tube 1 is replaced by the elastic tube 2. The elastic tube 2 is stretched to an elongation of 74.2 in the radial direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer.

The measurements of the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer are shown in Table 1 below.

A transfer roller 3 is fabricated as in the fabrication of the transfer roller 1 except that the elastic tube 1 is replaced by the elastic tube 3. The elastic tube 3 is stretched to an elongation of 54.3 in the radial direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer.

The measurements of the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer are shown in Table 1 below.

A transfer roller 4 is fabricated as in the fabrication of the transfer roller 1 except that the elastic tube 1 is replaced by the elastic tube 4. The elastic tube 4 is stretched to an elongation of 200.0 in the radial direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer.

The measurements of the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer are shown in Table 1 below.

After extended use the second conductive elastic layer is cracked and degraded much earlier than usual.

A transfer roller 5 is fabricated as in the fabrication of the transfer roller 1 except that the elastic tube 1 is replaced by the elastic tube 5. The elastic tube 5 is stretched to an elongation of 42.1 in the radial direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer.

The measurements of the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer are shown in Table 1 below.

A transfer roller 6 is fabricated as in the fabrication of the transfer roller 1 except that the elastic tube 1 is replaced by the elastic tube 6. The elastic tube 6 is stretched to an elongation of 22.7 in the radial direction to come into close contact with the outer surface of the first conductive elastic layer.

The measurements of the surface resistivity and volume resistivity of the second conductive elastic layer are shown in Table 1 below.

Measurement rollers are provided by removing the second conductive elastic layers from the transfer rollers of the Examples and the Comparative Examples. The volume resistivity is measured by the procedure for measuring the volume resistivity of the first conductive elastic layer described above. The length of the rollers in the axial direction is 350 mm and the nip width is 2 mm.

In all the Examples and the Comparative Examples the common logarithm of the volume resistance of the measurement roller is 5.9 log . In all the Examples and the Comparative Examples the common logarithm of the volume resistivity of the first conductive elastic layer is 6.9 cm.

The transfer rollers of the Examples and the Comparative Examples are mounted as a first transfer roller on an image forming apparatus based on DocuCentre II C6500 from Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd. modified such that the degree of pressing for forming a nip is adjustable .

The image forming apparatus is used to form images of characters lines and patches 100 50 halftone and 25 halftone in three different environments at 22 C. and 55 RH at 10 C. and 15 RH and at 28 C. and 85 RH on CA4 size paper from Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd. The test includes LED irradiation after development and before fixing as a stress.

The reproducibility of fine lines and dots is evaluated by observation at 50 magnification according to the following criteria. The results are shown in Table 1 below.

The results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that the transfer rollers of the Examples cause fewer image defects due to scattered toner during transfer than those of the Comparative Examples.
