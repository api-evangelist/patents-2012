This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 559 838 filed Nov. 15 2011 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 563 199 filed Nov. 23 2011 the entire contents of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Cyclosporin A is the active Ingredient in RESTASIS a topical ocular formulation approved in the United States for the treatment of dry eye. Topical cyclosporin is also used in the management of other ophthalmic conditions such as restoration of corneal sensitivity following refractive surgery conjunctival and corneal inflammation keratoconjuntivitis graft versus host disease post transplant glaucoma corneal transplants mycotic keratitis meibomian gland dysfunction Thygeson s superficial punctate keratitis uveitis and Theodore s superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.

Patient compliance is extremely important but many patients fail to comply with ocular medications. Moreover some treatments for conditions other than dry eye dose more frequently than the twice a day dosing approved for RESTASIS and concentrations of cyclosporin A higher in tissue than RESTASIS can deliver after multiple dosing would be beneficial to certain patients with severe conditions such as graft vs. host disease. Some ocular diseases may require long term therapy. For example the National Eye Institute NEI has completed a study to evaluate 1 and 2 mg biodegradable implants of cyclosporin to treat uveitis. The NEI is also studying the use of non degradable cyclosporin implants for treatment of graft vs. host disease. However it should be noted that removing non degradable implants after the dose has been depleted requires a second surgery. Some other relevant studies also have been conducted by the NEI or are in the process of recruiting patients for studies. Results for these NEI studies have not been published.

A single implantation or injection which delivers high levels of cyclosporin constantly over a long period weeks or months is desirable. The use of multi month biodegradable or bioerodible delivery system which delivers cyclosporin to targeted anterior ocular tissues at equal or greater concentration as RESTASIS is clearly desirable. It is also desirable to have an injectable formulation which would avoid surgery. A formulation which could pass through a 22 gauge needle or smaller and avoid the ocular tissue damage which may occur with trocars larger needles or surgical implantation is also desirable.

The reported success of injecting cyclosporin formulations into the conjunctiva for long duration therapy has been highly limited while short term efficacy has been shown with some microspheres and other formulations no formulation has been demonstrated to be equivalent or superior in delivering cyclosporin to anterior tissue when compared to RESTASIS for a period of at least 3 months.

Biodegradable implants which can be delivered through a 22 gauge needle do not deliver sufficient drug over a sufficient period of time to meet the need. Biodegradable gel forming suspensions perform better but still do not meet the need.

The inventors have surprisingly found that the formulations of the invention when delivered to the subconjunctival space of the eye through a 22 or smaller gauge needle deliver cyclosporin A to most anterior ocular tissue for a sustained period of time.

Cyclosporin A is known to exist in an amorphous form liquid crystal form tetragonal crystalline form form 1 and an orthorhombic form form 3 . A new crystalline form cyclosporin A form 2 has recently been discovered.

The XRPD pattern of CsA Form 2 differs significantly from the tetragonal form and orthorhombic form . The major crystalline peaks for CsA form 2 appear at 2 when scanned by an X ray diffractometer with X ray source as Cu K radiation 1.54 at 30 kV 15 mA 7.5 8.8 10.2 11.3 12.7 13.8 14.5 15.6 and 17.5 d spacing in crystal lattice at about 11.8 10.0 8.7 7.8 7.0 6.4 6.1 5.6 and 5.1 acute over respectively . These major peaks are defined as those being unique to Form 2 relative to the orthorhombic or tetragonal forms as well as peaks having an intensity greater than 5 times the background.

In one embodiment the new crystalline form Form 2 of CsA is a nonstoichiometric hydrate of Cyclosporin A. In another embodiment the crystalline Form 2 is represented by the formula 

Form 2 appears to be a kinetically stable form of CsA in aqueous suspensions. Suspensions containing Form 2 show no conversion to other known polymorphic or pseudomorphic forms upon storage. It has been found that Form 1 and the amorphous form convert to Form 2 in the presence of water.

The single crystal structure of the hydrate form of CsA Form 2 has been determined and the crystal structure parameters are listed in Table 2. These results indicate that Form 2 is unique compared to other known crystalline forms of cyclosporine A.

The asymmetric unit of this CsA Form 2 contains one cyclosporine A molecule and two water molecules. It is possible that any small molecule that can hydrogen bond to water could play the role of space filler which would give a range of potential structures running from the orthorhombic dihydrate to distorted monoclinic dihydrate The XRPD pattern calculated from the single crystal structure is shown in and it matches the experimental pattern shown in . These matching patterns further corroborate that Form 2 is a unique and pure crystalline form of cyclosporine A.

Without wishing to be bound by theory thermogravimetric analysis combined with KF titration and vapor sorption desorption analysis VSA suggest that CsA Form 2 is a non stoichiometric hydrate of CsA. The vapor sorption analysis of Cyclosporine Form 2 indicates that water content in the new crystal form reversibly varies with relative humidity as shown in . Similar to the tetragonal form the new CsA form undergoes a phase transition to a liquid crystal or amorphous form at 124.4 C. prior to melting as indicated by the modulated differential calorimetric MDSC analysis .

Cyclosporin A Form 2 may be obtained by suspending amorphous 0.05 cyclosporin A w v in 1 Polysorbate 80 heating the solution to 65 C. holding it at that temperature for 24 hours and then recovering the precipitate by vacuum filtration. One can then use the cyclosporin A Form 2 thus obtained to generate additional amounts using Cyclosporin A Form 2 as a seed crystal in this method one suspends about 30 g cyclosporin A in a solution of 900 ml water containing 1 w v Polysorbate 80 heats the solution to 65 C. and then seeds it with 0.2 g of cyclosporin A Form 2 at a temperature of 52 C. The solution is then stirred for about 22 hours at a temperature of between about 61 C. and 65 C. and then recovers the precipitate that results.

Further details regarding CsA Form 2 may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 480 710 the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.

Compositions of the invention are ophthalmically acceptable formulations of Cyclosporin A form 2. By ophthalmically acceptable the inventors mean that the suspensions are formulated in such a way as to be non irritating when administered to the eye of a mammal such as a human.

The formulations of the invention comprise cyclosporin A form 2 and a hydrogel such as hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl cellulose hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose hydroxyethylcellulose polyvinyl pyrolidone and carboxymethylcellulose.

In one embodiment the formulation comprises cyclosporin A form 2 at a concentration of about 0.001 to about 10 w v . In one embodiment the suspension comprises cyclosporin A form 2 at a concentration of about 0.001 w v to about 0.01 about 0.001 w v to about 0.04 w v about 0.001 w v to about 0.03 w v about 0.001 w v to about 0.02 w v or about 0.001 w v to about 0.01 w v . In another embodiment the suspension comprises cyclosporin A form 2 at a concentration of about 0.01 w v to about 0.05 about 0.01 w v to about 0.04 w v about 0.01 w v to about 0.03 w v about 0.01 w v to about 0.02 w v or about 0.01 w v to about 0.01 w v . In another embodiment the suspension comprises cyclosporin A form 2 at a concentration of about 0.01 w v to about 0.1 about 0.1 w v to about 0.5 w v about 0.01 w v to about 1 w v or about 1 w v to about 10 .

For example the formulations may comprise about 0.001 w v about 0.002 w v about 0.003 w v about 0.004 w v about 0.005 w v about 0.006 w v about 0.007 w v about 0.008 w v about 0.009 w v about 0.01 w v about 0.015 w v about 0.02 w v about 0.025 w v about 0.03 w v about 0.035 w v about 0.04 w v about 0.045 w v about 0.05 w v about 0.055 w v about 0.06 w v about 0.065 w v about 0.07 w v about 0.075 w v about 0.08 w v about 0.085 w v about 0.09 w v about 0.095 w v about 0.1 w v about 0.15 w v about 0.2 w v about 0.25 w v about 0.3 w v about 0.35 w v about 0.4 w v about 0.45 w v about 0.5 w v about 0.55 w v about 0.6 w v about 0.65 w v about 0.7 w v about 0.75 w v about 0.8 w v about 0.85 w v about 0.9 w v about 0.95 w v or about 1.0 w v cyclosporin A form 2.

Formulations of the invention may be used to treat any condition of the eye which is known to be amenable to topical treatment with cyclosporin A such as with RESTASIS at the concentrations stated here. For example compositions of the invention may be used to treat patients suffering from dry eye to treat blepharitis and meibomian gland disease to restore corneal sensitivity that has been impaired due to refractive surgery on the eye to treat allergic conjunctivitis and atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis and to treat ptyregia conjunctival and corneal inflammation keratoconjuntivitis graft versus host disease post transplant glaucoma corneal transplants mycotic keratitis Thygeson s superficial punctate keratitis uveitis and Theodore s superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis among other conditions.

The International Dry Eye Workshop DEWS defines dry eye as a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort visual disturbance and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface. It includes those conditions such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca that are caused by tear deficiency or excessive evaporation of tears.

Blepharitis is a chronic disorder producing inflammation of the anterior and posterior lid margin with involvement of skin and its related structures hairs and sebaceous glands the mucocutaneous junction and the meibomian glands. It can also affect the conjunctiva tear film and the corneal surface in advanced stages and may be associated with dry eye. Blepharitis is commonly classified into anterior or posterior blepharitis with anterior affecting the lash bearing region of the lids and posterior primarily affecting the meibomian gland orifices.

Meibomian gland disease most often occurs as one of three forms primary meibomitis secondary meibomitis and meibomian seborrhea. Meibomian seborrhea is characterized by excessive meibomian secretion in the absence of inflammation hypersecretory meibomian gland disease . Primary meibomitis by contrast is distinguished by stagnant and inspissated meibomian secretions obstructive hypersecretory meibomian gland disease . Secondary meibomitis represents a localized inflammatory response in which the meibomian glands are secondarily inflamed in a spotty fashion from an anterior lid margin blepharitis.

Impaired corneal sensitivity often occurs after refractive surgery such as photorefractive keratectomy laser assisted sub epithelium keratomileusis LASEK EPI LASEK customized transepithelial non contact ablation or other procedures in which the corneal nerves are severed. Impaired corneal sensitivity may also occur after viral infection such as by HSV 1 HSV 2 and VZV viruses. Patients with impaired corneal sensitivity often complain that their eyes feel dry even though tear production and evaporation may be normal suggesting that dryness in such patients is actually a form of corneal neuropathy that results when corneal nerves are severed by surgery or inflamed after viral infection.

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva resulting from hypersensitivity to one or more allergens. It may be acute intermittent or chronic. It occurs seasonally that is at only certain time of the year or it occurs perennially that is chronically throughout the year. Symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis include in addition to inflammation of the conjunctiva lacrimation tearing conjunctival vascular dilation itching papillary hyperlasia chemosis eyelid edema and discharge from the eye. The discharge may form a crust over the eyes after a night s sleep.

Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic severe form of allergic conjunctivitis that often leads to visual impairment. Symptoms include itching burning pain redness foreign body sensation light sensitivity and blurry vision. There is often a discharge especially on awakening from a night s sleep the discharge may be stringy ropy and mucoid. The lower conjunctiva is often more prominently affected than the upper conjunctiva. The conjunctiva may range from pale edematous and featureless to having the characteristics of advanced disease including papillary hypertrophy subepithelial fibrosis formix foreshortening trichiasis entropion and madurosis. In some patients the disease progresses to punctate epithelial erosions corneal neovascularization and other features of keratopathy which may impair vision. There is typically goblet cell proliferation in the conjunctiva epithelial pseudotubular formation and an increased number of degranulating eosinophils and mast cells in the epithelium. CD25 T lymphocytes macrophages and dendritic cells HLA DR.sup. HLA CD1 are significantly elevated in the substantia propria.

Like atopic keratoconjunctivitis vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a severe form of allergic conjunctivitis but it tends to affect the upper conjunctiva more prominently than the lower. It occurs in two forms. In the palpebral form square hard flattened closely packed papillae are present in the bulbar limbal form the circumcorneal conjunctiva becomes hypertrophied and grayish. Both forms are often accompanied by a mucoid discharge. Corneal epithelium loss may occur accompanied by pain and photophobia as may central corneal plaques and Trantas dots.

Formulations of the invention are administered to the subconjunctival space. As used herein the subconjunctival space refers to any of the following 1 the potential space between the bulbar conjunctiva and Tenon s capsule and extending from the limbus to the formix 2 the potential space between the palpebral conjunctiva and the tarsus and extending from the eye lid margin mucocutaneous junction of the eyelid to the formix and 3 the potential space just beneath the formiceal conjunctiva at the junctional bay or formix. The subconjunctival space is therefore the potential space just beneath the conjunctiva from the limbus around the formix to the eye lid margin.

Referring to the subconjunctival space around the eye can be divided into four quadrants the superior nasal inferior and temporal. These quadrants may be further subdivided into sub quadrants such as the superotemporal superonasal inferior nasal and inferior temporal and so on. Hence the formulations of the invention may be administered for example to the superotemporal quadrant of the bulbar subconjunctival space or to any one or more of the inferior superior nasal or temporal quadrants of the bulbar palpepral or formiceal subconjunctival spaces or to the superotemporal superonasal inferior temporal or inferior nasal bulbar palpepral or formiceal subconjunctival spaces . Therefore unless further delimited administration into the subconjunctival space of the eye refers to administration into any of the bulbar palpepral and or formiceal subconjunctival spaces in the eye in any one or more of the four quadrants of the eye superior nasal temporal and inferior or any one or more of the possible sub quadrants of the eye including the supertemporal superonasal inferior temporal or inferior nasal regions of the bulbar palpepral or formiceal subconjunctival spaces.

In one embodiment administration of the formulations of the invention excludes their topical delivery such as by eye drops to the surface of the eye or more specifically the cornea since the subconjunctival space does not include any region or space immediately over under or within the cornea. In another embodiment administration to the subconjunctival space further excludes a delivery method that penetrates or perforates Tenon s capsule or the sclera that penetrates or extends through the sclera into the vitreous body or that is delivered beneath the sclera. The subconjunctival space as used herein is not equivalent to the sub tenon space. Tenon s capsule is a thin fibrous somewhat elastic membrane beneath the conjunctiva that envelopes the eyeball from the edge of the cornea limbus to the optic nerve. It attaches loosely to the sclera. Thus the sub tenon space is between Tenon s capsule and the sclera. Sub tenon administration of a composition to an eye generally involves elevating both the conjunctiva and Tenons capsule using forceps and then introducing the composition into the space between the sclera and Tenon s capsule. A needle and syringe may be used to pierce Tenon s capsule and inject the composition into the sub tenon space.

In one embodiment the device for administering the formulations of the invention to the subconjunctival space of an eye is a syringe equipped with a needle or a cannula. The needle or cannula used to inject a ophthalmic composition into the subconjunctival space of an eye can be a 20 gauge or higher gauge needle or cannula. The needle or cannula may have a blunt or beveled end. In preferred embodiments the gauge of the needle or cannula used in the method is a 25 gauge or higher needle or cannula or is specifically a 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 or 34 gauge needle or cannula.

In one embodiment of the present method for treating an ocular surface inflammation or inflammation of the ocular surface adnexa in a subject in need thereof a formulation of the invention is injected into the subconjunctival space of the eye i.e. administered according to the following procedure. With the subject facing the practitioner the practitioner uses a thumb or device such as forceps to retract the upper or lower eye lid depending on whether injection into the subconjunctival space is to take place in the superior e.g. superotemporal or inferior quadrants respectively. See for example. With the other hand the practitioner positions the needle attached to a syringe containing the composition tangential to the eye globe with the needle bevel facing toward the globe i.e. with the needle bevel facing down . In certain instances it may be preferable to orient the needle with the bevel facing up i.e. away from the globe . Keeping the needle tangential to the globe and using a gentle stabbing motion the practitioner then directs the needle posteriorly and just beneath the conjunctiva to introduce the needle into the subconjunctival space. The desired volume of composition is then injected into the subconjunctival space. Depending on the volume injected the composition may appear as an elevation or small bulge in the conjunctiva. The needle is then withdrawn. Pressure may then be applied to the eye with a gauze pad to help distribute and diffuse the composition and stem possible bleeding.

In certain embodiments the same procedure may be used to introduce anesthetic into the subconjunctival space of the eye prior to injecting the formulation of the invention. The anesthetic solution may appear as an elevation or bulge in the conjunctiva. If this procedure is followed and once the anesthetic has taken effect the composition is then injected into the elevated portion of the conjunctiva but at a site other than that used to inject the anesthetic. In some embodiments an additional dose of formulation of the invention may be injected into the nasal and or inferior e.g. the inferior formiceal subconjunctival space using the same procedure outlined above.

Alternatively an ocular anesthetic may be applied topically to one or each eye prior to injection of the composition into the subconjunctival space of the eye. Analgesic agents may also be administered following subconjunctival administration of the composition. Analgesic agents include triple antibiotic ointment or atropine drops or ointment.
