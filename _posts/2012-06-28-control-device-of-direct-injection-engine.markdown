The present invention relates to a control device of an engine that is installed on a vehicle etc. and in particular to a control device of a direct injection engine the control device that is provided with an injector directly injecting fuel into a cylinder a combustion chamber and performs idle stop to stop the engine temporarily when the engine and a vehicle equipped with the engine are in a state in which the engine and the vehicle satisfy a predetermined condition.

In recent years from the viewpoint of environmental conservation vehicles automobiles have been expected to achieve a reduction of combustion waste gas exhaust gas which turns into greenhouse gas and a reduction of carbon monoxide CO hydrocarbon HC nitrogen oxides NOx etc. which are contained in the combustion waste gas exhaust gas these reductions are referred to as an improvement in exhaust performance and a reduction of fuel consumption an improvement in fuel efficiency and a direct injection engine that makes an injector directly perform fuel injection into a combustion chamber of each cylinder has been developed to achieve primarily improvements in exhaust performance and fuel efficiency and an improvement in engine output.

Moreover a vehicle with an idle stop function of performing idle stop to stop an engine temporarily when the engine and a vehicle equipped with the engine are in a state in which the engine and the vehicle satisfy a predetermined condition for example a state in which the vehicle stops at a red light and then restarting the engine by driving a starter upon a restart request to achieve further improvements in fuel efficiency and exhaust performance has also been put to practical use and come into wide use.

Various techniques related to idle stop engine stop and restarting in a vehicle equipped with a direct injection engine have been proposed. For example JP A 2010 236546 proposes a technique of determining whether or not a stop position of a piston of a certain cylinder is a stop position in which compression injection combustion can be performed and starting fuel injection when the piston stop position in the cylinder is a specific position in which compression injection combustion can be performed.

Moreover for example JP A 2007 23815 proposes a technique of making a compression stroke cylinder inject fuel and ignite the fuel when a restart request is made before an engine rotation is stopped after an idle stop condition is satisfied and the engine rotation speed at that time is higher than a predetermined value and making the compression stroke cylinder and an expansion stroke cylinder inject fuel and ignite the fuel when the engine rotation speed is lower than the predetermined value.

As described above in recent years in a direct injection engine that is installed on a vehicle with an idle stop function various restarting techniques to achieve primarily improvements in fuel efficiency and exhaust performance have been proposed. To achieve further improvements in fuel efficiency and exhaust performance the number of times an idle stop engine stop condition is satisfied is increasing and a restarting technique used when a restart request is made based on for example the driver s intention before the engine rotation is stopped becomes more important.

A restart request before the engine rotation is stopped after an idle stop engine stop condition is satisfied is determined by the driver s intention. However various piston positions at the time of issuance of the restart request and combustion at the time of extremely low rotation result in unstable combustion and eventually an increase in the amount of emission of soot caused by misfire and poor exhaust performance if an appropriate fuel injection injection start timing and injection time injection quantity is not performed.

In view of the problems mentioned above it is an object of the present invention to provide a control device of a direct injection engine the control device that can perform appropriate fuel injection in accordance with the piston position of each cylinder when a restart request is made before an engine is stopped after an idle stop condition is satisfied and can prevent the amount of emission of soot from increasing and the exhaust performance from worsening.

To achieve the above object in accordance with an aspect of the invention a control device of a direct injection engine includes an injector directly injecting fuel into a combustion chamber and performs idle stop to stop an engine temporarily when the engine and a vehicle equipped with the engine are in a state in which the engine and the vehicle satisfy a predetermined condition and when a restart request is made before the engine is stopped after the idle stop condition is satisfied at least one of the number of fuel injections in one combustion cycle and the air fuel ratio of an air fuel mixture used for combustion is changed for each cylinder according to a piston position at that time.

In the control device of the direct injection engine according to the aspect of the invention when a restart request is made before the engine is stopped after an idle stop engine stop condition is satisfied at least one of the number of fuel injections in one combustion cycle and the air fuel ratio of an air fuel mixture used for combustion is changed for each cylinder according to a piston position at that time in other words an optimum restart combustion mode is determined by the performance of a computation and is selected according to a piston position at that time. This makes it possible to achieve stable combustion and improvements in exhaust performance and fuel efficiency.

A direct injection engine shown in the drawing is for example an in line four cylinder gasoline engine having four cylinders and . The air that is supplied to a combustion chamber of each cylinder is taken in through an inlet of an air cleaner passes by an air flow sensor passes through a throttle body in which an electrically controlled throttle valve is housed and then enters a collector . The air sucked into the collector is distributed among outlets of an intake manifold a manifold the outlets connected to the cylinders and is then guided to the combustion chamber formed above a piston through an induction valve .

From the air flow sensor a signal indicating the intake air mass is output to an engine control unit forming a principal portion of the control device of the embodiment of the invention. Furthermore to the throttle body a throttle sensor detecting the degree of opening of the electrically controlled throttle valve is attached and a signal indicating the degree of opening of the electrically controlled throttle valve is also output to the engine control unit .

On the other hand fuel such as gasoline is supplied from a fuel tank to an injector provided in each cylinder through an accumulator hereinafter referred to as a common rail after being subjected to primary pressurization by a low pressure fuel pump so that the pressure thereof is adjusted to a constant pressure for example 0.3 MPa by a fuel pressure regulator and subjected to secondary pressurization so that the pressure thereof becomes a higher pressure for example 5 MPa or 10 MPa by a high pressure fuel pump which will be described later and is directly injected from the injector into the combustion chamber . The air fuel mixture of the fuel injected into the combustion chamber and the intake air is ignited by a spark of a spark plug to which an ignition signal whose voltage has been raised by an ignition coil and causes explosive combustion to occur and the combustion waste gas exhaust gas is discharged to the outside via an exhaust valve through an exhaust passage in which an exhaust purification catalyst a three way catalyst is provided. Incidentally in this embodiment the injector adopts a side injection method by which the fuel is injected from the suction side of the engine however the injector may adopt a center injection method by which the fuel is injected from right above the combustion chamber

A crank angle sensor attached on a crank shaft of the engine outputs a signal indicating the rotational position of the crank shaft to the engine control unit .

Moreover the engine is provided with a suction side variable valve mechanism that can vary the opening and closing timing of the induction valve and an exhaust side variable valve mechanism that can vary the opening and closing timing of the exhaust valve . A cam angle sensor attached to a cam shaft not shown of the exhaust side variable valve mechanism outputs an angular signal indicating the rotational position of the exhaust cam shaft to the engine control unit and also outputs an angular signal indicating the rotational position of a pump drive cam of the high pressure fuel pump the pump drive cam rotating with the rotation of the exhaust cam shaft to the engine control unit . Based on the signals from the crank angle sensor and the cam angle sensor a computation is performed to determine the stroke of each cylinder in one combustion cycle an intake stroke a compression stroke an expansion stroke and an exhaust stroke and a piston position for example an angle at which the piston is located the angle before the T.D.C in the compression stroke in terms of a crank angle .

Furthermore a starter drives and rotates the crank shaft by a drive signal from the engine control unit .

The high pressure fuel pump pressurizes the fuel from the fuel tank and pressure feeds the high pressure fuel to the common rail .

The fuel is guided to a fuel feed port of a pump main body by the low pressure fuel pump after being adjusted by the pressure regulator so that the pressure of the fuel becomes a constant pressure. On the fuel feed port side a high pressure pump control valve which is a normally closed electromagnetic valve solenoid valve for controlling the fuel intake is provided. The high pressure pump control valve closes in the non energized state and opens in the energized state.

The high pressure pump control valve is controlled by the engine control unit to adjust the discharge rate of the fuel supplied by the low pressure fuel pump and thereby control the fuel pressure inside the common rail. The fuel is pressurized by the pump drive cam and in a pressurizing chamber and is pressure fed to the common rail through a fuel exhaust port. In the fuel exhaust port a discharge valve is provided to prevent backflow of the high pressure fuel on the downstream side to the pressurizing chamber. To the common rail the injectors and a pressure sensor for measuring the fuel pressure inside the common rail are attached.

In block based on the information obtained from the key switch the accelerator sensor the brake switch the vehicle speed sensor etc. it is determined whether or not restart after an idle stop engine stop condition is satisfied is permitted and it is also determined whether or not a restart request is a restart request made before the engine rotation is stopped after the idle stop condition is satisfied. If a restart request is a restart request made before the engine is stopped that is a restart request made while the engine is rotating a flag F indicating restart while the engine is rotating hereinafter referred to as an engine rotating restart flag F is set to 1 is turned ON .

The processing shown in as a flowchart is interrupt processing and is repeatedly performed at intervals of 10 ms for example. First in step it is determined whether fuel cut for idle stop is performed or not. Then in step it is determined whether a restart request is made or not based on the information obtained from the accelerator sensor etc. If a restart request is made the procedure proceeds to step and it is determined whether the engine is rotating or not. If the engine is rotating since it can be determined that a restart request is made before the engine is stopped after the idle stop condition is satisfied an engine rotating restart flag F indicating that the restart request is a restart request made while the engine is rotating is set to 1 in step .

In block a computation is performed to determine a target fuel pressure a boosted voltage value to be attained and the high pressure fuel pump is driven in block in such a way as to attain the target fuel pressure. The fuel pressure is boosted to accelerate atomization of the fuel to improve combustion ensure atomization time by reducing an injection period for a restart request which may be made in the latter period of a compression stroke and raise an upper limit of the number of split injections by reducing the injection time. To raise the fuel pressure the target fuel pressure of high pressure fuel pump control is changed to a higher value.

Here the injector has the following characteristics. Under the same injection pulse width condition the higher the fuel pressure the larger the injection quantity becomes. Moreover for the injection pulse width the injection quantity has the following characteristics. In a region in which the injection pulse width is a given injection pulse width or more the linearity is maintained when the injection pulse width becomes an injection pulse width which is less than a given injection pulse width the injection quantity becomes unstable. For this reason a lower limit that can be used as an injection pulse width is limited to a minimum value at which the linearity is maintained. In the relationship between the fuel pressure and the injection pulse width corresponding to the injection time when the fuel injection quantity of the injector is constant is shown. When the fuel pressure rises the injection pulse width is reduced. At this time the target fuel pressure is set in such a way that the injection pulse width does not fall below the minimum value at which the injection quantity of the injector is stable the linearity is maintained .

To raise the fuel pressure in a short period to a time point at which the engine is stopped the high pressure pump is brought into a full discharge state when the engine rotating restart flag F becomes 1.

In block based on the signals obtained from the crank angle sensor and the cam angle sensor a piston position in each cylinder at that point in time when the engine rotating restart flag F became 1 is determined and an optimum restart combustion mode for that piston position is determined by the performance of a computation and is selected for each cylinder.

The processing shown in as a flowchart is interrupt processing and is repeatedly performed at intervals of 10 ms for example. First in step it is determined whether the engine rotating restart flag F is 1 or not that is the restart request is a restart request made before the engine is stopped made while the engine is rotating . If the restart request is a restart request made while the engine is rotating if the flag F is 1 the procedure proceeds to step . If the restart request is not a restart request made while the engine is rotating if the flag F is not 1 the procedure goes back to the start. In step based on the signals from the crank angle sensor and the cam angle sensor the piston position of each cylinder is calculated. When the piston position is in the latter period of the compression stroke it is determined in step that the piston position is region and a restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 1 step . When the piston position is in the middle period of the compression stroke it is determined in step that the piston position is region and the restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 2 step . When the piston position is in the middle period of the intake stroke to the early period of the compression stroke it is determined in step that the piston position is region and the restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 3 step . When the piston position is in the early period of the intake stroke the restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 4 in step . The ranges of the regions and differ from one another depending on the combustion performance of the engine. Moreover since the piston positions of the cylinders when the restart request is made differ from one another in the case of four cylinders the piston positions of the cylinders are displaced crank degrees with respect to one another the restart combustion mode ISREST is determined for each cylinder by the performance of a computation.

In the relationship among the piston position the regions and and the restart combustion mode is shown.

When the piston position is the region the latter period of the compression stroke the restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 1. In this case injection of the fuel is started immediately when the restart combustion mode ISREST is confirmed to be 1 almost as soon as the piston position is calculated or the restart request is made . Therefore a restart initial injection time point injection start timing is in the latter period of the compression stroke in the region to ensure atomization time. Moreover to prevent emission of soot fuel spraying is stratified and the fuel injection quantity is set so that the air fuel ratio of the air fuel mixture used for combustion is leaner than the stoichiometric mixture ratio.

When the piston position is the region the middle period of the compression stroke the restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 2. Also in this case injection of the fuel is started immediately when the restart combustion mode ISREST is confirmed to be 2 almost as soon as the piston position is calculated or the restart request is made . Therefore a restart initial injection time point injection start timing is in the middle period of the compression stroke in the region to ensure atomization time. Moreover performing fuel injection more than once in one combustion cycle performing split injection achieves a higher degree of mixing of fuel and air in the combustion chamber and ensures the concentration of air fuel mixture necessary for ignition timing. In an example of split injection is shown. Here an example in which four injections in total two injections performed in the middle period of the compression stroke and two injections performed in the latter period of the compression stroke in the region four stage injection are performed is shown.

When the piston position is the region the middle period of the intake stroke to the early period of the compression stroke the restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 3. Also in this case injection of the fuel is started immediately when the restart combustion mode ISREST is confirmed to be 3 almost as soon as the piston position is calculated or the restart request is made . Therefore a restart initial injection time point injection start timing is in the middle period of the intake stroke to the early period of the compression stroke in the region to ensure atomization time. The beginning of the region in which ISREST 3 is set at injection timing best injection timing at which the best combustion performance is achieved at the time of injection in the intake stroke.

When the piston position is the region the region other than the regions and the restart combustion mode ISREST is set to 4. In the region in which the restart combustion mode ISREST 4 fuel injection is performed according to the best injection timing which corresponds to the beginning of the region in which ISREST 3.

Unlike a case in which restart is carried out after the engine is completely stopped the combustion robustness of initial injection performed when restart is carried out before the engine is stopped while the engine is rotating is increased by the performance of appropriate stratification and split injection according to the piston position as in this embodiment due to the presence of the flow of air and an appropriate compression pressure in the combustion chamber. This makes it possible to prevent the amount of emission of soot from increasing and the exhaust performance from worsening.

In blocks to of injection start timing an injection pulse width corresponding to the injection quantity ignition timing and a target throttle opening appropriate for the above described restart combustion mode ISREST are determined by the performance of a computation and in blocks to control of driving of the injectors the ignition coils and the electrically controlled throttle valve is performed.

Next with reference to the effects of the embodiment of the invention will be described based on a comparison between the embodiment of the invention and an existing example. are time charts showing changes in the behaviors of individual portions when the piston position of a certain cylinder is the region the middle period of the compression stroke when a restart request is made before the engine is stopped while the engine is rotating after the idle stop condition is satisfied.

In the existing example shown in one injection is performed at low fuel pressure in a compression stroke. Therefore atomization time is not ensured and appropriate stratification is not performed which may lead to unstable combustion. This results in poor engine start up performance and an increase in soot emission and HC.

In this embodiment an improvement in combustion itself in the compression stroke at the time of restart is obtained and the number of possible split injections is increased by increasing the fuel pressure after the idle stop condition is satisfied. Moreover split injection which is an optimum combustion mode is adopted. This improves restart performance and prevents an increase in soot emission and HC.

That is in the embodiment of the invention an optimum restart combustion mode is selected according to the piston position of each cylinder when a restart request is made before the engine is stopped after the idle stop engine stop condition is satisfied. This makes it possible to achieve stable combustion and improvements in exhaust performance and fuel efficiency.

While the embodiment of the invention has been described in detail the invention is not limited to the embodiment described above and various changes can be made in the design thereof without departing from the spirit of the invention recited in the appended claims.
