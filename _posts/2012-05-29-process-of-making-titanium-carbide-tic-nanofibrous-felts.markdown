The present invention claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61 495 706 filed Jun. 10 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention was partially supported by the Department of Energy under Grant Number DE FG02 08ER64624. The U.S. government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to the preparation of electrospun TiC nanofibers and nano ribbons as well as their overlaid mats felts theses felts can be further treated through chlorination at elevated temperature for the preparation of carbide derived carbon CDC with high porosity enhanced capacitance and other desirable electrochemical properties.

Titanium carbide TiC has a high melting point hardness and wear resistance. Therefore it has been used for preparations of cermets cutting tool tips and wear resistant coatings. Recently TiC has attracted attention as a precursor for developing porous carbonaceous materials with pore sizes on the order of a few nanometers. Such materials are called carbide derived carbon CDC . The synthesis of CDC is based upon selective removal of the Ti metal from a metal carbide. For example the Ti can be removed from TiC using chlorine Cb gas at elevated temperatures.

Large pore volumes together with the concomitant high specific surface areas make CDC useful in applications including catalyst support gas storage and super capacitors. In addition such materials have superior thermal conductivity and can therefore also be used as phase change materials in thermal energy systems.

To date however nano scale TiC materials are only available as particles powders and thin films. Thus no one has yet devised a system for making continuous TiC nanofibers or nano fibrous felts formed from such nanofibers. As will be shown the present invention provides exactly such a system.

The present invention provides a system for electrospinning nanofibers or nano ribbons with TiC crystallites embedded in carbon matrix and for overlaying these fibers to produce a fibrous mat felt . This fiber mat felt can then be chlorinated at high temperatures to remove the Ti resulting in a CDC nano fibrous felt having high specific surface area and excellent electro capacitance properties.

In accordance with one preferred aspect of the present invention titanium IV n butoxide TiBO Aldrich catalogue number 244112 and furfuryl alcohol FA Aldrich catalogue number 185930 were selected as the titanium and carbon sources respectively. In accordance with the present invention electrospinning a spin dope containing TiBO and FA resulting in a uniform dispersion of titanium and carbon was followed by carbothermal reduction to produce nanofibers or nano ribbons with TiC crystallites embedded in carbon matrix. After chlorination treatment the resulting CDC nano felt formed by overlaying the nanofibers or nano ribbons comprises a disordered and extremely porous carbon as the fiber ribbon matrix.

The nano felts that are provided by the present nanofibers or nano ribbons being placed together over top of one another have many advantages. For example the present nano felts are mechanically flexible and resilient. As such they can potentially be used as an electrode material for a super capacitor application without the addition of any binder. Such binders are typically required to fabricate electrodes from powders . Unfortunately such binders significantly reduce the device performance to both increased resistance and the addition of dead weight.

Yet another potential application of the present nano felts is in catalysis applications. TiC is a catalyst for the oxidation of hydrogen H gas additionally the TiC nano felts with meso porous morphological structure the specific surface area being approximately 400 m g can be further impregnated with platinum or other catalyst clusters and or nanoparticles for catalysis applications particularly in fuel cells .

In accordance with the present invention continuous nanofibers or nano ribbons with TiC crystallites embedded in carbon matrix have been synthesized via electrospinning followed by pyrolysis i.e. carbothermal reduction . These nanofibers can be further treated with Clgas to be converted into TiC CDC nanofibers.

In one preferred aspect the present method was performed and demonstrated that electrospinning of a spin dope containing titanium IV n butoxide TiBO Aldrich catalogue number 244112 and furfuryl alcohol FA Aldrich catalogue number 185930 resulted in nanofibers having a uniform dispersion of titanium and carbon sources. The carbothermal reduction of these nanofibers then resulted in continuous nanofibers with TiC crystallites embedded in carbon matrix. These nanofibers were overlayed onto one another resulting in a mechanically resilient nano felt having excellent electrochemical properties.

The first step in the present method was to synthesize TiC. In general TiC can be synthesized by precursors containing Ti and C. In accordance with one preferred aspect of the present invention titanium IV n butoxide TiBO Aldrich catalogue number 244112 and furfuryl alcohol FA Aldrich catalogue number 185930 were selected as the titanium and carbon sources respectively. It is to be understood however that other methods of synthesizing the TiC are also contemplated within the scope of the present invention.

For example although chemical vapor deposition can be used to prepare TiC another preferred method is to use a high temperature reaction between the two precursors containing the Ti and C separately. Suitable titanium precursors include Ti metal TiCland TiO. Suitable carbon precursors include CH CCl CHand CaC. A carbothermal reduction using TiOand carbon black activated carbon carbon film or cellulose can also be used. The use of titanium alkoxide and organic polymeric materials as the source has also been explored.

The second step in the present method was to electrospin nanofibers. To prepare the spin dope for electrospinning polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP Aldrich number 437190 was selected as the carrying polymer N N dimethylformamide DMF Aldrich catalogue number 227056 was selected as the solvent and acetic acid HAc Aldrich catalogue number 537020 was added into the spin dope as the catalyst for hydrolysis of TiBO and polymerization of FA. It is to be understood however that the present invention is not so limited and that other suitable chemicals may be used when preparing the spin dope.

Moreover although numerous spin dopes and preparation procedures were investigated the preferred one was a spin dope containing 10 wt TiBO 10 wt FA 10 wt PVP and 2.5 wt HAc. DMF was used as a solvent for this preparation. Again it is to be understood that other compositions and preparations may also be used all keeping within the scope of the present invention. The spin dope was then magnetically stirred for 48 hours. Next a plastic syringe was filled with the spin dope for the electrospinning. The electrospinning setup included an ES 30P high voltage power supply an 18 gauge needle with a 90 blunt tip. An electrically grounded roller was placed 10 inches below the needle tip. 15 kV were applied to the needle and a feed rate of 1.0 ml h was maintained using a KDS 200 syringe pump. The roller was rotated at 100 rpm.

The resulting electrospun precursor nanofibers were collected as an overlaid nanofiber mat on a sheet of aluminum foil that covered the roller. The nanofiber mat was then kept under ambient conditions for 4 days to allow for completion of the chemical reactions inside the nanofibers.

The third step in the present method was heating pyrolysis. But first after the electrospun nanofibers were collected on the aluminum foil the nanofibers were peeled off of the aluminum foil transferred into a ceramic foil and then placed into a Lindberg 54453 Heavy Duty Tube Furnace for pyrolysis i.e. carbothermal reduction .

In one preferred aspect of the present method pyrolysis was accomplished by 1 increasing the temperature at 5 C. min from about 25 C. to 325 C. 2 holding the temperature at 325 C. for 6 hours 3 increasing the temperature at 5 C. min to 1400 C. 4 holding the temperature at 1400 C. for 12 hours and then 5 allowing the material to cool to room temperature. A constant flow of argon gas was maintained through the furnace during this heat treatment.

It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses many different heat treatments in addition to the exemplary one described above. Temperatures and durations may be varied. Moreover as will be discussed herein different heat treatments resulted in nanofelts having different shapes structures and physical properties. As such the present invention covers any suitable high temperature pyrolysis treatments.

The fourth step in the present method was to expose the electrospun TiC nanofibers to Clgas i.e. chlorination . The chlorination of TiC was governed by the following equation TiC 2Cl TiCl C. It was found that chlorination effectively extracts Ti from the nanofiber mats i.e. felts while the overall morphologies of the nanofibrous felts can be well reserved i.e. the transformation is conformal with trace amounts of un reacted nano TiC found only in the nano felt chlorinated at lower temperatures e.g. at 200 C. It is noteworthy that the chlorination treatment is carried out after the TiC nano felts have been prepared particularly for the application of super capacitor for other applications such as catalysis the TiC nano felts can be utilized directly without the chlorination treatment.

Both the resulting electrospun precursor nanofibers and the final TiC nanofibers that made up the nano felt were examined by Scanning Electron Microscope SEM and X ray Diffraction XRD . The following properties were found.

However it was experimentally determined that if the nanofibers were instead initially prepared at 425 C. not 325 C. then they displayed a cylindrical shape. It is thus believed that the partial decomposition of PVP at 325 C. resulted in the increase in surface roughness. However the relatively fast heating rate of 5 C. min following carbothermal reduction likely prevented the partially decomposed PVP from completely decomposing before it became very rubbery. This resulted in the flattening of the fibers and the formation of ribbons.

As can also be seen in low magnification and D high magnification the final TiC nanofibers and or nano ribbons have tiny crystallite particles on their surfaces. High resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM confirmed that the crystallites had sizes ranging from 5 nm to 30 nm and that they were randomly distributed in an amorphous matrix. shows a high resolution TEM image in which crystallites areas 1 2 and 3 were highly ordered single crystals whereas crystallites areas 4 5 and 6 contained defects and amorphous regions.

After selective removal of Ti through Cltreatment at an elevated temperature an extremely porous CDC nanofiber nano ribbon morphology was developed. In preferred aspects the fibers have graphitic carbon ribbons embedded therein in a highly disordered carbon matrix. Graphitic carbon is preserved from the TiC nanofibers where a few graphene layers surround the TiC nanocrystallites.

It is believed that the following reactions occurred. First electrospun precursor nanofibers were synthesized with the HAc and DMF evaporating during electrospinning. The TiBO was then converted to a Ti O Ti network gel through a sol gel process. The FA was converted into poly furfuryl alcohol through condensation and or dehydration. After pyrolysis in argon at 325 C. the intermediate nanofibers were formed and they consisted of partially decomposed PVP partially pyrolyzed Ti O Ti gel and partially carbonized poly furfuryl alcohol . The subsequent carbothermal reduction in argon at 1400 C. completely removed the PVP and the Ti O Ti gel was turned to TiO. Moreover the freshly generated carbon and TiOreacted almost instantly and formed TiC. The initially formed TiC possibly was in an amorphous form such that when homogeneous nucleation did occur it led to the formation of the TiC crystallites.

In optional aspects of the present invention the total amounts of Ti and C atoms can be precisely controlled and the optimal heat treatment applied thereby resulting in completely polycrystalline nanofibers and or nano ribbons. However the TiC nanofibers and or ribbons having TiC crystallites embedded in the amorphous carbon matrix would also be desirable because the amorphous matrix would facilitate the high temperature Cltreatment to selectively remove titanium.

After the chlorination treatment of the electrospun precursor with 70 wt of TiC and 30 wt of carbon at 600 C. the TiC CDC nanofibers showed an average pore size of 1 nm and a high specific surface area of 1390 m g. It is to be understood that the average pore size and specific surface area can be tailored through adjusting the weight fractions of TiC and C in the electrospun precursor and through adjusting the processing parameters of chlorination treatment.

The electrospun TiC nano fibrous felts and the derived TiC CDC nano felts have applications including catalyst support gas storage and super capacitors.

The present invention provides a mechanically resilient mat i.e. a felt made out of the continuous nanofibers or nano ribbons overlayed on top of one another. The individual fibers ribbons making up this nano felt consisted of TiC nanocrystallites embedded in a continuous matrix of disordered carbon. Based on theremgravity and image analysis performed on one sample the disordered carbon was about 25 30 wt . In addition the nanocrystallites were surrounded by a few layers shells of graphitic carbon.

The resulting nano felt could be bent without breaking within the linear elastic range and a maximum bending angle of 30 was observed corresponding to a strain of 0.01 for a 200 m thin felt . and illustrate exemplary TEM images of a TiC CDC nano felt after chlorination at 400 C. and 600 C. respectively. Based on gravimetry an effective density of 0.14 g cmwas measured corresponding to a porosity of 94 vol comprising the micro and meso porosities and inner fabric space . With the selected chlorination conditions no residual carbide was found in the resulting TiCCDC nano felts. See showing XRD and showing Raman spectra of the nano felts and their precursor electrospun TiC nano fibrous felt . Only the D and G modes of graphitic and disordered i.e. amorphous carbon were visible in the precursor s spectrum . The nano felt made from chlorination at the lower 400 C. temperature had a larger amount of disordered carbon and a higher amount of graphitic carbon than the nano felt made at the higher 600 C. temperature. Table 1 shows the corresponding band position Full Width at Half Maximum FWHM and I Ifor these TiC CDC nano felts and their electrospun precursor. As can be seen the TiCCDC nano felt made at 400 C. had a larger amount of disordered carbon because it had a higher I Iratio . When the chlorination temperature was increased to 600 C. the amount of graphitic carbon increased and the I Iratio decreased.

Table 2 shows the corresponding values of SSA PSD and pore volume acquired from Nand COgas sorption isotherms for the TiC CDC nano felts and their electrospun precursor. As can be seen increasing the chlorination temperature increased the SSA and the total pore volume. and correspond to Table 2 with showing nitrogen sorption isotherms showing SSA values and showing pore volumes of the nanofelts and their electro spun precursor prepared at 400 C. and 600 C.

As can be appreciated the present invention s combination of nano scale pores partially graphitic carbon which is electrically conductive and continuous fibers may be particularly useful in super capacitor electrode applications. In addition these present fibrous felts have a large inter fiber porosity that can allow the easy access of electrolytes and improve power handling capacity.

Electrochemical measurements were taken of another sample of the TiC CDC nano felt. These measurements showed a high gravimetric capacitance of 110 F g in an aqueous electrolyte 1 M HSO and 65 F g in an organic electrolyte 1.5 M TEA BF4 in acetonitrile . Because of the unique structure of the felt a fade of the capacitance of only 50 at a high scan rate of 5 V s was observed. A fade of just 15 was observed when tested in 1 M HSOat 1 V s resulting in a high gravimetric capacitance of 94 F g. This is excellent since such a high performance was previously only achieved with technologies like graphene or carbon based supercapacitors which require binders for their formation .

Comparison tests were also done on conventional TiC CDC powders carbon onions and nano diamonds. What was found was that the TiC CDC nano felts and carbon onions showed pronounced capacitive behavior at high scan rates whereas the conventional TiC CDC powder had a resistive behavior. Specifically illustrates cyclic voltammograms of the TiC CDC nano felt compared to conventional micron sized TiC CDC powder tested in MCE at 1 V s in 1 M HSO and to carbon onions . As can be seen the present TiC CDC nano felt displayed a higher capacitance across a range of frequencies as compared to TiC CDC powder . A similar high frequency behavior was also seen in the carbon onions . is a comparison plot of the scan rate vs. normalized capacitance for these three samples. As can be seen the total capacitance of the present nano felt was lower. This is due to its smaller specific surface area.

Further electrical performance measurements were taken as follows. and illustrate cyclic voltammograms for the TiC CDC nano felt and its electrospun precursor produced according to the present invention. shows the gravimetric capacitance and galvanic charge discharge measurements for the nano felt and its precursor in organic and aqueous electrolytes in comparison for different current densities. shows a comparison between the fade and in normalized capacitance and in the MCE. As can be seen powder based super capacitors have inferior power handling capacity. In contrast with the present TiC CDC nano felts conductivity is not lost as the conductive fibers remain intact. Thus with a comparable capacitance in aqueous electrolytes the TiC CDC nano felts showed a power handling comparable to graphene based super capacitors. shows the frequency dispersion of the phase angle. As can be seen the phase angle is very close to 90 for frequencies up to 1 Hz which indicates a function being very close to an ideal capacitor. Lastly shows the cycling stability at 100 mA galvanostatic charge discharge being much higher than for conventional TiC CDC films . As can be seen the high capacitance of TiC CDC nano felts synthesized at 600 C. did not fade over thousands of cycles.

The above results of the electrochemical testing showed that the nano felts retained 50 and 30 of their capacitance at the enormous scan rates of 5 V s and 100 V s respectively. This is a much lower decrease in capacitance as compared to activated carbon or conventional TiC CDC powder.

With the combination of superior electrochemical properties and mechanical flexibility stability the present TiC CDC nano felts may be important in applications for the development of high performance super capacitors and or flexible electrodes. This is due in part to the fact that the TiC CDC nano felts retained the morphological properties of the precursor yet had substantially higher values of SSA and pore volume.

Testing was also done on the present TiC CDC nano felts when synthesized at 1000 C. At this high synthesis temperature 1000 C. the fibers in the nano felt consist of a pore network in which the pores are separated by one or two carbon layers only. This testing showed gravimetric capacitances of up to 135 F g in aqueous and 120 F g in organic electrolytes. In addition approximately 50 of the low rate capacitance was maintained at a very high scan rate of 5 V s.

It was determined that raising the chlorination temperature increases the SSA and the pore volume of the TiC CDC nano felts and their electrospun precursor. In addition it was shown that low synthesis temperature 

The present TiC CDC was shown to have a high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance. After chlorination the present porous nano felts maintain their size shape and flexibility. While small pores account for large surface area and therefore high capacitance larger pores facilitate ion mobility through the TiC CDC felts.

Experimentation was then performed to determine the relationship between chlorination temperature and the resulting TiC CDC structure in terms of carbon ordering pore size pore size distribution and surface area and the properties of conductivity series resistance capacitance and rate handling ability.

As seen in the XRD pattern of trace amounts of unreacted nano TiC were only found in the nano felt chlorinated at 200 C. The two broad peaks centered at 24 and 44 show a diffuse scattering that corresponds to disordered carbon. shows a Raman scattering with a peak at the D mode being characteristic for disordered carbon with crystallites . It was also determined that the capacitance also increases with the chlorination temperature. FWHW measurements are shown in . Pore width measurements are shown in and SSA measurements are shown in . Nitrogen sorption was used to characterize the PSD SSA and pore volume of TiC CDC. Table 3 shows that raising the chlorination temperature increases the SSA and the pore volume.

As can be seen the electrospun TiC precursor nanofibers nano felts is composed of nano scaled TiC crystallites embedded in a carbon matrix. Upon chlorination at 200 C. the nano felt is predominantly amorphous carbon with residual graphite layers around the former TiC nanocrystals that have been completely transformed into CDC. Higher chlorination temperatures result in higher order of carbon structure.
