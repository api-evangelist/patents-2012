title: Systems for induction of gene expression and protein depletion in yeast
abstract: A system allows for rapid and specific induction of individual genes in eukaryotic cells using a chimeric transcriptional activator that is responsive to hormone inducer. Upon addition of the hormone, cytoplasmic transcriptional activator localizes to the nucleus and subsequently binds to promoters containing sequences that bind to its DNA-binding domain. Genetic modifications allow for rapid and specific degradation of a targeted protein upon addition of hormone by means of a regulated degron method that utilizes a protease variant. This system is useful for discovering new compounds by high throughput screening when introducing compound libraries to these protein-depleted cells.

The invention relates to the control of protein abundance in eukaryotes. More specifically the invention relates to induction of targeted protein and to proteasomal degradation of specific protein.

Previous studies of the dynamics and functional relationships of genes and the networks they comprise followed gene expression after a well defined perturbation to a culture growing in steady state. Traditionally such perturbations involved a pulse of preferential carbon source heat or nutrients Rand B2006 . However when one wants to perturb only a single element of the system such as a transcription factor use of the traditional perturbation methods result in side effects on physiology and gene expression that can be deleterious to the experiment. What is needed to resolve this problem is finding specific ways of turning on or off only a single transcription factor.

Significant effort in the prior art had been placed on achieving tightly controlled gene expression systems across a spectrum of organisms guided by the transformative discoveries of gratuitous inducers of expression of the lactose operon genes in . The significant desirable features of a useful induction system include 1 a complete lack of target gene activation in the absence of inducer 2 rapid induction of a target gene in the presence of inducer and 3 the availability of a truly gratuitous inducer. A gratuitous inducer should interact with no other regulatory system and should be essentially inert with respect to physiology.

A common approach in mammalian cells is a direct adaptation of bacterial systems tetracycline inducible tetR based systems Let al. 1990 . By fusing activating domains e.g. VP16 to tetR and expressing this chimeric transcription factor transcription of a target gene downstream of a minimally active promoter with the appropriate operator sites can be maintained at high levels in the absence of inducer. TetR VP16 also called tTA tetracycline transactivator unbinds DNA in the presence of tetracycline thereby repressing transcription. This configuration is referred to as tet off. Tet off has been used for studying the effects of depletion of a target gene but the kinetics of transcriptional shut off do not result in rapid elimination of the protein products of the regulated genes as many proteins have long half lives. Therefore a better method for rapid depletion of a target gene is needed.

The most widely used overexpression system in has utilized GAL4 mediated induction of targets which are placed downstream of promoters containing 17 mer UASgal sites such as P P P CGG N CCG SEQ ID NO 1 Get al. 1985 . The UASgal motif is recognized by dimerized GAL4 proteins Het al. 2008 Met al. 1992 . Deletion of GAL1 has made galactose overexpression of GAL driven targets nearly gratuitous Het al. 1989 . Since GAL genes are catabolite repressed activation required that cells be grown in relatively poor non glucose carbon sources prior to the galactose pulse.

A more convenient system was developed that avoids the necessity of switching the carbon source. A chimeric transcriptional activator called GEV Let al. 1993 contains the DNA binding domain of Gal4p the hormone binding domain HBD of the human estrogen receptor hER and the highly electronegative portion of herpes simplex virus protein VP16 which confers strong transcriptional activity Set al. 1988 . Though GEV binds DNA via a GAL4 DNA binding domain it is not subject to inhibition or repression by glucose making it feasible to conduct induction and overexpression experiments in standard glucose containing media simply by the addition of the inducer estradiol. The presence of the HBD provides a simple on off switch for GEV activity steroid receptor binding of ligand results in a conformational change of the receptor and its subsequent disassociation from the Hsp90 chaperone complex Pand T1997 .

Previously improvements over the original GEV system were made by placing GEV expression under the control of low strength constitutive promoters to reduce errant expression of target genes in the absence of estradiol Gand P2000 Vet al. 2009 . Another GEV based induction system implemented an autocatalytic approach to rapidly increase GEV production in the presence of estradiol. In this case GEV was placed under the control of the GAL1 promoter which contains 4 UASgal sites Qet al. 2007 . However the prior art only envisioned GEV for induction of gene expression.

Genetically modified yeast cells were created by a novel method involving transformation with a DNA construct to modify any target gene so that when expressed a degradation signal a dormant N degron is placed at the amino terminus of the protein. Following transformation the selectable drug marker used for the transformation was eliminated. The recipient cells were also modified to contain a hormone responsive transcription factor and a protease encoding gene induced by this transcription factor. Introduction of hormone into the cell medium results in activation of the transcription factor with minimal effects on the physiology and transcriptome of the cells except for target specific degradation and downstream effects. The protease cleaves the dormant N degron to initiate N end rule degradation of the target protein.

The novel cell system allows rapid specific target protein degradation in glucose grown cells of yeast such as . Additionally the transcription factor GEV also rapidly induces single genes in a hybrid diploid yeast e.g. . The N degron GEV method extends to yeast generally and more generally extends to eukaryotes.

The method comprises exposing the eukaryotic cell to a hormone by contacting the cell with an effective amount of a hormone that binds to the hormone binding domain of the transcriptional activator inducing expression of the protease by the protease encoding gene.

The terms peptide polypeptide and protein are used interchangeably herein and refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length.

By construct is meant a recombinant nucleic acid generally recombinant DNA which has been generated for the purpose of the expression of a specific nucleotide sequence s or is to be used in the construction of other recombinant nucleotide sequences.

 Operably linked refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. For instance a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects its transcription or expression.

The term transformation refers to a permanent or transient genetic change induced in a cell following introduction of new nucleic acid i.e. DNA exogenous to the cell . In a eukaryotic cell a permanent genetic change is generally achieved by introduction of the DNA into the genome of the cell.

The N degron is an intracellular degradation signal whose essential determinant is a specific destabilizing N terminal amino acid residue of a substrate protein. A set of N degrons containing different destabilizing residues is manifested as the N end rule which relates the in vivo half life of a protein to the identity of its N terminal residue. The fundamental principles of the N end rule and the proteolytic pathway that implements it are well established in the literature see e.g. Bachmair et al. Science 234 179 1986 Varshaysky. Cell 69 725 1992 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 122 463 5 132 213 5 093 242 and 5 196 321 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. A dormant N degron is one that must be cleaved or degraded in order that the destabilizing residue becomes the N terminal amino acid residue.

An estradiol responsive transcription factor is one that has a hormone binding domain that binds to estradiol to activate the transcription factor.

The term degrade and degradation as used herein refer to proteolytic degradation as may be facilitated by a component of the N end rule proteolytic pathway. Such a degradation is meant to describe the targeted degradation of a specific target gene polypeptide. 

The description of induction and degradation systems herein make reference to a modified target gene driven by its native promoter. Genes included in expression vectors must be driven by a nucleotide sequence comprising a regulatory element for example a promoter. Several types of promoters are well known in the transformation arts as are other regulatory elements that can be used alone or in combination with promoters. As used herein promoter includes reference to a region of DNA upstream from the start of transcription and involved in recognition and binding of RNA polymerase and other proteins to initiate transcription.

A nucleic acid is hybridizable to another nucleic acid such as a cDNA genomic DNA or RNA when a single stranded form of the nucleic acid can anneal to the other nucleic acid under the appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength. Hybridization and washing conditions are well known and exemplified in Sambrook J. Fritsch E. F. and Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor 1989 and Sambrook J. and Russell W. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Third Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor 2001 .

The chimeric transcription factor used to induce gene expression has a hormone binding domain from a steroid receptor. When the hormone binding domain is bound by hormone the transcription factor localizes to the cell nucleus. Thus the method includes a step of exposing the cell to an effective amount of a hormone that binds to the hormone binding domain of the transcription factor. The effective amount of hormone refers to an amount that results in observable transcription of the target genes above background levels.

The invention relates to the regulation of protein abundance in eukaryotic cells. It is exemplified herein with novel yeast cells having a GEV system developed using a protrophic HAP1 S288c strain of yeast. All strains described herein are shown in Table 1 below .

One aspect of the invention relates to targeted protein depletion in yeast. The proteins of interest have a modified degron sequence attached thereto. Generally the modified degron sequence is at the initiator codon of the open reading frame e.g. methionine in yeast . In an alternative embodiment the modified degron sequence is at a site internal to and in frame with the open reading frame such that the target protein retains native or near native activity. Upon adding hormone inducer to the medium a protease is induced which cleaves the N degron leaving an N end rule destabilizing amino acid exposed at the N terminus so that the proteins are rapidly degraded by the process known as N end rule degradation. In this aspect of the invention a protease e.g. TEV is induced by a transcription factor e.g. GEV and the protease targets the proteins of interest so that the proteins are rapidly degraded by N end rule degradation.

The inducible protein depletion method allows rapid specific target protein degradation simply by making the system hormone inducible using a modular transcriptional activator that has a hormone binding domain as well as the DNA binding domain and activator domain. As exemplified in the examples herein the hormone was estradiol and the transcriptional activator was GEV. As exemplified herein GEV induced the tobacco etch virus TEV protease which unmasks an N degron to enable N end rule degradation of a target gene driven by its native promoter and modified to contain a dormant N degron. Thus the inducible protein depletion method has an advantage over the tet off system of resulting in a rapid elimination of the protein products of the regulated genes.

Another aspect of the invention relates to a chimeric transcription factor. One chimeric transcription factor for use in the method of the invention is the transcriptional activator GEV which has three modular domains from different sources that function in hormone binding DNA binding and activation. Transcriptional activators with alternative modular domains are also contemplated.

The contemplated transcriptional activators are useful to get effective target specificity. By replacing GEV s GAL4 DNA binding domain with a DNA binding domain from a non yeast transcription factor such as LexA or from custom designed zinc fingers that recognize DNA sequences not found in the number of non target genes induced or repressed will be lower than with GEV.

When constructing similar transcriptional activators with alternative components the most specific activator will have a DNA binding domain that has high target DNA specificity and low enough affinity for binding DNA that the chimeric protein only binds to a single sequence of interest. For example the DNA binding domain can be any other endogenous rationally designed or engineered zinc finger domain e.g. zinc fingers from endogenous mouse transcription factor zif268 4 fingered rationally designed zinc finger 4Z or any other engineered Cys2His2 zinc finger domain . Two embodiments of the engineered zinc finger domain are the ZEV and the 4ZEV transcription factors. In these embodiments the DNA binding domain of GEV is replaced with an alternative DNA binding domain that recognizes a sequence that is either absent from or rare within the yeast genome. Zif268 the DNA binding domain of ZEV recognizes the sequence GCGTGGGCG SEQ ID NO 2 as well as many previously described similar sequences. 4ZEV was designed to recognize the 12 basepair sequence GCGGCGGAGGAG SEQ ID NO 3 which is not found in the yeast genome. Specificity determination predicts this zinc finger would function with all binding sites included in GCG G C C G G T G A C G G A C A C G T SEQ ID NO 4 . In practice the target sites for ZEV or 4ZEV are arranged as 3 dimer site targets 6 monomeric targets with one or two bases between each monomeric target to allow for efficient assembly around the DNA double helix.

Since the transcription factors have a modular DNA binding domain derived from other organisms or have a completely synthetic DNA binding domain the transcription factor and the inventive method are useful with respect to any eukaryotic cell.

With respect to other alternative modular domains of the transcription factor the invention contemplates replacing the hormone binding domain so that a variety of hormones will work with the inventive system. In this case the hormone binding domain is replaced by the binding domain of any hormone receptor such that hormone binding results in nuclear localization of the transcription factor. For example the binding domains of the glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors may be used.

Replacement of the VP16 activating domain with other activating domains such as a protein sequence that provides an acidic region is also contemplated e.g. the acidic regions of GAL4 or GCN4 .

The ACT1 promoter used for driving GEV expression in the examples is a relatively strong promoter. While this is an advantage for some uses a diversity of promoter strengths should be considered when constructing a system similar to what has been herein described but with alternative components. The diversity of promoter strengths is an important consideration since very strong induction appears from the data shown to be at least partly responsible for the modest impairment of growth seen under full induction. This diversity of promoter strengths can be generated by isolating mutant promoters or by using weaker natural promoters.

The contemplated invention includes a variety of promoters to express the GEV ZEV or other hormone activated transcriptional activator. Any promoter native to the organism in which the inventive system is placed or that works by virtue of similarity in the original organism is appropriate. The promoter should be constitutive expressing the activator at an appropriate level such that upon hormone treatment the desired graded response of activation is achieved. In addition to ACT1 in yeast other examples that exemplify this concept include the TDH3 ADH1 or TEF promoter or in mammalian cells the cytomegalovirus promoter CMV .

The inventive protein depletion system contemplates use of an alternative protease. In this respect what is contemplated is use of any protease with a specific recognition sequence that is not present in any of the native proteins in the organism used in the depletion system. For example the inventive protein depletion system is also contemplated with use of proteases 2A or 3C encoded by the genome of human rhinovirus HRV 2A HRV 3C .

Another manner of constructing the system of the invention is by adapting other nuclear receptors that work by the same mechanism as the one in our GEV system so that independent induction of two target genes can be accomplished. This will be particularly useful if one wants to use the system to provide pulses of protein. With two independent inducing systems one can induce synthesis of a target protein by adding one inducer and then destroy at will the protein by inducing TEV with the other inducer.

The transformed cells can provide rapid depletion of single or multiple cellular proteins. This system is readily adaptable to the study of essential genes genes that are lethal if deleted . Through rapid depletion the cell s transcriptional response to the loss of these genes can be assayed over a time course using gene expression microarrays. Depletion via the degron method mimics the effect of application of potential inhibitors of a target polypeptide. Studies are conducted in relevant physiological conditions in the presence of normal or near normal expression of the target before application of inhibitors . This enables determination of the immediate and or long term effects of inhibition depletion to assess target and off target physiological effects. This is especially useful if genetic deletion of the target leads to inviability. Likewise transient induction can be assessed starting from no expression or normal expression e.g. diploid cells with one normal and one hybrid transcription factor inducible promoter modified target present .

Both induction and degradation are tunable facilitating comparative two strain screens. Induction level adjustment is convenient for rescue screens where overexpression would be deleterious to growth or would affect another assay marker and compounds that inhibit the target return the cells to a normal state i.e. growth or normal marker expression . When induction is undesirable but a two strain comparative screen is indicated partial depletion can be accomplished to enable comparison to cells with normal expression of the target.

The rescue screen is useful when the target protein is an enzyme or structural protein that when overexpressed is harmful to the cell e.g. tubulin . The target of this screen is not necessarily native to the screening organism. For example a mammalian target could be screened in yeast as long as the harm toxicity of the screening cells is related to the manner the target functions in its natural host. In such a case a target gene construct is prepared having a promoter responsive to the hormone inducible activator and this is introduced into a chromosome of the cells of the screening organism. Growth studies are conducted to determine the level of hormone necessary to achieve a constant level of target protein that leads to a growth deficiency of the host organism. These host cells displaying the growth deficiency are then exposed to a compound library and a determination is made of which compound s afford a growth advantage to these host cells. The compounds that afford a growth advantage are candidates for enzymatic inhibitors or structural disruptors of the target protein.

Depletion of a protein involved in the production processing or consumption of a valuable metabolite or protein can be accomplished in a near gratuitous fashion. Application of the depletion inducer at a strategic phase of batch fermentation can lead to increased yield of the desired metabolite or protein.

Thus this system has applications in synthetic biology pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and in basic biomedical research. One application is in bioengineering for biologic or compound synthesis. This system can be integrated as a module into engineered circuits. As used herein a circuit is a programmed set of genes being expressed or proteins that are degraded. Rapid gratuitous degradation of a single protein is used in the construction of more complex synthetic circuits that are orthogonal to the cell s wild type machinery. For example the modified yeast cells are used as a vehicle for producing large amounts of a particular chemical since achieving specific levels of particular proteins is essential for achieving maximal efficiency. The GEV TEV system allows a particular target protein to be tuned down without affecting the other cellular machinery.

The cells of the invention are also useful for high throughput screening HTS of compound libraries by exposing these compound libraries to the protein depleted cells by methods well known to those skilled in the art. HTS can for example be used for discovery of new pharmaceutical or agricultural compounds. The cells used in this manner behave essentially as wild type capable of growing in normal non physiologically changing medium. They allow for target identification.

For some drug targets constitutive overexpression or elimination of a target protein is not possible because this would produce deleterious consequences for the cell. Thus a screen of the type that uses a control strain and a modified strain or cell line for testing compounds would not be possible. The protein induction depletion system of this invention overcomes that problem. With this system it is possible to transiently overexpress or deplete a target. In doing so one skilled in the art can 1 determine the appropriate duration and concentration of exposure to the hormone used for induction or depletion so that the target protein concentration is sufficiently changed for the purpose of the assay 2 expose cells to the library of compounds 3 determine the appropriate time for cells to recover from the perturbation e.g. after dilution with non hormone containing medium and 4 determine the growth difference or other assay specific change conferred by a compound that distinguishes the treated control cells from the hormone responsive cells.

The following examples set forth the general procedures involved in practicing the present invention. To the extent that specific materials are mentioned it is merely for purposes of illustration and is not intended to limit the invention.

Prototrophic HAP1 yeast strains were constructed that can be readily modified to either 1 induce expression of a single gene or 2 rapidly degrade a single target protein Table 1 below . These strains contain an integrated copy of GEV driven by an ACT1 promoter and are gal4 gal1 .

For induction overexpression studies GEV containing strains of either mating type DBY12020 MATa and DBY12021 MAT were constructed. These strains can be transformed with a KanMX Plinear fragment Liko et al. 2006 in front of any non essential gene to make that gene inducible by estradiol.

For protein degradation studies DBY12132 and DBY12200 were constructed which contain both GEV and the TEV protease. In DBY12132 and DBY12200 P GEV is at the LEU2 and CAN1 locus respectively. By modifying a target gene in these strains to contain a degron sequence recognized by TEV at its amino terminus a gene can be expressed under its native promoter and degraded in the presence of estradiol.

For microscopy and flow cytometry experiments cells were grown in low fluorescence media LFM . LFM is chemostat minimal medium Bet al. 2008 lacking riboflavin and folic acid and contains in addition to glucose 20 g L 5 g L NH SO 1 g L KHPO 0.5 g L MgSO 0.1 g L NaCl 0.1 g L CaCl 0.5 mg L HBO 0.04 mg l CuSO 0.1 mg l KI 0.2 mg l FeCl 0.4 mg l MnSO 0.4 mg l MnSO 0.2 mg l NaMoO 0.4 mg l ZnSO 2 ng 1 biotin 0.4 mg l calcium pantothenate 2 mg l inositol 0.4 mg l niacin 0.2 mg l para aminobenzoic acid 0.4 mg l pyridoxine HCl 0.4 mg l thiamine.

For induction experiments yeast were cultured in 500 mL chemostats Sixfors Bottmingen Switzerland under phosphate limitation 20 mg L potassium phosphate and pulsed with 1 M estradiol Tocris Biosciences Missouri . For the MET4 induction experiment phosphate limited media was supplemented with 200 mg L methionine. Culture volume was maintained at 300 mL. 12 18 hours of batch phase growth prior to pump turn on was initiated from a 1 60 dilution of cells grown overnight in the same medium. Cultures were grown at 30 C. stirred at 400 RPM and aerated at 5 L min with filtered humidified air.

Fluorescence was measured with an epifluorescence Nikon Eclipse TI inverted microscope using a Nikon 40 0.95NA DIC Plan Apo objective. The microscope is equipped with a PerfectFocus system Nikon for maintaining the correct focal plane a Clara CCD Camera Andor DR328G for recording fluorescence emission and a TI S ER motorized stage with encoders to ensure near perfect return to marked stage positions Nikon MEC56100 . GEV GFP emission was visualized at 525 nm 50 nm bandwidth upon excitation at 470 nm 40 nm bandwidth Chroma 49002 Nikon ETGFP filter cube . HTB2 mCherry emission was visualized at 620 nm 60 nm bandwidth upon excitation at 545 nm 30 nm bandwidth Chroma 96364 Nikon ET DSRed filter cube . Image acquisition was automatically controlled using NIS Elements software.

For Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH images were acquired with an Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence microscope as described in Silverman et al. 2010 .

Overnight cultures of DBY11415 MATa MAT HTB2 mCherry caURA3 HTB2 his3 HIS3 gal1 P loxP GAL1 gal4 LEU2 GAL4 HAP1 hap1 leu2 0 P GEV GFP KanMX LEU2 were grown in LFM overnight to saturation. Overnight cultures were diluted 1 50 in fresh LFM media to a Klett of 10. The Klett was monitored and at Klett 40 cells were loaded into 96 well glass bottomed optical plates for microscopy Nunc 265300 . Each well in the 96 well plate was incubated with 30 ul of concanavalin A solution 2 mg ml concanavalin A MP Biomedicals 150710 dissolved in 5 mM MnCl5 mM CaClpH 6.5 to fix cells to the bottom of the plate. After a 5 minute incubation excess concanavalin A was aspirated off and 4 L of cell culture 91 L of fresh LFM media 1 L of 100 ethanol were added to each well. Cells were allowed to settle to the bottom of each well while stage positions were marked on the microscope using ambient room light.

Cells were imaged immediately prior to and immediately after addition of 4 L estradiol to each well. Each experiment was done in triplicate and two images were taken per each well of the 96 well plate resulting in 6 image frames per concentration of estradiol. Images were acquired every 170 seconds during induction of GEV GFP localization.

Growth of strain DBY11415 was performed as described above for the GEV induction experiments. Cells were maintained in a flow cell Bioptechs FCS2 during microscopy. Cells were adhered to the bottom of a 40 mm round coverslip by first incubating the coverslip with concanavalin A as above and then the coverslip was assembled into the FCS2 chamber. Cells were maintained at room temperature during the course of the experiment 25 C. . The Klett of the culture was 110 when cells were loaded into the flow cell. Two peristaltic pumps INSTECH P720 were used to perfuse media to cells during microscopy. One pump perfused LFM medium and the other perfused LFM media with 1 M estradiol. The pump flow rates were automatically controlled by computer Bioptechs Perfusion Controller and by switching between pumps media was exchanged within the cell chamber in 2 minutes. GEV nuclear localization was first induced with LFM 1 uM estradiol for 50 minutes. The pump flow rates were then switched and images were acquired every 300 s to monitor delocalization of GEV GFP. Conditions for imaging GFP and mCherry were identical to the induction experiment except that a 1.5 optovar was inserted into the optical path to magnify images from 40 to 60 .

Image processing was performed by preprocessing the images in ImageJ and then using a custom written Matlab script to extract the intensities in the nuclei relative to the cytoplasm. Briefly the image processing was done as follows Fluorescence images were background subtracted using the rolling ball background subtraction command in ImageJ using a ball radius of 50 pixels. The method has been previously described S1983 . Images were examined by eye in ImageJ and out of focus images were removed before further analysis.

These preprocessed images were then analyzed using a custom written Matlab script. In brief the code first identifies cells using various thresholding commands on the GFP images to create a mask of the image an image where pixels inside of cells are identified as 1 and pixels outside of cells are identified as 0 . The user is then given an opportunity to correct any errors in this mask by hand. The code then uses similar thresholding commands on the mCherry image to identify cell nuclei and create a mask for the nuclei. Using these two masks the script then extracts intensity information from the GFP image for each cell identified in the cell mask using the nucleus mask to differentiate between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. A particle tracking routine track.m is then used to align values for cells and nuclei between images taken at different time points. Finally the various parameters are exported as cell by time matrices where each row represents a single cell identified throughout the time course. The localization score in all figures is determined for each cell by first averaging the top 5 of pixel intensities and then dividing this number by the average pixel intensity over the entire cell Cet al. 2008 .

Cell fluorescence was measured with a BD LSRII Multi Laser Analyzer with HTS. High fluorescence in single cells was determined from the distribution of fluorescent intensities in cells lacking GFP the distribution is determined from the fluorescent values of 100 000 cells . The cutoff for high fluorescence was set at the top 0.2 of the distribution GFP signal 190 au .

FISH probe design and experiments were performed as described by Silverman et al. 2010 . DBY12040 was grown to early log phase and pulsed with 1 M estradiol. Cells were fixed prior to estradiol addition to the culture and at 2 and 8 minutes following estradiol addition. The Cy3 labeled DNA probes used for FISH are listed in Table 2 below.

100 L of cells media were grown on flat bottom 96 well plates Costar 3631 . Awas measured every 15 minutes in a Synergy HT Biotek Vermont microplate reader. Cells were grown at 30 C. with medium shaking. Growth rates were computed with spline fits using the grofit R package Ket al. 2010 .

RNA from cells was extracted labeled and hybridized to Agilent expression microarrays as described by Brauer et al. 2008 with slight modifications. Briefly RNA was extracted from frozen cells with a standard acid phenol method and then cleaned with RNeasy Qiagen . Cleaned mRNA was then converted to cDNA and subsequently converted to labeled cRNA with the Agilent Quick Amp Labeling Kit Part No. 5190 0424 . Microarray hybridizations were performed for 17 hours at 65 C. and rotated on a rotisserie at 20 RPM. Microarrays were washed and then scanned with Agilent Feature Extractor Software version 9.5. Flagged features marked as unreliable were marked N A. Raw green and red channel intensities were floored to a value of 350 i.e. intensities below 350 were set equal to 350 . If the numerator red channel sample RNA for a given measurement was floored the denominator green channel reference RNA for that measurement was set to the average green channel intensity for that gene. The purpose of this smoothing process is to make genes with negligible red channel signal intensity less sensitive to small fluctuations in the reference intensity. After flooring of the data the log 2 ratios were computed.

For time series experiments 5 mL of cells were taken per culture per time point. Reference RNA was taken from DBY12001 grown in a phosphate limited chemostat at a dilution rate of 0.18 h. Enrichment for gene ontology GO terms was determined using GO term finder Boyle et al. 2004 .

This consists of two parts each of which ends up inserted into the chromosome. One of these is the protease cassette which contains the GAL1 promoter a modified TEV protease coding region the spliceosome subunit p14 peptide a CYC1 terminator and a selectable hygromycin marker all integrated to replace the genomic GAL1 coding sequence. The details of this construction are described in detail below. The second part is a simple way to insert the degron marker cassette at any promoter of interest. To this end a generic template was constructed for PCR that enables the placement of the modified degron marker cassette at the initiator methionine codon of any open reading frame the details are also to be found below.

Since native proteins are not sensitive to the TEV protease a generic system was devised to make the required modifications of any gene routine. The overall idea is to generate a native promoter driven degron modified gene. A particular new feature of this method is the inclusion of a removable CRE LOX segment that results in loss of the selectable marker. The details of this construction and its application to the specific cases of MET4 and MET31 are given below.

The 2 240 bp P GEV construct was amplified from the pAGL plasmid Veatch et al. 2009 using oligonucleotides containing 56 59 bases of sequence identity to the flanking region of the CAN1 gene ACT1 GEV to CAN1 FOR and ACT1 GEV to CAN1 REV . This PCR product was then transformed into either MATa or MATa wild type prototrophic yeast cells using a standard protocol.

Total protein was extracted from 10 mL aliquots of cultures at 2 10cells mL using YPX extraction kit Protein Discovery Knoxville Tenn. with the addition of protease inhibitors Roche tablets cat 11836170001 . Proteins were separated using Invitrogen NuPage precast 10 Bis Tris gels and transferred to Invitrolon PVDF Invitrogen cat LC2005 according to the manufacturer s protocols. Primary antibody for the Myc epitope was mouse anti human c Myc from BD Pharmingen cat 51 1485GR . Secondary antibody was goat anti mouse HRP cat 115 035 003 from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Primary antibody dilution was typically 1 1000 and secondary antibodies were used at 1 10 000 dilution. Immunoreactive peptides were detected by incubation with ECL detection reagent Amersham GE RPN2132 and imaging on HyBlot CL autoradiography film Denville Scientific Metuchen N.J. . As a loading control blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti Actin antibody loading control cat ab8224 Abcam Cambridge Mass. 1 600 or 1 2000 . Secondary antibody was as above goat anti mouse HRP. Protein levels were quantified with the Gel Analysis feature in ImageJ and normalized to the t 0 levels in each time course.

Primers are listed in Table 3 below. DBY12021 was constructed through a series of crosses and sporulations. First UCC1909 was crossed with DBY12013 ura3 0 leu2 0 lys2 1280 HAP1 Mat and sporulated to generate DBY11191 ura3 0 leu2 0 P GEV NatMX met15 LYS2 lys2 hap1 Mata . RSMx2 10a was then crossed with DBY12017 Pgal10 gal1 loxP P CRE phleo HAP1 Mat and sporulated to generate DBY12018 P gal1 loxP leu2 0 P GEV NatMX HAP1 Mata and DBY12019 P gal1 loxP leu2 0 P GEV NatMX HAP1 Mat . A gal4 LEU2 linear DNA fragment was PCR amplified from UCC1864 and transformed into DBY12018 and DBY12019 to generate the protrophic strains DBY12020 P gal1 loxP leu2 0 P GEV NatMX gal4 LEU2 HAP1 Mata and DBY12021 P gal1 loxP leu2 0 P GEV NatMX gal4 LEU2 HAP1 Mat .

The C terminus tagged GEV GFP reporter was generated by homologous recombination of GFP KanMX from pFA6 GFP KanMX Sheff and Thorn 2004 into DBY12021. The primers used for making the amplified GFP KanMX are GEVGFP F and GEVGFP R.

The C terminus tagged HTB2 mCherry fusion was generated by homologous recombination. mCherry was first digested from pFA6a mCherry HIS3MX6 pKT355 with PacI and AscI. pKT175 was cut with PacI and AscI to remove YECitrine. The digested mCherry was ligated into the pKT175 backbone. The primers used for making the mCherry CaUra3 PCR fragment for transformation are HTB2 F and HTB2 R Table 3 below .

The strains DBY12027 DBY12040 and DBY12086 were made by homologous recombination of KanMX PDNA into DBY12021. KanMX PDNA was PCR amplified from DBY11408 and with extra homology to insert directly upstream of the target ORF.

We deleted the chromosomal GAL1 ORF replacing it with the TEV protease. To do this two overlapping PCR products were created. The first PCR product was generated using oligonucleotides homologous to 1 the GAL1 promoter and to 2 the CYC1 terminator using pCT271 which contains P TEV CYC1 Taxis et al. 2009 as a template. The second PCR product was generated using one oligonucleotide comprising 40 nt at the end of the CYC1 terminator sequence for overlap with the first PCR product followed by the TEF promoter sequence paired with a second oligonucleotide comprising 40 nt downstream of the GAL1 ORF followed by TEF terminator sequences using pAG32 as a template Goldstein and McCusker 1999 . The two PCR products were transformed into strain DBY11389 selecting for hygromycin B Calbiochem resistance to generate the gal1 TEV HphMX strain. For some experiments this TEV allele was modified to replace the HphMX cassette with the URA3 gene. To do this two oligonucleotides were used to PCR URA3 from the pAG26 template Goldstein and McCusker 1999 1 containing the CYC1 terminator sequence in the TEV construct and the URA3 promoter present in pAG26 and 2 containing the URA3 terminator and a sequence 3 of the gal1 TEV HphMX insertion. This PCR product was transformed into strain DBY12096 resulting in strain DBY12132. All oligonucleotides are listed in Table 3 below.

Plasmid pCT251 Taxis et al. 2009 was used as a template for PCR to generate a fragment with 40 bp of homology to a region preceding the EcoRI site of YCplac33 an ATG the coding sequence of the degron cassette starting with the first spacer sequence encoding SISTL . . . SEQ ID NO 5 and ending with the ATG at the terminus of the last spacer region . . . ENSSM SEQ ID NO 6 followed by 40 bp of homology to the YCplac33 sequence region following the EcoRI site overlap tipi to ycplac F overlap tipi to ycplac R . YCplac33 was cleaved with EcoRI and was used in conjunction with the PCR fragment above to transform a ura3 auxotroph of yeast DBY12015 to Ura prototrophy. The resulting plasmid pRB3324 was reconstructed by homologous recombination in yeast and recovered into by standard methods Ma et al. 1987 .

The spacer region after the SF3b coding sequence of the degron cassette derived from pCT251 contains two EcoRI sites. To replace this sequence with the loxP flanked KanMX marker we used plasmid pUG6 Guldener et al. 1996 as a template to generate two PCR products necessary because of the identity of the loxP sites . The first product was generated by using an oligonucleotide N deg F lox F that contains 40 nt of homology preceding the first most amino terminal encoding EcoRI site of pRB3324 and 20 nt of homology to the 5 loxP site of pUG6 in conjunction with an oligonucleotide KanMX r1 homologous to a sequence of KanMX near the 3 end. The second product was generated using an oligonucleotide KanMX f1 homologous to a sequence near the 5 coding sequence of KanMX in conjunction with an oligonucleotide N deg R lox R containing 40 nt of homology to the second most carboxyl encoding EcoRI site of pRB3324 and 20 nt of homology to the 3 loxP site of pUG6. Plasmid pRB3324 was cut with EcoRI and used with the two oligonucleotides described above to transform yeast cells selecting for kanamycin G418 sulfate Cellgro resistance. The resulting plasmid pRB3326 recovered by transformation of the yeast DNA into is a generic template for generating PCR products for insertion at the initiator methionine of any yeast gene. shows the NDeg sequence that results from Cre mediated loxP recombination of such a construct at any gene.

To generate chromosomal NDeg MET4 the following oligonucleotides were used 1 an oligonucleotide MET4 Tipi F comprising 40 nucleotides of homology to the sequence upstream and including the ATG of MET4 and 20 nucleotides encoding the first spacer amino acids at the start of the degron construct of pRB3326 and 2 an oligonucleotide MET4 Tipi R comprising 40 nucleotides of homology to the sequence downstream of the ATG including an additional ATG and 20 nucleotides of the loxP modified spacer sequence at the end of the degron construct. This PCR product was used to transform a diploid DBY12021 DBY12032 to kanamycin resistance. After recovery and verification of the clone containing this construct we transformed the strain with pSH65 Gueldener et al. 2002 containing a GAL1 promoter driven Cre recombinase selecting for resistance to phleomycin Invivogen . The strain was grown overnight in galactose containing medium and plated for single colonies on YPD medium. The resulting colonies were screened for kanamycin resistance and the sensitive clones were PCR verified to have lost the loxP KanMX cassette. The strain was sporulated and haploids selected for epitope tagging.

Wild type and the corresponding NDeg MET4 strains were transformed with a PCR product to insert 13 Myc epitopes at the MET4 carboxyl terminus pFA6a 13Myc KanMX6 Longtine et al. 1998 was used as a template for oligonucleotides MET4 Myc F and MET4 Myc R containing sequences adjacent to the stop codon of MET4 and in frame 13Myc sequence 5 primer or TEF terminator sequences 3 primer . The resulting PCR fragment was transformed into cells selecting for kanamycin resistance. Standard genetic crosses were performed to generate DBY12055 and DBY11440.

MET31 was modified in a similar fashion to that of MET4. Oligonucleotides for MET3 specific NDeg amplification were Met31 TIPI F and Met31 TIPI R. The PCR product was used to transform a diploid to Kanamycin resistance. The KanMX sequence was eliminated as above. After sporulation both wild type MET31 and NDeg MET31 haploid strains were recovered. Carboxy terminal 13 Myc tags were appended to the sequence of each variant as above. Diploids were generated to contain GEV TEV and each of the MET31 variants DBY12234 NDeg MET31 13Myc DBY12235 MET31 13Myc for protein extraction.

Assays were performed essentially as described in Liu et al. 1999 with minor modifications. 5 mL of cells transformed with pCM64 GAL1 were grown to midlog phase in SC URA medium at 30 C. then incubated at indicated temperatures for the indicated times with or without a 5 L of ethanol vehicle control b 2 L of 2.5 mM estradiol Sigma dissolved in ethanol final concentration of 1 M c 5 L of 1 mM DOC deoxycorticosterone Sigma dissolved in ethanol final concentration of 1 M or d 5 L of 10 mM DOC dissolved in ethanol final concentration of 10 M . Cells 1 mL were harvested by centrifugation washed once with sterile HO and resuspended in 700 l of Z buffer 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 10 mM KCl 1 mM MgSO 50 mM mercaptoethanol . 50 l of chloroform and 50 l of 0.1 SDS were added and the cell suspension was vortex mixed at top speed for 30 seconds followed by addition of 200 l of 4 mg ml ONPG ortho nitrophenyl galactoside Sigma was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature until pale yellow color appeared. 350 l of 1 M NaCOwas added to stop the reactions. After clarification by centrifugation the supernatant was diluted and Awas measured within the linear response range. Specific galactosidase activity was calculated as follows A 1000 A volume of cells examined in ml time of incubation in minutes and reported in Miller units.

pCM64 GAL1 University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston K. Morano was constructed by inserting the promoter region of GAL1 in front of truncated lacZ into the plasmid pCM64 which was derived from pLG669Z Guarente and Ptashne 1981 .

The creation of the ZEV system was accomplished by replacing the gal4 DNA binding domain of the original GEV system with a set of Cys2His2 Zinc fingers. The ZEV system utilizes the zif268 zinc fingers. The 4ZEV system uses the four zinc finger protein rationally designed below.

To test the optimal zinc finger EV fusion and binding site complement three linkers between the zinc fingers and the estrogen receptor were tested 5 10 and 15 amino acids . These constructs were tested for their activity with a mCherry reporter when binding sites were positions spacing and orientations. Ultimately it was found that the 5 amino acid linker used in conjunction with three pairs of binding sites placed head to tail with a single base separating each site was the most active combination. All further binding sites and zinc finger constructs were built according to this template.

GFP reporter plasmids were constructed to test the ability of the new ZEV and 4ZEV transcription factors to activate a target gene in the presence of the hormone estradiol. Reporter plasmids were constructed using the CEN plasmid pRS416 Sikorski and Heiter 1989 which contains a URA3 selectable marker as a template. A DNA fragment containing a modified GAL1 promoter fused to GFP Gal1pr GFP was cloned into pRS416 between the NheI and AscI restriction sites. The GAL1 promoter was modified so that the 3 primary Gal4p and also GEV DNA binding sites were removed and replaced with DNA sequences containing 3 pairs of GEV ZEV or 4ZEV binding sites between the XbaI and NotI restriction sites .

Two isogenic strains of opposite mating type were constructed to use for studies of gene induction overexpression DBY12020 DBY12021 studies in see Materials and Methods . These strains contain an integrated copy of P GEV so that GEV is produced constitutively and at relatively high levels. A gene placed immediately downstream of a GAL regulated promoter will only be expressed after addition of estradiol to the growth medium .

Importantly though GEV binds DNA via a Gal4p DNA binding domain it is not subject to inhibition or repression by glucose making feasible induction and overexpression experiments in standard glucose containing media simply by the addition of the inducer estradiol.

A chromosomally integrated C terminus tagged GEV GFP reporter was constructed and its localization was measured following pulses of estradiol in single cells using a microfluidic device Hersen et al. 2008 McClean et al. 2011 . GEV localization level was proportional to the amount of added estradiol for a range of concentrations. At the higher doses 100 nM to 10 M nuclear localization signal is seen emerging from the background about 6 8 minutes following hormone addition. The initial rate of localization achieved its maximum at concentrations at or above 1 M estradiol.

To determine the residence time of activated GEV after removal of estradiol cells were grown in a flow chamber. For the first 50 minutes medium containing 1 M estradiol was flowed over the cells. Then the medium inflow was switched black line to a medium lacking estradiol resulting in an approximately exponential reduction in nuclear fluorescence with time. This demonstrated that nuclear half life of GEV is about 40 minutes C .

To investigate the kinetics of target gene induction by GEV the GAL1 promoter P was inserted in front of various reporter genes. First a strain was constructed where Pis driving transcription of the CBF1 gene at its native chromosomal locus. Upon GEV activation the level of CBF1 transcript reaches 70 of its maximal value by 5 minutes following addition of estradiol . Using Fluorescence in situ Hybridization FISH both the cytoplasmic transcripts and nuclear transcription sites of CBF1 were observable as shown in the image from which was taken 8 minutes following estradiol to the culture. A P GFP reporter was used to find the point at which GEV becomes saturated by inducer. The percentage of induced cells is determined see Materials and Methods over time and the results indicate that GEV is saturated between 100 nM and 1 M estradiol as the induction kinetics are very similar between these two concentrations .

The generally accepted model for the mechanism of nuclear receptors predicts that at sub saturating concentrations of inducer one should observe a steady state response that is graded as opposed to switch like Takahashi and Pryciak 2008 . Data from flow cytometry support this model for GEV induction of the galactose promoter driven GFP construct. At concentrations below 1 nM estradiol the average intensity is near the background after twelve hours of incubation . At 10 nM the average intensity is increased but well below what is achieved at higher inducer concentrations the significant point is that all the cells exposed to 10 nM estradiol exhibit significant fluorescence as shown by the shift of the entire distribution to the right . At 100 nM the average intensity induction is near maximum and the distribution of cells resembles closely that found for higher completely saturating concentrations of inducer.

The ACT1 promoter is known to be a relatively strong promoter thus full induction in the experimental system should result in overexpression of most GEV targets. Despite the deletion of the GAL1 locus the predicted strong GEV activation achieved at high concentrations of estradiol resulted in a slowing of growth . This is not due to estradiol toxicity because the slow growth does not occur in a strain lacking the GEV system. This could well be due to squelching GILL and PTASHNE 1988 whereby strong transcriptional activators repress off target genes through titration of the RNA polymerase machinery and thus reduce the cell s capacity for growth. At lower concentrations of estradiol 10 nM the GEV containing cells no longer show the growth defect but are able to induce the P GFP reporter essentially in all the cells nonetheless .

In order to determine whether physiologically significant expression is induced at intermediate 10 nM levels of induction where no growth consequence is observed an experiment was undertaken in which a lethal defect might be complemented in a GEV dependent manner. TPS2 encodes an enzyme that converts trehalose 6 phosphate to trehalose. Deletion of TPS2 causes a heat sensitive growth phenotype likely due to the build up of trehalose 6 phosphate Det al. 1993 . By placing TPS2 downstream of P cells become heat sensitive in the absence of estradiol . Growth is restored to wild type levels in the presence of 10 nM estradiol and the resulting growth is indistinguishable from wild type . This result suggests that maximal induction is not likely to be necessary in order to achieve physiological levels and therefore that intermediate levels of inducer suffice to avoid the growth inhibiting side effects.

Since yeast are extremely sensitive to slight changes in the extracellular environment the ideal growth setting for induction experiments is in the chemostat. Briefly a chemostat works by flowing fresh media into a growth vessel and culture medium is diluted from the vessel at a rate determined by the experimenter. This experimental setup allows for the growth of a culture of cells containing the GEV machinery and Pfused to any gene of interest to steady state. In the absence of estradiol the cells are effectively deletion mutants of the gene of interest. Adding estradiol to such cultures strongly induces the gene of interest so that the physiological consequences can be followed. For the particular case of genes encoding transcription factors the consequence to be followed is the genome wide transcriptional response of the cells. The goal is to infer the immediate targets of the factors and their relative strengths of response. For those that respond most quickly the further inference of causation is strengthened.

For this approach to be effective GEV needs to be nearly gratuitous meaning that it doesn t have a large effect on the transcriptional landscape of the cell. We can define a large effect as one that results in strong increases decreases in many genes such that it becomes difficult to separate out changes due to overexpressing the target gene and background. By growing a strain DBY12021 that contains GEV in a chemostat with the appropriate GAL machinery removed we find that GEV is nearly gratuitous . In DBY12021 the GAL1 gene is deleted as is the GAL10 promoter. Two hours following saturating 1 M estradiol addition 105 genes decrease 2 fold Table 3 below and 94 genes increase 2 fold Table 2 . This accounts for about 3 of all genes. Using GO term finder to find enriched processes within these groups repressed genes are most enriched for glucose catabolic processes corrected p value 8.49 10 and activated genes are most enriched for oxidation reduction processes corrected p value 1.73 10 .

GEV induction results in strong activation of GAL2 and GAL7 and moderate induction of GAL3 GAL5 and GAL80 . Surprisingly despite the removal of the GAL10 promoter by loxP in DBY12021 we observe slight induction of GAL10 over the course of the experiment.

We found two genes YPL067C and YPL066W that are divergently transcribed in response to GEV induction . These genes are reminiscent of GAL1 and GAL10 which are divergently transcribed in response to GAL4 activation. YPL066W and YPL067C are separated by a 385 nucleotide region. This region contains a single UASsequence. This sequence is conserved upstream of the YPL066W and YPL067C orthologs in and . Despite the conservation of the GAL4 binding site these genes have no known role in galactose metabolism and are of unknown function.

The ten genes mostly strongly repressed at 2 hours following GEV activation are shown in . We could not find any significant correlation with annotated functions these genes might hold in common.

Large scale ChIP chip studies have defined extensive transcription factor DNA binding maps yielding a highly informative though static view of genetic regulation. Using the GEV system to induce rapid and high level expression of a single transcription factor allows observation of the dynamics of activation or repression of each of its targets.

The MET4 gene encodes a well studied strong transcriptional activator of the sulfur metabolic genes in and served to exemplify that the inventive system serves as a powerful tool for observing genetic regulation. A strain containing P MET4 was grown to steady state in a phosphate limited chemostat containing high levels of extracellular methionine a condition in which Met4p is supposed to be less active. By hierarchically clustering the transcriptional profile of the sulfur metabolic genes as a time series up to 90 minutes following MET4 induction we were able to observe that the kinetics of MET4 target induction can vary from gene to gene .

The targets fell into three categories based on their kinetic profiles strongly induced group 1 weakly induced group 2 and uninduced group 3 . The MUP1 and MUP3 genes which encode the high and low affinity methionine permeases respectively and SAM1 and SAM2 which encode enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of S adenosylmethionine AdoMet are strongly induced group 1 genes. AdoMet is the primary source of methyl donor groups in the cell.

The MET31 and MET32 genes encode homologous zinc finger proteins 46 identical which aid in the recruitment of Met4p to many sulfur metabolic gene promoters. Unexpectedly while MET32 is weakly induced group 2 we do not detect any induction of MET31. While met31 and met32 mutant cells are able to produce their own methionine when grown on minimal medium met31 met32 double mutants are methionine auxotrophs. Despite the purported redundancy of these factors we were able to observe differential regulation in response to MET4 overexpression.

MET4 and MET31 genes were chosen for use in a proof of principle experiment to exemplify the protein depletion method . We constructed Ndeg modified MET4 and MET31 alleles in separate strains containing GEV and P TEV see Materials and Methods . Cells were grown in rich medium YPD and treated with 1 M estradiol at 2 10cells mL. Western blots were performed on proteins extracted at several time points after induction . Treatment of cultures with 1 M estradiol had no effect on levels of Met4p 13Myc or Met31p 13Myc lacking NDeg B . However 1 M estradiol treatment of NDeg MET4 or NDeg MET31 cells showed rapid reduction of the NDeg tagged proteins B . By performing a best fit of the data from 10 20 and 40 minute timepoints to a power law we find that the half life of NDeg Met4p 13Myc is 16 minutes and that of NDeg Met31p 13Myc is 13.75 minutes .

A met4 null allele has a growth defect and produces small colonies on YPD plates Hickman et al. 2011 . Therefore a diploid cell was used for construction of NDeg MET4. Sporulation of this diploid followed by dissection of the resulting tetrads showed that the spore colonies had the same wild type size confirming that the modified gene was functional.

Met4p is known to be ubiquitinated Rouillon et al. 2000 and is as a result unstable. Three clear bands were observed in our Met4p Western blots consistent with the presence of non ubiquitinated Met4p in addition to heavier ubiquitinated forms . When MET4 is tagged with NDeg both the ubiquitinated and non modified Met4p proteins are targeted for degradation by TEV .

Finally the phenotypic effect of estradiol treatment of NDeg MET4 containing cells was assayed. As expected only cells treated with estradiol displayed a methionine auxotrophy met phenotype as Met4p is required for methionine synthesis Masselot and Robichon Szulmajster 1975 .

The ZEV and 4ZEV transcriptional activators have the same hormone binding domain and activator domain as GEV but each has a different DNA binding domain. ZEV has the DNA binding domain of transcription factor zif268 and 4ZEV has a rationally designed four zinc fingers domain.

The performance of these protein transcription factors are shown in . shows the reporter plasmids used for characterizing the different expression systems. By placing the binding sites between restriction sites new binding sites can be cut and pasted with relative ease. Thus input output relationships can be easily tested for different DNA binding sequences. Importantly each of the three systems show a graded response and the use of non yeast DNA binding domains allows for more production of GFP FIG. A B presumably through a reduction in the errant transcriptional responses associated with the GEV system. Importantly the ZEV and 4ZEV systems eliminate the expression changes associated with the GEV system FIG. A B . Nonetheless each system strongly induces GFP and each system induces GFP transcripts 50 fold by 15 minutes following hormone addition . Finally by reducing the background expression of these new systems the growth defect associated with GEV is eliminated . This makes the new systems ideal for a variety of applications where 1 remaining inert with respect to the cell s overall physiology and 2 reducing background expression is of importance.

This system demonstrates that the hormone inducible transcriptional activator is an efficient switch that induces target genes to near maximal levels within minutes following hormone addition to the culture. A single cell visualization method was used to establish that GEV activation occurs by its rapid nuclear localization in the presence of estradiol. The system demonstrated that GEV overexpression results in minimal errant induction of genes in a gal1 background making it ideal for overexpression studies in

With the endogenous galactose utilization machinery deleted the results indicated that such a system a can be nearly gratuitous as indicated by genome wide profiling b is fast acting requiring only several minutes to activate transcription and c exhibits low translational noise.

GEV induces or represses relatively few genes in a gal10 gal1 gal4 background. A 3 hour time course of DBY12021 leu2 0 pACT1 GEV NatMX Pgal10 1 Gal1 loxP Gal4 LEU2 HAP1 following a pulse with estradiol showed that GEV mediated activation by estradiol affects relatively few genes in the genome less than 2 of the entire genome according to measurement by K means clustering of time course data.

The examples show that the GEV system configured in the manner of the invention satisfies the requirements of an effective gratuitous induction system. It can be used to both rapidly induce a target gene in every cell in the culture while conferring minimal induction of off target genes. GEV provides efficient induction. The range of transcription rates in measured in the literature ranges from 0.7 2 kb min Mand S2005 Zet al. 2008 the upper bound of which has been measured from a P driven gene Mand S2005 . If a gene is 2 kb in length and is downstream of P as in the case of P MET4 generating a full transcript should take 1 minute. By 2.5 minutes detectable amounts of P driven transcript were observed . By 2.5 minutes therefore the gene has gone through several rounds of transcription. By 5 minutes the amount of induction is near maximal.

In the localization experiments herein GEV GFP is detected in the nucleus at 6 8 min. following addition of estradiol to the media. If nuclear localization takes 6 8 min. it would appear surprising that full length transcripts are measured at 2.5 minutes following estradiol addition to the media. There are at least two potential explanations. First it can be accounted for if the GEV GFP fusion has slightly slower kinetics of nuclear localization than GEV. Second it can be accounted for if the kinetics of GEV GFP reflects the kinetics of GEV without the fluorescent tag but measurement of localization is too insensitive to detect the first few GEV GFP molecules that become localized to the nucleus and activate transcription.

One of the most significant advantages of the system is the potential for following the consequences of the induction of a specific protein dynamically. This is clearest in the case of a transcriptional regulator like Met4p. The induction kinetics allow us to distinguish primary from secondary targets and the cascade of consequences can be followed as time series that can shed light on the sequence of events under a variety of physiological conditions.

Through overexpression of MET4 the kinetics of induction of the sulfur metabolic genes was distinguishable . The kinetics of target induction can depend strongly on the choice of nutrient limitation i.e. phosphate versus methionine limitation . ChIP chip studies can show the presence or absence of transcription factor DNA interactions. They fail however to capture the strength and kinetics of induction of a particular gene in response to a single factor something that is readily measurable via GEV mediated overexpression of particular transcription factors.

By finding motifs in the promoters of genes that rapidly change expression in response to overexpression of a particular transcription factor we can potentially generate position weight matrices PWMs for factors with unknown DNA binding motifs. Another potential application is to refine known PWMs of better studied factors by complementing previous in vitro and context specific ChIP chip data with in vivo measurements that look for the presence of direct regulation through GEV mediated overexpression.

Upon removing estradiol from the media GEV GFP begins to delocalize within minutes . In the presence of estradiol cytoplasmic GEV binds estradiol and enters the nucleus at a rate k. Nucleus localized GEV is either bound to or unbound from DNA. Unbound GEV diffuses throughout the nucleus and exits the nucleus at a rate k. Since kapproaches 0 in the absence of estradiol we can immediately measure unbound GEV leaving the nucleus at rate k. However the true rate of nuclear delocalization of GEV includes the unbinding of GEV from DNA which can be much slower.

Given that the half life of GEV nuclear localization is 40 minutes and that protein half lives can be as large as days removing estradiol from the media is not an effective way to quickly deplete the levels of a target protein. Similarly methods that rely on blocking transcription upon addition of inducer to cells are not effective for rapidly depleting target proteins. These facts were the motivation to prepare a construct to drive the expression of TEV by GEV which allows for rapidly turning off target proteins containing an N degron sequence. This sequence can readily be added to genes via homologous recombination. Therefore we now have developed a method for rapidly shutting off the levels of single genes expressed from their native promoters. Upon estradiol addition and subsequent depletion of the target gene by TEV one can study the cell s transient physiological response such as the transcriptional profile to losing both essential and non essential genes. These types of studies assist to rigorously define the transcriptional regulatory network of essential genes in
