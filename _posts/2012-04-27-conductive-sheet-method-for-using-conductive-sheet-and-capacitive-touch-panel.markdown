The present invention is a Continuation in Part Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 384 199 filed on Jan. 13 2012 which is a 35 U.S.C. 371 National Stage Entry of PCT JP2010 071200 filed on Nov. 19 2010 which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2009 265467 filed on Nov. 20 2009 and 2010 125371 filed on May 31 2010 the contents of all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to a conductive sheet a method for using a conductive sheet and a capacitive touch panel and for example to a conductive sheet suitable for use in a projected capacitive touch panel a method for using a conductive sheet and a capacitive touch panel.

Common capacitive touch panels are position input devices capable of detecting a human finger touch position based on an electrostatic capacitance change between the finger and a conductive film. Such capacitive touch panels include surface capacitive touch panels and projected capacitive touch panels. The surface capacitive touch panel has a simple structure but is incapable of simultaneously detecting two or more touch points multi touch detection . On the other hand the projected capacitive touch panel has a structure containing a large number of electrodes arranged in a matrix similar to a pixel structure of a liquid crystal display device etc. More specifically the structure is such that a plurality of electrodes are arranged and connected in series in the vertical direction to form a first electrode array a plurality of the first electrode arrays are arranged in the horizontal direction a plurality of electrodes are arranged and connected in series in the horizontal direction to form a second electrode array a plurality of the second electrode arrays are arranged in the vertical direction and capacitance changes are sequentially detected by the first and second electrode arrays to achieve multi touch detection. Such conventional projected capacitive touch panels include a capacitive input device described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2008 310551.

However the capacitive input device described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2008 310551 is disadvantageously poor in finger position detection accuracy because it is necessary to form gaps between first and second electrode arrays arranged on one main surface of a substrate to prevent short circuit of the first and second electrode arrays. Furthermore the capacitive input device is disadvantageous in that electrode connections of the second electrode arrays are formed on electrode connections of the first electrode arrays with insulation layers in between to prevent short circuit of intersections cross points of the first and second electrode arrays whereby the intersections have large thicknesses and appear as local black points in the touch panel surface to significantly deteriorate the visibility. In addition mask patterns are required to form the insulation layers and the electrode connections thereon thereby resulting in complicated production process and high production cost.

The problems may be solved by using a structure containing the first electrode arrays formed on one main surface of a transparent substrate and the second electrode arrays formed on the other main surface thereof.

However this structure may cause the following problem in the future. Though the projected capacitive touch panel has currently been used mainly in small devices such as PDAs personal digital assistants and mobile phones the touch panel is expected to be used in large devices such as personal computer displays. This is because a standard operating system OS for a personal computer has recently been made compliant with a multi touch technology.

The electrodes used in the conventional projected capacitive touch panel are composed of ITO indium tin oxide and therefore have high resistance of several tens ohm sq. Thus when the touch panel is used in the large devices in the above future trend the large sized touch panel exhibits a low current transfer rate between the electrodes and thereby exhibits a low response speed a long time between finger contact and touch position detection .

In view of the above problems an object of the present invention is to provide a conductive sheet and a conductive sheet using method where the conductive sheet can have a low resistance conductive pattern on a substrate can exhibit an improved visibility and can be suitably used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a touch panel that can have a low resistance conductive pattern on a substrate can exhibit an improved visibility and can be suitably used as a large sized projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

As described above in the conductive sheet and the conductive sheet using method of the present invention the resistance of the conductive pattern formed on the substrate can be lowered the visibility can be improved and the conductive sheet can be suitably used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

Furthermore in the touch panel of the present invention the resistance of the conductive pattern formed on the substrate can be lowered the visibility can be improved and the touch panel can be suitably used as a large sized projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

Several embodiments of the conductive sheet the conductive sheet using method and the touch panel of the present invention will be described below with reference to . It should be noted that in this description a numeric range of A to B includes both the numeric values A and B as the lower limit and upper limit values.

As shown in a conductive sheet according to a first embodiment hereinafter referred to as the first conductive sheet A has a first conductive part A formed on one main surface of a first transparent substrate A shown in . The first conductive part A contains two or more conductive first large lattices A sense pads composed of a thin metal wire and further contains first connections A composed of a thin metal wire. Each adjacent two of the first large lattices A are electrically connected by the first connection A. The first large lattices A each contain a combination of two or more small lattices the first connections A each contain one or more medium lattices to and the pitch of the medium lattices is n times larger than that of the small lattices in which n is a real number larger than 1 . The small lattices have a smallest square shape. For example the thin metal wire contains gold Au silver Ag or copper Cu .

The side length of the first large lattice A is preferably 3 to 10 mm more preferably 4 to 6 mm. When the side length is less than the lower limit the electrostatic capacitance of the first large lattice A is lowered and a touch panel or the like using the first conductive sheet A is likely to cause a detection problem. On the other hand when the side length is more than the upper limit the position detection accuracy may be deteriorated. The side length of the small lattice in the first large lattice A is preferably 50 to 500 m more preferably 150 to 300 m for the same reasons. When the side length of the small lattice is within this range the first conductive sheet A has high transparency and thereby can be suitably used on the front surface of a display device with excellent visibility.

The two or more first large lattices A are arranged in an x direction a first direction with the first connections A disposed therebetween to form a first conductive pattern A composed of the thin metal wire. Two or more of the first conductive patterns A are arranged in a y direction a second direction perpendicular to the x direction. Electrically isolated first insulations A are disposed between the adjacent first conductive patterns A.

For example the x direction corresponds to the horizontal or vertical direction of a projected capacitive touch panel or a display panel equipped with the touch panel to be hereinafter described see .

As shown in among four sides of the first large lattice A a first side and a second side are on one corner not connected to the adjacent first large lattice A. A continuous straight line is formed along each of the first side and the second side and a large number of needle like lines sides of the small lattices extend from the straight line to form a comb like shape. Furthermore a third side and a fourth side are on the other corner not connected to the adjacent first large lattice A. A continuous straight line is formed along each of the third side and the fourth side and one small lattice is removed more specifically adjacent two sides are removed in the other corner

In the first connection A the four medium lattices the first medium lattice to the fourth medium lattice are arranged in a zigzag manner and each of the medium lattices has a size equal to the total size of four small lattices . The first medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the straight lines along the second side and the fourth side and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The second medium lattice is disposed on one side of the first medium lattice the straight line along the second side and forms a square space. Thus the shape of the second medium lattice is such that four small lattices are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The third medium lattice is adjacent to the first medium lattice and the second medium lattice and has the same shape as the second medium lattice . The fourth medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the first side and the second straight line along the third side the second straight line from the outside to the inside of the first large lattice A is adjacent to the second medium lattice and the third medium lattice and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice as well as the first medium lattice . One side of the fourth medium lattice is disposed on an extended line of the straight line along the fourth side of the first large lattice A. When the small lattices have an arrangement pitch Ps and the medium lattices have an arrangement pitch Pm of 2 Ps.

In one end of each first conductive pattern A the first connection A is not formed on the open end of the first large lattice A. In the other end of the first conductive pattern A the end of the first large lattice A is electrically connected to a first terminal wiring pattern composed of a thin metal wire by a first wire connection see .

As described above in the first conductive sheet A the two or more first large lattices A are arranged in the x direction with the first connections A disposed therebetween to form one first conductive pattern A the two or more small lattices are combined to form each first large lattice A the four medium lattices are arranged to form each first connection A and the pitch of the medium lattices is 2 times larger than that of the small lattices . As a result the first conductive sheet A can exhibit a significantly lowered electrical resistance as compared with conventional structures using one ITO film for one electrode. Thus when the first conductive sheet A is used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased.

A touch panel containing the above first conductive sheet A will be described below with reference to .

The touch panel has a sensor body and a control circuit such as an integrated circuit not shown . As shown in and A the sensor body contains a touch panel conductive sheet according to the first embodiment hereinafter referred to as the first laminated conductive sheet A and thereon a protective layer not shown in . The first laminated conductive sheet A is obtained by stacking the above first conductive sheet A and a second conductive sheet B to be hereinafter described. The first laminated conductive sheet A and the protective layer are disposed on a display panel of a display device such as a liquid crystal display. As viewed from above the sensor body has a sensing region corresponding to a display screen of the display panel and a terminal wiring region a so called frame corresponding to the periphery of the display panel .

As shown in in the first conductive sheet A used in the touch panel the above plural first conductive patterns A are arranged in the sensing region and the plural first terminal wiring patterns composed of the thin metal wire extend from the first wire connections in the terminal wiring region .

In the example of the first conductive sheet A and the sensing region each have a rectangle shape as viewed from above. In the terminal wiring region a plurality of first terminals are arranged in the longitudinal center in the length direction of the periphery on one longer side of the first conductive sheet A. The plural first wire connections are arranged in a straight line in the y direction along one longer side of the sensing region a longer side closest to the one longer side of the first conductive sheet A . The first terminal wiring pattern lead from each first wire connection is drawn to the center of the one longer side of the first conductive sheet A and is electrically connected to the corresponding first terminal . Thus the first terminal wiring patterns connected to each pair of corresponding first wire connections formed on the right and left of the one longer side of the sensing region have approximately the same lengths. Of course the first terminals may be formed in a corner of the first conductive sheet A or the vicinity thereof. However in this case the length difference between the longest first terminal wiring pattern and the shortest first terminal wiring pattern is increased whereby the longest first terminal wiring pattern and the first terminal wiring patterns in the vicinity thereof are disadvantageously poor in the rate of transferring a signal to the corresponding first conductive pattern A. Thus in this embodiment the first terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the one longer side of the first conductive sheet A whereby the local signal transfer rate deterioration is prevented resulting in increase in the response speed.

As shown in and A the second conductive sheet B has a second conductive part B formed on one main surface of a second transparent substrate B. The second conductive part B contains two or more conductive second large lattices B sense pads composed of a thin metal wire and further contains second connections B composed of a thin metal wire. Each adjacent two of the second large lattices B are electrically connected by the second connection B. As shown in the second large lattices B each contain a combination of two or more small lattices the second connections B each contain one or more medium lattices and the pitch of the medium lattices is n times larger than that of the small lattices in which n is a real number larger than 1 . The side length of the second large lattice B is preferably 3 to 10 mm more preferably 4 to 6 mm as well as the first large lattice A.

The two or more second large lattices B are arranged in the y direction the second direction with the second connections B disposed therebetween to form one second conductive pattern B composed of the thin metal wire. Two or more of the second conductive patterns B are arranged in the x direction the first direction perpendicular to the y direction. Electrically isolated second insulations B are disposed between the adjacent second conductive patterns B.

As shown in for example in one end of each alternate odd numbered second conductive pattern B and in the other end of each even numbered second conductive pattern B the second connection B is not formed on the open end of the second large lattice B. In the other end of each odd numbered second conductive pattern B and in one end of each even numbered second conductive pattern B the end of the second large lattice B is electrically connected to a second terminal wiring pattern composed of a thin metal wire by a second wire connection

The plural second conductive patterns B are arranged in the sensing region the plural second terminal wiring patterns being lead from the second wire connections in the terminal wiring region .

As shown in in the terminal wiring region a plurality of second terminals are arranged in the longitudinal center in the length direction of the periphery on one longer side of the second conductive sheet B. For example the plural odd numbered second wire connections are arranged in a straight line in the x direction along one shorter side of the sensing region a shorter side closest to one shorter side of the second conductive sheet B and the plural even numbered second wire connections are arranged in a straight line in the x direction along the other shorter side of the sensing region a shorter side closest to the other shorter side of the second conductive sheet B .

For example each odd numbered second conductive pattern B is connected to the corresponding odd numbered second wire connection and each even numbered second conductive pattern B is connected to the corresponding even numbered second wire connection . The second terminal wiring patterns lead from the odd numbered and even numbered second wire connections to the center of one longer side of the second conductive sheet B and are electrically connected to the corresponding second terminals . Thus for example the first and second ones of the second terminal wiring patterns have approximately the same lengths and similarly the 2n 1 th and 2n th second terminal wiring patterns have approximately the same lengths n 1 2 3 . . . .

Of course the second terminals may be formed in a corner of the second conductive sheet B or the vicinity thereof. However in this case as described above the longest second terminal wiring pattern and the second terminal wiring patterns in the vicinity thereof are disadvantageously poor in the rate of transferring a signal to the corresponding second conductive pattern B. Thus in this embodiment the second terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the one longer side of the second conductive sheet B whereby the local signal transfer rate deterioration is prevented resulting in increase in the response speed.

The first terminal wiring patterns may be arranged in the same manner as the above second terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns may be arranged in the same manner as the above first terminal wiring patterns

When the first laminated conductive sheet A is used in a touch panel a protective layer is formed on the first conductive sheet A and the first terminal wiring patterns lead from the plural first conductive patterns A in the first conductive sheet A and the second terminal wiring patterns lead from the plural second conductive patterns B in the second conductive sheet B are connected to a scan control circuit or the like.

A self or mutual capacitance technology can be preferably used for detecting a touch position. In the self capacitance technology a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the first conductive patterns A and further a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the second conductive patterns B. When a finger comes into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer the capacitance between the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B in the touch position and the GND ground is increased whereby signals from this first conductive pattern A and this second conductive pattern B have a waveform different from those of signals from the other conductive patterns. Thus the touch position is calculated by a control circuit based on the signals transmitted from the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B. On the other hand in the mutual capacitance technology for example a voltage signal for the touch position detection is sequentially supplied to the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are sequentially subjected to sensing transmitted signal detection . When a finger comes into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer the parallel stray capacitance of the finger is added to the parasitic capacitance between the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B in the touch position whereby a signal from this second conductive pattern B has a waveform different from those of signals from the other second conductive patterns B. Thus the touch position is calculated by a control circuit based on the order of the first conductive patterns A supplied with the voltage signal and the signal transmitted from the second conductive pattern B. Even when two fingers come into contact with or close to the upper surface of the protective layer simultaneously the touch positions can be detected by using the self or mutual capacitance technology selected. Conventional related detection circuits used in projected capacitive technologies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 582 955 4 686 332 4 733 222 5 374 787 5 543 588 and 7 030 860 US Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0155871 etc.

As shown in among four sides of the second large lattice B in the second conductive pattern B a fifth side and a sixth side are on one corner not connected to the adjacent second large lattice B. The fifth side is similar to the first side of the first large lattice A in the first conductive sheet A a continuous straight line is formed along the fifth side and a large number of needle like lines sides of the small lattices extend from the straight line to form a comb like shape. The sixth side is similar to the third side of the first large lattice A in the first conductive sheet A and a continuous straight line is formed along the sixth side . Furthermore a seventh side and an eighth side are on the other corner not connected to the adjacent second large lattice B. The seventh side is similar to the fifth side a continuous straight line is formed along the seventh side and a large number of needle like lines sides of the small lattices extend from the straight line to form a comb like shape. The eighth side is similar to the sixth side and a continuous straight line is formed along the eighth side

In the second connection B the four medium lattices the fifth medium lattice to the eighth medium lattice are arranged in a zigzag manner and each of the medium lattices has a size equal to the total size of four small lattices . The fifth medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the second straight line along the sixth side the second straight line from the outside to the inside of the second large lattice B and the straight line along the eighth side and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The sixth medium lattice is disposed on one side of the fifth medium lattice the second straight line along the sixth side and forms a square space. Thus the shape of the sixth medium lattice is such that four small lattices are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The seventh medium lattice is adjacent to the fifth medium lattice and the sixth medium lattice and has the same shape as the sixth medium lattice . The eighth medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the fifth side and the straight line along the seventh side is adjacent to the sixth medium lattice and the seventh medium lattice and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice as the fifth medium lattice . One side of the eighth medium lattice is disposed on an extended line of the straight line along the eighth side in the fifth medium lattice . Also in the second conductive sheet B when the small lattices have an arrangement pitch Ps the medium lattices have an arrangement pitch Pm of 2 Ps.

For example as shown in when the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the first laminated conductive sheet A the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see in between. Also the first insulations A between the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B between the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A in between. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines respectively to clearly represent the positions thereof in they have the same line width.

When the stacked first conductive sheet A and second conductive sheet B are observed from above the spaces between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A are filled with the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B. Thus the surface is covered with the large lattices. In this observation the ends of the comb teeth on the first sides and the second sides of the first large lattices A are connected to the straight lines along the sixth sides and the eighth sides of the second large lattices B so that the small lattices are arranged over the stack. Similarly the ends of the comb teeth on the fifth sides and the seventh sides of the second large lattices B are connected to the straight lines along the third sides and the fourth sides of the first large lattices A so that the small lattices are arranged over the stack. As a result the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B cannot be easily found.

For example in a case where all the sides of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are formed in the shapes of the straight lines i.e. where the open ends of the lines extending from the first side and the second side of each first large lattice A are connected to form straight lines and also the open ends of the lines extending from the fifth side and the seventh side of each second large lattice B are connected to form straight lines the overlaps of the straight lines have large widths the lines are thickened due to slight deterioration of stack position accuracy whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are highly visible deteriorating the visibility disadvantageously. In contrast in this embodiment the ends of the comb teeth overlap with the straight line as described above whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are made less visible to improve the visibility. Though an opening having a size equal to one medium lattice is formed in each overlap of the first insulation A and the second insulation B the opening does not block a light and is less visible unlike the above thickened line. Particularly when the opening has the same size as the medium lattice the opening is not significantly larger than the surrounding small lattices and thereby is less visible.

Furthermore in the case where all the first sides to the eighth sides of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are formed in the shapes of the straight lines the straight lines along the fifth sides to the eighth sides of the second large lattices B are positioned right under the straight lines along the first sides to the fourth sides of the first large lattices A. In this case the straight lines function as conductive portions parasitic capacitances are formed between the sides of the first large lattices A and the sides of the second large lattices B and the parasitic capacitances act as noises on charge information significantly deteriorating the S N ratio. Furthermore since the parasitic capacitances are formed between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B a large number of the parasitic capacitances are connected in parallel in the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B to increase the CR time constant disadvantageously. When the CR time constant is increased there is a possibility that the waveform rise time of the voltage signal supplied to the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B is increased and an electric field for the position detection is hardly generated in a predetermined scan time. In addition there is a possibility that the waveform rise or fall time of the signal transmitted from each of the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B is increased and the waveform change of the transmitted signal cannot be detected in a predetermined scan time. This leads to detection accuracy deterioration and response speed deterioration. Thus in this case the detection accuracy and the response speed can be improved only by reducing the number of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B lowering the resolution or by reducing the size of the display screen and the laminated conductive sheet cannot be used in a large screen such as a B5 sized A4 sized or larger screen.

In contrast in this embodiment as shown in the projected distance Lf between the straight line along a side of the first large lattice A and the straight line along a side of the second large lattice B is approximately equal to the side length of the small lattice 50 to 500 m . Furthermore only the ends of the needle like lines extending from the first side and the second side of the first large lattice A overlap with the straight lines along the sixth side and the eighth side of the second large lattice B and only the ends of the needle like lines extending from the fifth side and the seventh side of the second large lattice B overlap with the straight lines along the third side and the fourth side of the first large lattice A. Therefore only a small parasitic capacitance is formed between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B. As a result the CR time constant can be reduced to improve the detection accuracy and the response speed.

It is preferred that the optimum value of the projected distance Lf is appropriately selected depending not on the sizes of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B but on the sizes the line widths and the side lengths of the small lattices . When the small lattices have an excessively large size in view of the sizes of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B the first laminated conductive sheet A may have a high light transmittance but the dynamic range of the transmitted signal may be reduced to lower the detection sensitivity. On the other hand when the small lattices have an excessively small size the first laminated conductive sheet A may have a high detection sensitivity but the light transmittance may be deteriorated under the restriction of line width reduction.

When the small lattices have a line width of 1 to 9 m the optimum value of the projected distance Lf the optimum distance is preferably 100 to 400 m more preferably 200 to 300 m. In a case where the small lattices have a smaller line width the optimum distance can be further reduced. However in this case the electrical resistance may be increased and the CR time constant may be increased even under a small parasitic capacitance deteriorating the detection sensitivity and the response speed. Thus the line width of the small lattice is preferably within the above range.

For example the sizes of the first large lattices A the second large lattices B and the small lattices are determined based on the size of the display panel or the size and touch position detection resolution drive pulse period of the sensing region and the optimum distance between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B is obtained based on the line width of the small lattices .

When the overlaps of the first connections A and the second connections B are observed from above the connection point of the fifth medium lattice and the seventh medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the second medium lattice in the first connection A the connection point of the sixth medium lattice and the eighth medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the third medium lattice in the first connection A and the first medium lattices to the eighth medium lattices form a plurality of the small lattices in combination. Therefore the plural small lattices are formed by the combination of the first connections A and the second connections B in the overlaps. Thus formed small lattices cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the visibility is improved.

In this embodiment in the terminal wiring region the plural first terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the periphery on the one longer side of the first conductive sheet A and the plural second terminals are formed in the longitudinal center of the periphery on the one longer side of the second conductive sheet B. Particularly in the example of the first terminals and the second terminals are close to each other and do not overlap with each other and the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns do not overlap with each other. For example the first terminal may partially overlap with the odd numbered second terminal wiring pattern

Thus the plural first terminals and the plural second terminals can be electrically connected to the control circuit by using a cable and two connectors a connector for the first terminals and a connector for the second terminals or one connector a complex connector for the first terminals and the second terminals .

Since the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns do not vertically overlap with each other a parasitic capacitance is reduced therebetween to prevent the response speed deterioration.

Since the first wire connections are arranged along the one longer side of the sensing region and the second wire connections are arranged along the both shorter sides of the sensing region the area of the terminal wiring region can be reduced. Therefore the size of the display panel containing the touch panel can be easily reduced and the display screen can be made to seem larger. Also the operability of the touch panel as a touch sensor can be improved.

The area of the terminal wiring region may be further reduced by reducing the distance between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns or the adjacent second terminal wiring patterns . The distance is preferably 10 to 50 m in view of preventing migration.

Alternatively the area of the terminal wiring region may be reduced by arranging the second terminal wiring pattern between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns in the view from above. However when the pattern is misarranged the first terminal wiring pattern may vertically overlap with the second terminal wiring pattern to increase the parasitic capacitance therebetween. This leads to deterioration of the response speed. Thus in the case of using such an arrangement the distance between the adjacent first terminal wiring patterns is preferably 50 to 100 m.

As described above when the first laminated conductive sheet A is used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased. Furthermore the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B are less visible and the first connections A and the second connections B form the plural small lattices in combination so that defects such as local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved.

Furthermore the CR time constant of the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B can be significantly reduced whereby the response speed can be increased and the position detection can be readily carried out in an operation time a scan time . Thus the screen sizes not the thickness but the length and width of the touch panel can be easily increased.

As shown in in the above first laminated conductive sheet A the first conductive patterns A are formed on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B are formed on the one main surface of the second transparent substrate B. Alternatively as shown in the structure of the first laminated conductive sheet A may be such that the first conductive patterns A are formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B are formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A. In this case the second transparent substrate B is not used the first transparent substrate A is stacked on the second conductive part B and the first conductive part A is stacked on the first transparent substrate A. In addition another layer may be formed between the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B may be arranged facing each other as long as they are insulated.

As shown in first alignment marks and second alignment marks are preferably formed on the corners etc. of the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The first alignment marks and the second alignment marks are used for positioning the sheets in the process of bonding the sheets. When the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are bonded to obtain the first laminated conductive sheet A the first alignment marks and the second alignment marks form composite alignment marks. The composite alignment marks are used for positioning in the process of attaching the first laminated conductive sheet A to the display panel .

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a second embodiment hereinafter referred to as the second laminated conductive sheet B will be described below with reference to .

As shown in the second laminated conductive sheet B has approximately the same structure as the above first laminated conductive sheet A. The second laminated conductive sheet B is different from the first laminated conductive sheet A in that two or more rectangles are arranged to form a rectangular wave shape on each of the first sides to the fourth sides of the first large lattices A as shown in and that two or more rectangles are arranged to form a rectangular wave shape on each of the fifth sides to the eighth sides of the second large lattices B as shown in .

Specifically as shown in the first large lattice A in the second laminated conductive sheet B is such that each alternate comb tooth on the first side and the second side of the first large lattice A in the first conductive sheet A shown in is connected to the next comb tooth to form the small lattice and each straight line on the third side and the fourth side is separated in the alternate small lattices whereby the two or more rectangles are arranged to form the rectangular wave shape on each of the first sides to the fourth sides . Particularly in the first large lattice A the rectangles on the first side are alternated with those on the fourth side facing the first side and the rectangles on the second side are alternated with those on the third side facing the second side

Similarly as shown in the second large lattice B in the second laminated conductive sheet B is such that each alternate comb tooth on the fifth side and the seventh side of the second large lattice B in the second conductive sheet B shown in is connected to the next comb tooth to form the small lattice and each straight line on the sixth side and the eighth side is separated in the alternate small lattices whereby the two or more rectangles are arranged to form the rectangular wave shape on each of the fifth sides to the eighth sides . Particularly in the second large lattice B the rectangles on the fifth side are alternated with those on the eighth side facing the fifth side and the rectangles on the sixth side are alternated with those on the seventh side facing the sixth side

For example as shown in when the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the second laminated conductive sheet B as in the first laminated conductive sheet A see the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see in between and also the first insulations A between the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B between the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A in between. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines respectively to clearly represent the positions thereof in as well as they have the same line width.

When the stacked first conductive sheet A and second conductive sheet B are observed from above the spaces between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A are filled with the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B. In this observation the opening of each concave on the rectangular wave shapes of the first sides and the second sides in the first large lattices A are connected to the end of each convex on the rectangular wave shapes of the sixth sides and the eighth sides in the second large lattices B so that the small lattices are continuously arranged over the stack. Similarly the opening of each concave on the rectangular wave shapes of the third sides and the fourth sides in the first large lattices A are connected to the end of each convex on the rectangular wave shapes of the fifth sides and the seventh sides in the second large lattices B so that the small lattices are continuously arranged over the stack. As a result the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B cannot be easily found. Thus the openings of the concaves overlap with the ends of the convexes in the rectangular wave shapes whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are less visible to improve the visibility. Though a cross shaped opening is formed in each overlap of the first insulation A and the second insulation B the opening does not block a light and is less visible unlike the above thickened line.

In the overlaps of the first connections A and the second connections B in the second laminated conductive sheet B as in the first laminated conductive sheet A the connection point of the fifth medium lattice and the seventh medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the second medium lattice in the first connection A the connection point of the sixth medium lattice and the eighth medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the third medium lattice in the first connection A and the first medium lattices to the eighth medium lattices form a plurality of the small lattices in combination. Therefore the plural small lattices are formed by the combination of the first connections A and the second connections B in the overlaps. Thus formed small lattices cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the visibility is improved.

Though not shown in the drawings the arrangement of the first wire connections and the second wire connections the arrangement of the first terminal wiring patterns and the second terminal wiring patterns in the terminal wiring region and the arrangement of the first terminals and the second terminals in the second laminated conductive sheet B are equal to those in the first laminated conductive sheet A.

Thus when the second laminated conductive sheet B is used in the projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased. Furthermore the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B are less visible and the first connections A and the second connections B form the plural small lattices in combination so that defects such as local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved.

Particularly in the second laminated conductive sheet B the four sides the first side to the fourth side of the first large lattice A and the four sides the fifth side to the eighth side of the second large lattice B have the equivalent rectangular wave shapes whereby charge localization in the ends of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B can be reduced to prevent false finger position detection.

Also in the second laminated conductive sheet as shown in the projected distance Lf between the straight line along a side of the first large lattice A and the straight line along a side of the second large lattice B is approximately equal to the side length of the small lattice 50 to 500 m . Furthermore only the rectangle corners in the rectangular wave shapes on the sides of the first large lattice A overlap with the rectangle corners in the rectangular wave shapes on the sides of the second large lattice B whereby only a small parasitic capacitance is formed between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B. As a result also the CR time constant can be reduced to improve the detection accuracy and the response speed.

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a third embodiment hereinafter referred to as the third laminated conductive sheet C will be described below with reference to .

The third laminated conductive sheet C has approximately the same structure as the above first laminated conductive sheet A. The third laminated conductive sheet C is different from the first laminated conductive sheet A in that a first auxiliary line of a thin metal wire separated from the first large lattices A is formed in each first insulation A of the first conductive part A in the first conductive sheet A as shown in and that a second auxiliary line of a thin metal wire separated from the second large lattices B is formed in each second insulation B of the second conductive part B in the second conductive sheet B as shown in .

As shown in the first auxiliary line extends in the third direction the m direction bisecting the angle between the first direction the x direction and the second direction the y direction and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice . As shown in the second auxiliary line extends in the fourth direction the n direction perpendicular to the third direction the m direction and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice .

For example as shown in when the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the third laminated conductive sheet C as in the first laminated conductive sheet A see the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see in between and also the first insulations A between the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B between the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A in between. Particularly the combined pattern of the first insulation A and the second insulation B is such that the first auxiliary line and the second auxiliary line are perpendicularly crossed and do not overlap with the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B.

Thus in the third laminated conductive sheet C the combined patterns of the first insulations A the first auxiliary lines and the second insulations B the second auxiliary lines are arranged between the first conductive patterns A and between the second conductive patterns B so that the openings having the same size as the medium lattice are not formed between the first conductive patterns A and between the second conductive patterns B and the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are less visible. Particularly since the first auxiliary line and the second auxiliary line are perpendicularly crossed in the combined pattern the appearance of the combined pattern is such that four small lattices are arranged in a matrix. Therefore the appearance of the third laminated conductive sheet C is such that the entire surface is covered with a large number of the small lattices . This appearance is preferred from the viewpoint of improving the visibility. Furthermore since the first auxiliary line is not connected to the first conductive patterns A and the second auxiliary line is not connected to the second conductive patterns B the first conductive patterns A can be electrically insulated from each other and the second conductive patterns B can be electrically insulated from each other.

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a fourth embodiment hereinafter referred to as the fourth laminated conductive sheet D will be described below with reference to .

The fourth laminated conductive sheet D has approximately the same structure as the above second laminated conductive sheet B. The fourth laminated conductive sheet D is different from the second laminated conductive sheet B in that a first auxiliary line separated from the first large lattices A is formed in each first insulation A of the first conductive part A in the first conductive sheet A as shown in and that a second auxiliary line separated from the second large lattices B is formed in each second insulation B of the second conductive part B in the second conductive sheet B as shown in .

As shown in the first auxiliary line extends in the third direction the m direction and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice . As shown in the second auxiliary line extends in the fourth direction the n direction and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice .

Thus as shown in also in the fourth laminated conductive sheet D the combined pattern of the first insulation A and the second insulation B is such that the first auxiliary line and the second auxiliary line are perpendicularly crossed and do not overlap with the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B. Therefore the cross shaped openings having the same size as a plurality of the small lattices arranged in an approximately cross shape are not formed between the first conductive patterns A and between the second conductive patterns B and the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are less visible. As a result the appearance of the fourth laminated conductive sheet D is such that the entire surface is covered with a large number of the small lattices . This appearance is preferred from the viewpoint of improving the visibility. Furthermore the first conductive patterns A can be electrically insulated from each other and the second conductive patterns B can be electrically insulated from each other.

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a fifth embodiment hereinafter referred to as the fifth laminated conductive sheet E will be described below with reference to .

The fifth laminated conductive sheet E has approximately the same structure as the above first laminated conductive sheet A and is different from the first laminated conductive sheet A in that the small lattices have a rhombic shape as shown in . In relation thereto also the first large lattices A the second large lattices B and the medium lattices have rhombic shapes. Furthermore as in the above third laminated conductive sheet C the first auxiliary line separated from the first large lattices A is formed in each first insulation A see and the second auxiliary line separated from the second large lattices B is formed in each second insulation B see .

As shown in the first auxiliary line extends along a side of the first large lattice A and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice . The first auxiliary line extends obliquely to the upper right in the example of . As shown in the second auxiliary line extends along a side of the second large lattice B and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice . The second auxiliary line extends obliquely to the lower right in the example of .

For example as shown in when the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the fifth laminated conductive sheet E as in the third laminated conductive sheet C see the combined pattern of the first insulation A and the second insulation B is such that the first auxiliary line and the second auxiliary line are crossed at an angle approximately equal to the vertex angle of the rhomboid of the small lattice and do not overlap with the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B.

Thus in the fifth laminated conductive sheet E the combined patterns of the first insulations A the first auxiliary lines and the second insulations B the second auxiliary lines are arranged between the first conductive patterns A and between the second conductive patterns B so that the openings having the same size as the rhombic medium lattice are not formed between the first conductive patterns A and between the second conductive patterns B and the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are less visible. Particularly since the first auxiliary line and the second auxiliary line are crossed at the angle approximately equal to the vertex angle of the rhomboid of the small lattice in the combined pattern the appearance of the combined pattern is such that four rhombic small lattices are arranged in a matrix. Therefore the appearance of the fifth laminated conductive sheet E is such that the entire surface is covered with a large number of the small lattices . This appearance is preferred from the viewpoint of improving the visibility. Furthermore since the first auxiliary line is not connected to the first conductive patterns A and the second auxiliary line is not connected to the second conductive patterns B the first conductive patterns A can be electrically insulated from each other and the second conductive patterns B can be electrically insulated from each other.

A touch panel conductive sheet according to a sixth embodiment hereinafter referred to as the sixth laminated conductive sheet F will be described below with reference to .

The sixth laminated conductive sheet F has approximately the same structure as the above second laminated conductive sheet B. The sixth laminated conductive sheet F is different from the second laminated conductive sheet B in that the small lattices the first large lattices A the second large lattices B and the medium lattices have rhombic shapes as shown in and that the first auxiliary line separated from the first large lattices A is formed in each first insulation A see and the second auxiliary line separated from the second large lattices B is formed in each second insulation B see as in the above fourth laminated conductive sheet D.

As shown in the first auxiliary line extends along a side of the first large lattice A and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice . As shown in the second auxiliary line extends along a side of the second large lattice B and has a length equal to the side length of the small lattice .

Thus in the sixth laminated conductive sheet F as in the fifth laminated conductive sheet E the first auxiliary line and the second auxiliary line are crossed at the angle approximately equal to the vertex angle of the rhomboid of the small lattice and do not overlap with the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B. Therefore the cross shaped openings having the same size as a plurality of the small lattices arranged in an approximately cross shape are not formed between the first conductive patterns A and between the second conductive patterns B and the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are less visible. As a result the appearance of the sixth laminated conductive sheet F is such that the entire surface is covered with a large number of the small lattices . This appearance is preferred from the viewpoint of improving the visibility. Furthermore the first conductive patterns A can be electrically insulated from each other and the second conductive patterns B can be electrically insulated from each other.

Though the arrangement pitch Pm of the medium lattices in the first connections A and the second connections B is twice larger than the arrangement pitch Ps of the small lattices in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of the above embodiments the pitch Pm may be appropriately selected depending on the number of the medium lattices . For example the pitch Pm may be 1.5 or 3 times larger than the pitch Ps. When the pitch Pm of the medium lattices is excessively small or large it may be difficult to arrange the large lattices resulting in poor appearance. Thus the pitch Pm is preferably 1 to 10 times more preferably 1 to 5 times further preferably 3 to 5 times larger than the pitch Ps of the small lattices .

Also the sizes of the small lattices including the side length the diagonal line length and the rhomboid vertex angle the number of the small lattices in the first large lattice A and the number of the small lattices in the second large lattice B may be appropriately selected depending on the size and the resolution the line number of the touch panel using the conductive sheet.

Though the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B are used in the projected capacitive touch panel in the above embodiments they can be used in a surface capacitive touch panel or a resistive touch panel.

The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B may be produced as follows. For example a photosensitive material having the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and thereon a photosensitive silver halide containing emulsion layer may be exposed and developed whereby metallic silver portions and light transmitting portions may be formed in the exposed areas and the unexposed areas respectively to obtain the first conductive patterns A or the second conductive patterns B. The metallic silver portions may be subjected to a physical development treatment and or a plating treatment to deposit a conductive metal thereon.

Alternatively a photoresist film on a copper foil formed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B may be exposed and developed to form a resist pattern and the copper foil exposed from the resist pattern may be etched to obtain the first conductive patterns A or the second conductive patterns B.

Alternatively a paste containing fine metal particles may be printed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and the printed paste may be plated with a metal to obtain the first conductive patterns A or the second conductive patterns B.

The first conductive patterns A or the second conductive patterns B may be printed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B by using a screen or gravure printing plate.

The first conductive patterns A or the second conductive patterns B may be formed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B by using an inkjet method.

A particularly preferred method which contains using a photographic photosensitive silver halide material for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B according to an embodiment of the present invention will be mainly described below.

The method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment includes the following three processes depending on the photosensitive materials and development treatments.

 1 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei to a chemical or thermal development to form the metallic silver portions on the photosensitive material.

 2 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing physical development nuclei to a solution physical development to form the metallic silver portions on the photosensitive material.

 3 A process comprising subjecting a stack of a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei and an image receiving sheet having a non photosensitive layer containing physical development nuclei to a diffusion transfer development to form the metallic silver portions on the non photosensitive image receiving sheet.

In the process of 1 an integral black and white development procedure is used to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. The resulting silver is a chemically or thermally developed silver containing a high specific surface area filament and thereby shows a high activity in the following plating or physical development treatment.

In the process of 2 the silver halide particles are melted around the physical development nuclei and deposited on the nuclei in the exposed areas to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. Also in this process an integral black and white development procedure is used. Though high activity can be achieved since the silver halide is deposited on the physical development nuclei in the development the developed silver has a spherical shape with small specific surface.

In the process of 3 the silver halide particles are melted in the unexposed areas and diffused and deposited on the development nuclei of the image receiving sheet to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the sheet. In this process a so called separate type procedure is used and the image receiving sheet is peeled off from the photosensitive material.

A negative or reversal development treatment can be used in the processes. In the diffusion transfer development the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto positive photosensitive material.

The chemical development thermal development solution physical development and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin ichi Kikuchi Kyoritsu Shuppan Co. Ltd. 1955 and C. E. K. Mees 4. Mcmillan 1977. A liquid treatment is generally used in the present invention and also a thermal development treatment can be utilized. For example techniques described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 2004 184693 2004 334077 and 2005 010752 and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004 244080 and 2004 085655 can be used in the present invention.

The structure of each layer in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment will be described in detail below.

The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B may be a plastic film a plastic plate a glass plate etc.

Examples of materials for the plastic film and the plastic plate include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates PET and polyethylene naphthalates polyolefins such as polyethylenes PE polypropylenes PP polystyrenes and EVA vinyl resins polycarbonates PC polyamides polyimides acrylic resins and triacetyl celluloses TAC .

The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably a film or plate of a plastic having a melting point of about 290 C. or lower such as PET melting point 258 C. PEN melting point 269 C. PE melting point 135 C. PP melting point 163 C. polystyrene melting point 230 C. polyvinyl chloride melting point 180 C. polyvinylidene chloride melting point 212 C. or TAC melting point 290 C. . The PET is particularly preferred from the viewpoints of light transmittance workability etc. The conductive film such as the first conductive sheet A or the second conductive sheet B used in the first laminated conductive sheet A or the second laminated conductive sheet B is required to be transparent and therefore the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B preferably have a high transparency.

The silver salt emulsion layer to be converted to the conductive layer in the first conductive sheet A or the second conductive sheet B the conductive portions including the first large lattices A the first connections A the second large lattices B the second connections B and the small lattices contains a silver salt and a binder and may contain a solvent and an additive such as a dye in addition thereto.

The silver salt used in this embodiment may be an inorganic silver salt such as a silver halide or an organic silver salt such as silver acetate. In this embodiment the silver halide is preferred because of its excellent light sensing property.

The applied silver amount the amount of the applied silver salt in the silver density of the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 1 to 30 g m more preferably 1 to 25 g m further preferably 5 to 20 g m. When the applied silver amount is within this range the resultant first laminated conductive sheet A or second laminated conductive sheet B can exhibit a desired surface resistance.

Examples of the binders used in this embodiment include gelatins polyvinyl alcohols PVA polyvinyl pyrolidones PVP polysaccharides such as starches celluloses and derivatives thereof polyethylene oxides polyvinylamines chitosans polylysines polyacrylic acids polyalginic acids polyhyaluronic acids and carboxycelluloses. The binders show a neutral anionic or cationic property depending on the ionicity of a functional group.

In this embodiment the amount of the binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected to obtain sufficient dispersion and adhesion properties. The volume ratio of silver binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 1 4 or more more preferably 1 2 or more. Furthermore the silver binder volume ratio is preferably 100 1 or less more preferably 50 1 or less. Particularly the silver binder volume ratio is further preferably 1 1 to 4 1 most preferably 1 1 to 3 1. When the silver binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer is within the range the resistance variation can be reduced even under various applied silver amount. Thus the first laminated conductive sheet A or the second laminated conductive sheet B can be produced with a uniform surface resistance. The silver binder volume ratio can be obtained by converting the silver halide binder weight ratio of the material to the silver binder weight ratio and by further converting the silver binder weight ratio to the silver binder volume ratio.

The solvent used for forming the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and Examples thereof include water organic solvents e.g. alcohols such as methanol ketones such as acetone amides such as formamide sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide esters such as ethyl acetate ethers ionic liquids and mixtures thereof.

In this embodiment the ratio of the solvent to the total of the silver salt the binder and the like in the silver salt emulsion layer is 30 to 90 by mass preferably 50 to 80 by mass.

The additives used in this embodiment are not particularly limited and may be preferably selected from known additives.

A protective layer not shown may be formed on the silver salt emulsion layer. The protective layer used in this embodiment contains a binder such as a gelatin or a high molecular polymer and is disposed on the photosensitive silver salt emulsion layer to improve the scratch prevention or mechanical property. The thickness of the protective layer is preferably 0.5 m or less. The method of applying or forming the protective layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from known applying or forming methods. In addition an undercoat layer or the like may be formed below the silver salt emulsion layer.

The steps for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B will be described below.

In this embodiment the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B may be formed in a printing process and they may be formed by exposure and development treatments etc. in another process. Thus a photosensitive material having the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and thereon the silver salt containing layer or a photosensitive material coated with a photopolymer for photolithography is subjected to the exposure treatment. An electromagnetic wave may be used in the exposure. For example the electromagnetic wave may be a light such as a visible light or an ultraviolet light or a radiation ray such as an X ray. The exposure may be carried out using a light source having a wavelength distribution or a specific wavelength.

In this embodiment the emulsion layer is subjected to the development treatment after the exposure. Common development treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used in the present invention. The developer used in the development treatment is not particularly limited and may be a PQ developer an MQ developer an MAA developer etc. Examples of commercially available developers usable in the present invention include CN 16 CR 56 CP45X FD 3 and PAPITOL available from FUJIFILM Corporation C 41 E 6 RA 4 D 19 and D 72 available from Eastman Kodak Company and developers contained in kits thereof. The developer may be a lith developer.

In the present invention the development process may include a fixation treatment for removing the silver salt in the unexposed areas to stabilize the material. Fixation treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used in the present invention.

In the fixation treatment the fixation temperature is preferably about 20 C. to 50 C. more preferably 25 C. to 45 C. The fixation time is preferably 5 seconds to 1 minute more preferably 7 to 50 seconds. The amount of the fixer is preferably 600 ml mor less more preferably 500 ml mor less particularly preferably 300 ml mor less per 1 mof the photosensitive material treated.

The developed and fixed photosensitive material is preferably subjected to a water washing treatment or a stabilization treatment. The amount of water used in the water washing or stabilization treatment is generally 20 L or less and may be 3 L or less per 1 mof the photosensitive material. The water amount may be 0 and thus the photosensitive material may be washed with storage water.

The ratio of the metallic silver contained in the exposed areas after the development to the silver contained in the areas before the exposure is preferably 50 or more more preferably 80 or more by mass. When the ratio is 50 or more by mass a high conductivity can be achieved.

In this embodiment the tone gradation obtained by the development is preferably more than 4.0 though not particularly restrictive. When the tone is more than 4.0 after the development the conductivity of the conductive metal portion can be increased while maintaining the high transmittance of the light transmitting portion. For example the tone of 4.0 or more can be obtained by doping with rhodium or iridium ion.

The conductive sheet is obtained by the above steps. The surface resistance of the conductive sheet is preferably 0.1 to 100 ohm sq more preferably 1 to 10 ohm sq. The conductive sheet may be subjected to a calender treatment after the development treatment to obtain a desired surface resistance.

In this embodiment to increase the conductivity of the metallic silver portion formed by the above exposure and development treatments conductive metal particles may be deposited thereon by a physical development treatment and or a plating treatment. In the present invention the conductive metal particles may be deposited on the metallic silver portion by only one of the physical development and plating treatments or by the combination of the treatments. The metallic silver portion subjected to the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment in this manner is also referred to as the conductive metal portion.

In this embodiment the physical development is such a process that metal ions such as silver ions are reduced by a reducing agent whereby metal particles are deposited on a metal or metal compound core. Such physical development has been used in the fields of instant B W film instant slide film printing plate production etc. and the technologies can be used in the present invention. The physical development may be carried out at the same time as the above development treatment after the exposure and may be carried out after the development treatment separately.

In this embodiment the plating treatment may contain electroless plating such as chemical reduction plating or displacement plating electrolytic plating or a combination thereof. Known electroless plating technologies for printed circuit boards etc. may be used in this embodiment. The electroless plating is preferably electroless copper plating.

In this embodiment the metallic silver portion formed by the development treatment or the conductive metal portion formed by the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment is preferably subjected to an oxidation treatment. For example by the oxidation treatment a small amount of a metal deposited on the light transmitting portion can be removed so that the transmittance of the light transmitting portion can be increased to approximately 100 .

In this embodiment the lower limit of the line widths of the conductive metal portions the first conductive part A and the second conductive part B is preferably 1 3 4 or 5 m and the upper limit thereof is preferably 15 10 9 or 8 m. When the line width is less than the lower limit the conductive metal portion has an insufficient conductivity whereby a touch panel using the conductive part has an insufficient detection sensitivity. On the other hand when the line width is more than the upper limit moire is significantly generated due to the conductive metal portion and a touch panel using the conductive part has a poor visibility. When the line width is within the above range moire of the conductive metal portion is improved and the visibility is remarkably improved. The line distance the distance between sides facing each other in the small lattice is preferably 30 to 500 m more preferably 50 to 400 m most preferably 100 to 350 m. The conductive metal portion may have a part with a line width of more than 200 m for the purpose of ground connection etc.

In this embodiment the opening ratio transmitting ratio of the conductive metal portion is preferably 85 or more more preferably 90 or more most preferably 95 or more in view of the visible light transmittance. The opening ratio is the ratio of the light transmitting portions other than the conductive portions including the first large lattices A the first connections A the second large lattices B the second connections B and the small lattices to the whole. For example a square lattice having a line width of 15 m and a pitch of 300 m has an opening ratio of 90 .

In this embodiment the light transmitting portion is a portion having light transmittance other than the conductive metal portions in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The transmittance of the light transmitting portion which is herein a minimum transmittance value in a wavelength region of 380 to 780 nm obtained neglecting the light absorption and reflection of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B is 90 or more preferably 95 or more more preferably 97 or more further preferably 98 or more most preferably 99 or more.

The exposure is preferably carried out using a glass mask method or a laser lithography exposure method.

In the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment the thicknesses of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably 5 to 350 m more preferably 30 to 150 m. When the thicknesses are 5 to 350 m a desired visible light transmittance can be obtained and the substrates can be easily handled.

The thickness of the metallic silver portion formed on the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B may be appropriately selected by controlling the thickness of the coating liquid for the silver salt containing layer applied to the substrate. The thickness of the metallic silver portion may be selected within a range of 0.001 to 0.2 mm and is preferably 30 m or less more preferably 20 m or less further preferably 0.01 to 9 m most preferably 0.05 to 5 m. The metallic silver portion is preferably formed in a patterned shape. The metallic silver portion may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers. In a case where the metallic silver portion has a patterned multilayer structure containing two or more layers the layers may have different wavelength color sensitivities. In this case different patterns can be formed in the layers by using exposure lights with different wavelengths.

In the case of using the first conductive sheet A or the second conductive sheet B in a touch panel the conductive metal portion preferably has a smaller thickness. As the thickness is reduced the viewing angle and visibility of the display panel are improved. Thus the thickness of the layer of the conductive metal on the conductive metal portion is preferably less than 9 m more preferably 0.1 m or more but less than 5 m further preferably 0.1 m or more but less than 3 m.

In this embodiment the thickness of the metallic silver portion can be controlled by changing the coating thickness of the silver salt containing layer and the thickness of the conductive metal particle layer can be controlled in the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment whereby the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B having a thickness of less than 5 m preferably less than 3 m can be easily produced.

The plating or the like is not necessarily carried out in the method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment. This is because the desired surface resistance can be obtained by controlling the applied silver amount and the silver binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer in the method. The calender treatment or the like may be carried out if necessary.

It is preferred that after the silver salt emulsion layer is developed the resultant is immersed in a hardener and thus subjected to a film hardening treatment. Examples of the hardeners include boric acid 2 3 dihydroxy 1 4 dioxane and dialdehydes such as glutaraldehyde and adipaldehyde described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2 141279.

An additional functional layer such as an antireflection layer or a hard coat layer may be formed in the laminated conductive sheet.

The present invention may be appropriately combined with technologies described in the following patent publications and international patent pamphlets shown in Tables 1 and 2. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. Pamphlet No. and the like are omitted.

The present invention will be described more specifically below with reference to Examples. Materials amounts ratios treatment contents treatment procedures and the like used in Examples may be appropriately changed without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following specific Examples are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.

Conductive sheets of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 and Examples 1 to 6 mere subjected to surface resistance and transmittance measurement and moire and visibility evaluation. The components measurement results and evaluation results of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 and Examples 1 to 6 are shown in Table 3.

An emulsion containing an aqueous medium a gelatin and silver iodobromochloride particles was prepared. The amount of the gelatin was 10.0 g per 150 g of Ag and the silver iodobromochloride particles had an I content of 0.2 mol a Br content of 40 mol and an average spherical equivalent diameter of 0.1 m.

KRhBrand KIrCl mere added to the emulsion at a concentration of 10mol mol silver to dope the silver bromide particles with Rh and Ir ions. NaPdClwas further added to the emulsion and the resultant emulsion was subjected to gold sulfur sensitization using chlorauric acid and sodium thiosulfate. The emulsion and a gelatin hardening agent were applied to each of a first transparent substrate A and a second transparent substrate B both composed of a polyethylene terephthalate PET such that the amount of the applied silver was 10 g m. The Ag gelatin volume ratio was 2 1.

The PET support had a width of 30 cm and the emulsion was applied thereto into a width of 25 cm and a length of 20 m. The both end portions having a width of 3 cm of the PET support were cut off to obtain a roll photosensitive silver halide material having a width of 24 cm.

An A4 210 mm 297 mm sized area of the first transparent substrate A was exposed in the pattern of the first conductive sheet A shown in and an A4 sized area of the second transparent substrate B was exposed in the pattern of the second conductive sheet B shown in . The exposure was carried out using a parallel light from a light source of a high pressure mercury lamp and patterned photomasks.

The exposed photosensitive materials were treated with the above treatment agents under the following conditions using an automatic processor FG 710PTS manufactured by FUJIFILM Corporation. A development treatment was carried out at 35 C. for 30 seconds a fixation treatment was carried out at 34 C. for 23 seconds and then a water washing treatment was carried out for 20 seconds at a water flow rate of 5 L min.

In the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B produced in example 1 the conductive portions the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive pattern B had a line width of 1 m the small lattices had a side length of 50 m and the large lattices the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B had a side length of 3 mm.

The first and second conductive sheets of example 2 were produced in the same manner as example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 5 m and the small lattices had a side length of 50 m.

The first and second conductive sheets of example 3 were produced in the same manner as example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 9 m the small lattices had a side length of 150 m and the large lattices had a side length of 5 mm.

The first and second conductive sheets of example 4 were produced in the same manner as example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 10 m the small lattices had a side length of 300 m and the large lattices had a side length of 6 mm.

The first and second conductive sheets of example 5 were produced in the same manner as example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 15 m the small lattices had a side length of 400 m and the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm.

The first and second conductive sheets of example 6 were produced in the same manner as example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 20 m the small lattices had a side length of 500 m and the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm.

The first and second conductive sheets of Comparative example 1 mere produced in the same manner as example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 0.5 m the small lattices had a side length of 40 m and the large lattices had a side length of 3 mm.

The first and second conductive sheets of Comparative example 2 mere produced in the same manner as in Comparative example 1 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 25 m the small lattices had a side length of 500 m and the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm.

In each of the first conductive sheets A and the second conductive sheets B the surface resistivity values of optionally selected 10 areas were measured by LORESTA GP Model No. MCP T610 manufactured by Dia Instruments Co. Ltd. utilizing an in line four probe method ASP and the average of the measured values was obtained to evaluate the detection accuracy.

The transmittance of each of the first conductive sheets A and the second conductive sheets B was measured by a spectrophotometer to evaluate the transparency.

In each of Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 the first conductive sheet A was stacked on the second conductive sheet B to obtain a laminated conductive sheet. The laminated conductive sheet was attached to a display screen of a liquid crystal display device to obtain a touch panel. The touch panel was fixed to a turntable and the liquid crystal display device was operated to display a white color. The moire of the laminated conductive sheet was visually observed and evaluated while turning the turntable within a bias angle range of 45 to 45 .

The moire was observed at a distance of 1.5 m from the display screen of the liquid crystal display device. The laminated conductive sheet was evaluated as Excellent when the moire was not visible as Fair when the moire was slightly visible to an acceptable extent or as Poor when the moire was highly visible.

When the touch panel was fixed to the turntable and the liquid crystal display device was operated to display the white color before the moire evaluation whether a thickened line or a black point was formed or not on the touch panel and whether a boundary between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B in the touch panel was visible or not were observed by the naked eye.

As shown in Table 3 though the conductive sheets of Comparative example 1 had excellent results in the moire and visibility evaluation they had a surface resistance of 1 kohm sq or more. Thus the conductive sheets of Comparative example 1 may exhibit a low conductivity and an insufficient detection sensitivity. Though the conductive sheets of Comparative example 2 had excellent conductivity and transmittance the moire was highly visible and the conductive portions per se were highly visible to the naked eye to deteriorate the visibility.

In contrast among Examples 1 to 6 the conductive sheets of Examples 1 to 5 mere excellent in the conductivity transmittance moire and visibility. The conductive sheets of example 6 mere inferior to those of Examples 1 to 5 in the moire and visibility evaluation but the moire was only slightly visible to an acceptable extent the image quality of the display device was not deteriorated.

Laminated conductive sheets of Examples 11 to 25 mere subjected to visibility evaluation. The components and evaluation results of Examples 11 to 25 are shown in Table 4.

The first conductive sheet A was stacked on the second conductive sheet B as described in First example to obtain the laminated conductive sheet of Example 11. In Example 11 as shown in Table 4 the conductive portions the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B had a line width of 5 m the small lattices had a side length of 50 m and the large lattices the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B had a side length of 3 mm as in example 2 of First example . In example 11 the shift length in the third and fourth direction hereinafter referred to as the shift length was 2.5 m.

The laminated conductive sheets of Examples 12 and 13 were produced in the same manner as in Example 11 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 8 m the small lattices had a side length of 150 m the large lattices had a side length of 5 mm and the shift lengths were 25 and 75 m respectively.

The laminated conductive sheets of Examples 14 15 and 16 mere produced in the same manner as in Example 11 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 8 m the small lattices had a side length of 250 m the large lattices had a side length of 5 mm and the shift lengths were 25 75 and 125 m respectively.

The laminated conductive sheets of Examples 17 18 19 and 20 mere produced in the same manner as in Example 11 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 10 m the small lattices had a side length of 300 m the large lattices had a side length of 6 mm and the shift lengths were 25 75 125 and 150 m respectively.

The laminated conductive sheets of Examples 21 22 23 24 and 25 mere produced in the same manner as in Example 11 except that the conductive portions had a line width of 15 m the small lattices had a side length of 500 m the large lattices had a side length of 10 mm and the shift lengths were 25 75 125 150 and 250 m respectively.

In each of Examples 11 to 25 the laminated conductive sheet was attached to a display screen of a liquid crystal display device to obtain a touch panel. When the liquid crystal display device was operated to display a white color whether a thickened line or a black point was formed or not on the touch panel and whether a boundary between the first large lattice A and the second large lattice B in the touch panel was visible or not were observed by the naked eye.

As shown in Table 4 all the laminated conductive sheets of Examples 11 to 25 had excellent results in the visibility evaluation. Thus the shift length was at most of the side length of the small lattices so that the straight lines on the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B did not overlap with each other and the visibility was not deteriorated. In addition laminated conductive sheets produced by exposing the first conductive sheet A in the pattern shown in and by exposing the second conductive sheet B in the pattern shown in exhibited the same results.

Laminated conductive sheets of Examples 31 to 45 mere subjected to visibility evaluation. The components and evaluation results of Examples 31 to 45 are shown in Table 5.

The laminated conductive sheets of Examples 31 to 45 were produced in the same manner as Examples 11 to 25 except that the first conductive sheet A was exposed in the pattern shown in and the second conductive sheet B was exposed in the pattern shown in respectively.

All the laminated conductive sheets of Examples 31 to 45 had excellent results in the visibility evaluation. Particularly in Examples 31 to 45 the first auxiliary line and the second auxiliary line mere crossed to form a pattern like the small lattices so that the visibility was not deteriorated. Furthermore the shift length was at most of the side length of the small lattices so that the straight lines on the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B did not overlap with each other and the visibility was not deteriorated. In addition laminated conductive sheets produced by exposing the first conductive sheet A in the pattern shown in and by exposing the second conductive sheet B in the pattern shown in exhibited the same results.

Each of the laminated conductive sheets of Examples 1 to 6 Examples 11 to 25 and Examples 31 to 45 was used to produce a projected capacitive touch panel. When the touch panel was operated by a finger touch the touch panel exhibited a high response speed and an excellent detection sensitivity. Furthermore when two or more points were touched the touch panel exhibited the same excellent properties. Thus it was confirmed that the touch panel was capable of multi touch detection.

It is to be understood that the conductive sheet the conductive sheet using method and the touch panel of the present invention are not limited to the above embodiments and various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention.
