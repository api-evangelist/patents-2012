title: Execution allocation cost assessment for computing systems and environments including elastic computing systems and environments
abstract: Techniques for assessing the cost of allocation of execution and affecting the allocation of execution are disclosed. The cost of allocation of execution between a first computing device (e.g., mobile device) and one or more computing resource providers (e.g., Clouds) can be determined during runtime of the code. A computing system can operate independently of the first computing device and a computing resource provider and provide execution allocation cost assessment. Execution allocation cost can be assessed based on execution allocation data pertaining to the first computing device and computing resource providers. Power consumption of a mobile device can be used as a factor in determining how to allocate individual components of an application program between a mobile phone and a Cloud. In an Elastic computing environment, external computing resources can be used to extend the computing capabilities beyond that which can be provided by internal computing resources.

Conceptually a computing system e.g. a computing device a personal computer a laptop a Smartphone a mobile phone can accept information content or data and manipulate it to obtain or determine a result based on a sequence of instructions or a computer program that effectively describes how to process the information. Typically the information is stored in a computer readable medium in a binary form. More complex computing systems can store content including the computer program itself. A computer program may be invariable and or built into for example a computer or computing device as logic circuitry provided on microprocessors or computer chips. Today general purpose computers can have both kinds of programming. A computing system can also have a support system which among other things manages various resources e.g. memory peripheral devices and services e.g. basic functions such as opening files and allows the resources to be shared among multiple programs. One such support system is generally known as an Operating System OS which provides programmers with an interface used to access these resources and services.

Today numerous types of computing devices are available. These computing devices widely range with respect to size cost amount of storage and processing power. The computing devices that are available today include expensive and powerful servers relatively cheaper Personal Computers PC s and laptops and yet less expensive microprocessors or computer chips provided in storage devices automobiles and household electronic appliances.

In recent years computing systems have become more portable and mobile. As a result various mobile and handheld devices have been made available. By way of example wireless phones media players Personal Digital Assistants PDA s are widely used today. Generally a mobile or a handheld device also known as handheld computer or simply handheld can be a pocket sized computing device typically utilizing a small visual display screen for user output and a miniaturized keyboard for user input. In the case of a Personal Digital Assistant PDA the input and output can be combined into a touch screen interface.

In particular mobile communication devices e.g. mobile phones have become extremely popular. Some mobile communication devices e.g. Smartphones offer computing environments that are similar to that provided by a Personal Computer PC . As such a Smartphone can effectively provide a complete operating system as a standardized interface and platform for application developers.

Another more recent trend is the ever increasing accessibility of the Internet and the services that can be provided via the Internet. Today the Internet can be accessed virtually anywhere by using various computing devices. For example mobile phones smart phones datacards handheld game consoles cellular routers and numerous other devices can allow users to connect to the Internet from anywhere in a cellular network. Within the limitations imposed by the small screen and other limited and or reduced facilities of a pocket sized or handheld device the services of the Internet including email and web browsing may be available. Typically users manage information with web browsers but other software can allow them to interface with computer networks that are connected to or by the Internet. These other programs include for example electronic mail online chat file transfer and file sharing. Today s Internet can be viewed as a vast global network of interconnected computers enabling users to share information along multiple channels. Typically a computer that connects to the Internet can access information from a vast array of available servers and other computers by moving information from them to the computer s local memory. The Internet is a very useful and important resource as readily evidenced by its ever increasing popularity and widening usage and applications.

The popularity of computing systems is evidenced by their ever increasing use in everyday life. Accordingly techniques that can improve computing systems would be very useful.

Broadly speaking the invention relates to computing systems and computing environments. More particularly the invention pertains to techniques for assessment of the cost of allocation of executable computer code in computing environment including Elastic computing environments where among other things computing capabilities of a computing system e.g. a computing device can be effectively extended in a dynamic manner at runtime.

A computing system can be operable to determine the cost of allocation of execution to or between at least a first computing device e.g. a mobile device and one or more computing resource providers e.g. one or more Clouds during runtime of the executable code. It will be appreciated that the computing system can operate independently of the first computing device and one or more computing resource providers and provide execution allocation cost assessment as a service to the first computing device and or one or more computing resource providers. Execution allocation cost can be assessed or determined based on execution allocation data pertaining to the first computing device and or one or more computing resource providers. By way of example power consumption of a mobile device can be used as a factor in determining how to allocate individual components of an application program e.g. weblets between a mobile phone and a Cloud.

The invention is especially suited for Elastic computing environment and systems. In an Elastic computing environment scalable and dynamic external computing resources can be used in order to effectively extend the computing capabilities beyond that which can be provided by internal computing resources of a computing system or environment. A scalable and dynamic external computing resource can provide computing resources that far exceed the internal computing resources of a computing system and or environment e.g. a computing device . As a result a computing system may function with relatively limited and or reduced computing resources e.g. processing power memory but have the ability to effectively provide as much computing services as may be needed and provide the services when needed on demand and dynamically during the execution time.

In an Elastic computing environment an Elastic computing system e.g. a computing device can be operable to determine during runtime of executable computer code whether to execute or continue to execute one or more portions of the executable computer code by effectively using a dynamically scalable computing resource as an external computing resource. The computing system can determine the relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code between internal computing resources and the external computing resources of the dynamically scalable computing resource in a dynamic manner at runtime e.g. during load time after load time before execution time execution time and allocate the execution accordingly.

In addition an Elastic computing device can be operable to effectively use a scalable and dynamically scalable resource for execution of at least a first part or portion of executable computer code. The computing device may also be operable to use its internal computing resources to execute a second part or portion of executable computer code. Nevertheless the computing device can provide the output of the executions of both the first and second parts of the executable computer code result thereby making the collective result of the execution available on the computing system. It should be noted that the computing device can be operable to use a dynamically scalable resource as an abstract resource. By way of example an Abstract and Dynamically Scalable Computing Resource ADSCR can be accessed using an abstract interface. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the ADSCR can for example be a Cloud computing resource operable to deliver dynamically scalable computing resources via an abstract interface as Web services over the Internet.

The invention can be implemented in numerous ways including for example a method an apparatus a computer readable and or storable medium and a computing system e.g. a computing device . A computer readable medium can for example include and or store at least executable computer program code stored in a tangible form. Several embodiments of the invention are discussed below.

Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.

As noted in the background section computing environments and systems are very useful. Today various computing devices have become integrated in every day life. In particular portable computing devices are extremely popular. As such extensive efforts have been made to provide cheaper and more powerful portable computing devices. In addition it is highly desirable to provide modern Consumer Electronic CE devices with extensive computing capabilities. However conventional computing environments and techniques are not generally suitable for providing modern portable and CE computing devices. In other words conventional computing environments provided for more traditional computing devices e.g. Personal Computers servers can be relatively complex and or expensive and not generally suitable for modern CE computing devices especially for a CE device intended to operate with limited and or reduced resources e.g. processing power memory battery power and or provide other functionalities for example mobile phones. In some cases the computing capabilities of a CE device would serve as a secondary functionality e.g. televisions refrigerators etc. . As such it is not very desirable to use a relatively complex and expensive computing environment in order to provide modern CE devices with extensive computing capabilities.

In view of the foregoing improved computing environments are needed. It will be appreciated that the invention provides improved computing environments and computing techniques.

The invention relates to computing systems and computing environments. More particularly the invention pertains to techniques for assessment of the cost of allocation of executable computer code in computing environment including Elastic computing environments where among other things computing capabilities of a computing system e.g. a computing device can be effectively extended in a dynamic manner at runtime.

A computing system can be operable to determine the cost of allocation of execution to or between at least a first computing device e.g. a mobile device and one or more computing resource providers e.g. one or more Clouds during runtime of the executable code. It will be appreciated that the computing system can operate independently of the first computing device and one or more computing resource providers and provide execution allocation cost assessment as a service to the first computing device and or one or more computing resource providers. Execution allocation cost can be assessed or determined based on execution allocation data pertaining to the first computing device and or one or more computing resource providers. By way of example power consumption of a mobile device can be used as a factor in determining how to allocate individual components of an application program e.g. weblets between a mobile phone and a Cloud.

The invention is especially suited for Elastic computing environment and systems. In an Elastic computing environment scalable and dynamic external computing resources can be used in order to effectively extend the computing capabilities beyond that which can be provided by internal computing resources of a computing system or environment. A scalable and dynamic external computing resource can provide computing resources that far exceed the internal computing resources of a computing system and or environment e.g. a computing device . As a result a computing system may function with relatively limited and or reduced computing resources e.g. processing power memory but have the ability to effectively provide as much computing services as may be needed and provide the services when needed on demand and dynamically during the execution time.

In an Elastic computing environment an Elastic computing system e.g. a computing device can be operable to determine during runtime of executable computer code whether to execute or continue to execute one or more portions of the executable computer code by effectively using a dynamically scalable computing resource as an external computing resource. The computing system can determine the relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code between internal computing resources and the external computing resources of the dynamically scalable computing resource in a dynamic manner at runtime e.g. during load time after load time before execution time execution time and allocate the execution accordingly.

In addition an Elastic computing device can be operable to effectively use a scalable and dynamically scalable resource for execution of at least a first part or portion of executable computer code. The computing device may also be operable to use its internal computing resources to execute a second part or portion of executable computer code. Nevertheless the computing device can provide the output of the executions of both the first and second parts of the executable computer code result thereby making the collective result of the execution available on the computing system. It should be noted that the computing device can be operable to use a dynamically scalable resource as an abstract resource. By way of example an Abstract and Dynamically Scalable Computing Resource ADSCR can be accessed using an abstract interface. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the ADSCR can for example be a Cloud computing resource operable to deliver dynamically scalable computing resources via an abstract interface as Web services over the Internet.

Embodiments of these aspects of the invention are discussed below with reference to . However those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.

Moreover it will be appreciated that the computing device can be operable to effectively facilitate and or cause execution of the executable computer code by a Dynamically Scalable Computing Resource DSCR that can provide scalable computing resources on demand and as need by the computing device in a dynamic manner. As such the computing device can be operable to use the internal computing resources as well as one or more external computing resources external computing resources of the DSCR . In other words the computing device can be operable to effectively use both internal computing resources and external computing resources in order to effectively facilitate initiate resume and or cause execution of various portions or parts of the executable computer code e.g. a first and second portions A and B can be executed using respectively internal and external computing resources and .

More particularly the computing device can effectively provide an Elastic Computing System ESC operable to effectively extend the internal computing resources by utilizing or effectively using the external computing resources of the DSCR . It should be noted that DSCR can effectively provide a layer of abstraction so that the ESC need not specifically address a specific computing resource e.g. a computing resource R of a computing device of Machine M or know the identity of a specific machine or device M that executes the second portion B of the executable computer code on behalf of the computing device . As such the DSCR can be provided as an ADSCR as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. As a result the ESC can be operable to effectively use the computing resources of various entities including for example Machine M and Machine M of the ADSCR by addressing an interface whereby the computing resources and or services provided by them can be effectively abstracted from the computing device .

It will also be appreciated that the ESC can be operable to determine during the runtime of the executable computer code whether to execute or continue to execute one or more portions of the executable computer code by effectively using the DSCR thereby dynamically determining during runtime relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code between the internal computing resources of the computing system and external computing resources of the DSCR . Based on this determination of relative extent of allocation of execution the ESC can also be operable to effectively use the one or more external resources of the DSCR for execution of one or more portions of the executable computer code . In other words the ESC can cause the execution of one or more portions of the executable computer code when it determines to execute one or more portions of the executable computer code by effectively using one or more of the external resources of the DSCR .

It should be noted that the determination of the relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code can for example occur when one or more portions of the executable computer code is to be loaded for execution one or more portions said executable computer code is to be executed one or more portions of the executable computer code is being executed by one or more of the internal computing resources one or more portions the executable computer code is being executed by the external computing resources . Generally this determination can be made during runtime when executable computer code is to be loaded for execution or is to be executed e.g. after it has been loaded but before execution or is being executed.

It should also be noted that determination of the relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code can be performed by the ESC without requiring user input thereby automatically determining the relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code between said one or more internal computing resources and one or more external resources . However it should be noted that the ESC may be operable to make this determination based on one or more preferences that can for example be provided as set of predetermined user defined preferences e.g. minimize power or battery usage use internal resources first maximize performance minimize monetary cost . The ESC may also be operable to make the determination of the relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code based on input explicitly provided by a user at runtime. By way of example the ESC may be operable to request user input and or user confirmation prior to allocation of execution to the DSCR .

This determination can for example be made based on one or more capabilities the internal computing resources monetary cost associated with using the external resources expected and or expectable latency for delivering services by the external resources network bandwidth for communication with the DSCR status of one or more physical resources battery power of the computing system one or more environmental factors physical location of the computing system number and or types of applications being executed on the computing system type of applications to be executed.

It will be appreciated that the ESC can be operable to determine the relative extent of allocation of execution of the executable computer code between the internal and external computing resources and without requiring code developers to explicitly define the extent of the allocation. In other words the ESC can determine the extent of execution allocation to external computing resources and make the allocation accordingly without requiring the executable computer code to effectively provide any instructions with respect to allocation of execution between the internal and external computing resources and . As a result computer application developers need not develop applications that explicitly define allocation between internal and external computing resources of a computing system or a device. It should be noted that the developer can explicitly identify code portions or code fragments to be allocated for execution using internal and external computing resources. However the ESC can determine which of the code portions are to be executed by internal or external computing resources.

It will also be appreciated that the ESC can be operable to effectively increase and or decrease the extent of the effective use of the one or more external resources of the DSCR during runtime of the executable computer code thereby effectively providing dynamic elasticity to modify and or adjust the extent of allocation of execution to execute more of less portions of the executable computer code during runtime. The one or more portions of the executable computer code can be relocate and or replicable code as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Moreover the ESC can be operable to effectively relocate one or more re locatable and or replicable code portions from the computing system to the DSCR or vice versa during runtime of the executable computer code .

In other words the computing device can be operable to vary the extent of execution allocation of the executable computer code during run time between various allocation stages. These allocation stages include i an internal allocation stage when the executable computer code is executed entirely and or using only the internal computing resources ii a split allocation stage when the executable computer code is executed using both internal and external computing resources and and iii an external allocation stage when the executable computer code is executed entirely and or using only the external computing resources . As such the computing device can be operable to vary the extent of execution allocation of the executable computer code during run time to provide vertical elasticity between the internal computing resources and the external computing resources of the DSCR such that executable computer code is executed using only the internal computing resources or is split between the internal and external computing resources and so that at least a first executable portion A is executed using internal computing resources and at least a second executable portion B is executed using the external computing resources .

In addition it should be noted that the ESC can be operable to cause execution of at least two portions of said executable code respectively on two nodes e.g. machines M and M of the DSCR . By way of example the ESC can be operable to cause execution of at least two processes associated with the executable computer code respectively on two separate computing nodes of the executable computer code .

In view of the foregoing it will be apparent the ESC allows the computing device to effectively extend its computing capabilities beyond its internal computing capabilities effectively defined based on the capabilities of the internal computing resources . As such the computing device need not be bound by the limits of its internal computing capabilities but may be bound by the limits of the external computing resources of the DSCR which may be relatively and or virtually unlimited with respect to the internal computing resources . As a result the computing device may be provided with very limited reduced and or cheap internal resources but be operable to effectively provide computing capabilities that are bound only by the virtually limitless external resources of dynamically saleable resources e.g. a Cloud Computing Resources capable of providing virtually as much computing capabilities as may be desired by a single computing device .

It will also be appreciated that the ESC can be operable to cause execution of the one or more portions of the executable computer code by one or more external resources without copying any operating environment e.g. an operating system an image of the computing device which is operable to execute the one or more portions of the executable computer code on the computing device .

The ESC can be operable to obtain e.g. generate receive a first output data as a result of the execution of the first executable computer code portion A by the internal computing resources . In addition the ESC can be operable to obtain second output data as a result of the execution of the second portion B of the executable computer code . This means that the first and second output data associated respectively with the execution of the first and second portions A and B can both be made available as a collective result of the executable computer code . As a result the computing device can provide execution output e.g. computing services in a similar manner as would be provided had the execution been performed using only the internal computing resources . It should be noted that the ESC can be operable to effectively facilitate initiate resume and or cause execution of one or more portions of the executable computer code by using one or more external computing resources of the DSCR or by facilitating initiating resuming and or causing the execution by the DSCR i.e. causing the DSCR to execute the executable computer code using its computing resources . An external computing resource e.g. R and R may for example provide both the processing power and memory needed to execute one or more portions of the executable computer code or support the execution by providing only memory or only processing power required for execution.

In general the ESC can be operable to effectively request computing services from the DSCR . As a dynamically scalable resource provider the DSCR can provide computing resources on demand and to the extent needed during execution time so that it can execute at least both first and second portions A and B of the executable computer code . It will be appreciated that the computing resources of the DSCR can far exceed the internal computing resources of the computing device . By way of example the computing device can be a computing device with relatively limited and or reduced computing resources in comparison to a Cloud computing resource that can provide scalable computing resources including processing power and memory dynamically and on demand to the extent requested by the ESC of the computing device .

A Cloud computing resource is an example of a dynamically scalable computing resource capable of providing computing services over the Internet and using typically virtualized computing resources as will be readily known to those skilled in the art. Generally using a dynamically scalable external resource the ESC can effectively provide a virtual device with computing capabilities far exceeding its relatively limited and or reduced internal computing resources .

It should also be noted that the ESC can effectively use the dynamic scalability of the DSCR in order to provide a dynamically adaptable device capable of effectively providing computing services on the demand and as needed. As such the ESC can be operable to effectively switch between internal computing resources and external computing resources at run time during the execution of the executable computer code . By way of example the ESC can be operable to cause execution of a third portion C of the executable computer code by the DSCR after initiating or causing execution of the first or second portions A and B of the executable computer code and possibly while the first and or second portions A and B of the executable computer code are being executed. As another example the ESC can be operable to execute or resume execution of the second portion B of the executable computer code using the internal computing resources after effectively initiating or causing execution of the second portion B of the executable computer code on the DSCR . As yet another example the ESC can be operable to effectively facilitate cause or resume execution of a first portion A by the DSCR after initiating the execution of the first portion A and while it is still being executed on the internal computing resource .

Generally the ESC can be operable to determine whether to execute at least a portion of the executable computer code using an external computing resource such as the external computing resources provided by the DSCR . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this determination can be made based on various factors including for example one or more of the following capabilities of the internal computing resources the monetary cost associated with external resources expected and or expectable latency for delivering services network bandwidth status of physical resources e.g. current battery power environmental factors e.g. location .

The ESC can also be operable to coordinate the internal and external execution activities. By way of example the ESC can be operable to effectively coordinate execution of a first executable code portion A using internal computing resources with the execution of a second executable code portion B using DSCR thereby effectively using both internal and external computing resources to execute said executable computer code in a coordinated manner. As part of the coordination activities the ESC can be operable to obtain first and second output data respectively for the first and second executable code portions as a collective result thereby making available on the ESC both the first and second output data as a collective result of execution of the executable computer program code . It will be appreciated that the ESC can provide the collective result as if the entire executable code has been executed using internal computing resources . A user of the ESC need not be aware that external computing resources are being used and computing service can be delivered in a meaningful way. In addition ESC allows development and execution of the same executable computer code e.g. a computer Application Program for various devices ranging from those that may have very limited and or reduced computing resources to those with very extensive computing resources thereby enhancing the software development process and maintenance.

In view of the foregoing it will readily be appreciated that the computing device can for example be a Consumer Electronic CE device a mobile device a handheld device a home appliance device a Television a refrigerator with relatively limited and or reduced built in computing resources. Moreover it will be appreciated that ESC is especially suitable for CE and or mobile devices with general characteristics that include limited and or reduced computing resources and or power varying communication speed quality and or responsiveness to the user.

Referring to initially it is determined whether to execute executable computer code. In effect the method can wait until it is determined that executable computer code is to be executed. If it is determined to execute executable computer code the method can proceed to determine whether to use external computing resources and or the extent of respective use of internal and external computing resources in order to execute the executable computer code. As a result execution of at least a portion of the executable computer code can be initiated B using one or more internal computing resources of the computing device or a particular computing environment or computing system . In addition execution of at least a portion of the executable computer code can be initiated facilitated and or caused B using a DSCR. In other words one or more computing resources of a DSCR can be effectively requested to be provided to the computing device as one or more external resources. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that generally execution A and B can be initiated using internal and external computing resources A and B substantially in parallel or virtually at the same time. Furthermore it will be appreciated that execution of various portions of the executable computer code can effectively switch between internal and external computing resources. Referring back to it can optionally be determined whether to switch execution of one or more portions of executable computer code from an external computing resource namely a DSCR to one or more internal computing resources. As a result execution of a portion of the executable computer code can be initiated using an external computing resource but later moved and or resumed using an internal computing resource. Similarly it can optionally be determined whether to switch execution of one or more portions of the executable computer code from one or more internal computing resources to one or more external computing resources and the usage of computing resources can be changed accordingly.

It should be noted that execution of executable computer code using respectively internal and external computing resources can end if it is determined to end A execution using internal computing resources or end B execution using external computing resources. The method can proceed in a similar manner to execute executable computer code using internal and or external computing resources while allowing usage of these resources to be adjusted during execution time in a dynamic manner as depicted in .

Referring back two exemplary operations that can be coordinated are depicted. A first operation is depicted as initiating A execution of at least a first portion of executable computer code by or using one or more internal computing resources of a computing device. A second operation is depicted as effectively using B external computing resources of a least one DSCR for execution of a second portion of the executable code. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that these exemplary operations A and B can be initiated in various orders or in parallel.

As a part of this coordination the coordination can determine when to initiate each of the exemplary operations A and B and initiate them accordingly. In effect the coordination can continue to effectively coordinate a execution of the first portion of executable computer code using internal computing resources with b execution of the second portion of executable computer code using external computing resources of a DSCR.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the coordination can for example include generating a first output for execution of the first portion of the executable computer code by using internal computing resources and obtaining a second execution result as a result of execution of the second portion of the executable computer code by one or more external computing resources. Referring back to as a part of the coordination it can be determined whether the results of the executions A and B are available. Accordingly a collective result of the execution of the first and second portions of the code can be generated as a part of the coordination . It should be noted that the collective result may be presented by the computing device and or made available by the computing system.

However if it is determined that the results of the executions are not available it can be determined whether to adjust and or re coordinate the execution of the executable computer code. Accordingly the execution of the executable computer can be dynamically adjusted and or re coordinated . By way of example execution of the second code portion can be reinitiated using the same external computing resource it can be initiated using a different external computing resource or it can be switched to an internal resource. In addition error handling and or error recovery may also be performed.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that coordinating or re coordinating can for example also include determining when to effectively initiate execution of executable computer code using an internal or external computing resources selecting a DSCR from a set of DSCR s and selecting one or more external resources e.g. a specific type of resource a specific resource among other similar resources . Other examples include determining a location for sending a request for execution of executable computer code or a portion thereof sending to the determined location a request for the execution of the executable computer code and obtaining from the location the execution result.

In particular if it is determined to execute or continue to execute at least one portion of the executable computer code by effectively using a dynamically scalable computing resource the method proceeds to allocate execution between internal and external computing resources accordingly. After execution of the executable computer code has been allocated accordingly method proceeds to determine whether to execute one or more portions of executable computer code by effectively using a dynamically scalable computing resource. In effect the allocation of execution may be adjusted to allocate more or less of the execution of the executable computer code to the external resources. Method ends if it is determined to end execution of the executable computer code or if it is determined not to execute the executable computer code.

As noted above the Elastic Computing System ESC e.g. ESC shown in can effectively extend the internal or physical computing resources of a computing device thereby extending the internal computing capabilities of the computing device. As a result a virtual device with extensive computing capabilities can be effectively built using a device with relatively limited and or reduced capabilities. It should be noted that the internal computing capabilities of the computing device can be extended at runtime in a dynamic manner.

To further elaborate depicts a computing environment in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The computing environment can for example be provided by and or for the computing device depicted in .

Referring to an Elastic Layer component or module can be provided for a hardware layer . The Elastic Layer EL may interface with an optional top layer that can for example include a User Interface UI a Web Top WT layer or an application layer. As shown in an optional Operating System OS layer may also reside between the Elastic Layer EL and the hardware layer as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that a Virtual Environment VE e.g. a Run Time Environment RTE can be provided by the Elastic Layer EL to effectively extend the physical hardware layer and its capabilities. Referring to the Elastic Layer EL can be operable to effectively initiate and or instantiate one or more instances of a VE on demand and as needed. For example an individual RTE instance A can be initiated for execution of a particular part or portion of executable computer code e.g. an application component an Applet a Weblet . The Elastic Layer EL can be operable to effectively initiate or cause initiation of a virtual computing environment by the ADSCR .

In effect a computing resource A of the ADSCR can be provided by an RTE instance A as if the physical computing resource A is present in the hardware layer . The RTE allows effectively extending the resource A to the Computing Environment . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the RTE can for example be provided to a virtual computing environment on the ADSCR and or the computing environment . The Elastic Layer EL can initiate RTE instances as needed and consequently be provided with the computing resources of the ADSCR on demand and in a dynamic manner at runtime or during the execution of executable computer code . As a result the Elastic Layer EL can effectively provide a virtual computing device capable of providing computing capabilities that can be extended dynamically and on demand far beyond the real capabilities of the hardware layer .

As noted above a Cloud computing resource is an example of a dynamically scalable computing resource capable of providing computing services over the Internet using typically virtualized computing resources. It will be appreciated that the invention is especially suited for Web based or Web centric applications using Cloud computing technology.

To further elaborate depicts a computing device in a Web based environment in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention. Referring to a Web based application can include a manifest a User Interface UI and a plurality of other application components and as generally known in the art. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that as components of a Web based application components and can perform operations including for example responding to Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP requests communicating with a single client and having a lifecycle bound to that of the client executing locally or remotely. The components of a Web based application e.g. Web based application are referred to herein as Weblets e.g. Weblets and . The manifest can effectively provide a description of the web based application . As such the manifest can for example provide information including the number of Weblets format of Weblet requests etc. Each of the Weblets and can be a part of an application and effectively encapsulate date state and the operations that can change the date state. A Weblet can include executable code for example in the form of bytecodes that effectively expose an HTTP Interface to the User Interface as will be readily known to those skilled in the art.

Those skilled in the art will also know that the computing device can effectively provide a Web Top layer A or component effectively providing an environment for rendering and executing or running User Interface UI components such as the User Interface UI of the web based application . UI component can for example be a browser as generally known in the art.

Referring back to the computing device also includes an Elastic Layer EL B that may provide a number of components or sub components . In particular an Application Manager AM can be operable to initiate or cause initiation of one or more Virtual Computing Environments VCEs as one or more Internal Virtual Machines IVMs in the computing device and or as one or more External Virtual Machines EVM in a Cloud computing resource or a Cloud . Each one of the IVM and EVM can effectively support the execution of a Weblet of the Web based application . By way of example the IVM can effectively support the execution of the Weblet when or while the EVM effectively supports the execution of the Weblet . Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that these VCEs can for example be provided as an Application Virtual Machine such as a Java Virtual Machine JVM a Common Language Runtime CLR a Low Level Virtual Machine LLVM and others including those that an provide a complete operating system environment. The Application Manager AM can manage an application and or the execution of the application as a whole. As such the Application Manager AM can effectively serve as a higher level layer that communicates with a lower layer effectively provided by an Elasticity Manager EM component operable to manage the individual Weblets.

In addition the Application Manager AM component of the Elastic Layer EL B can be operable to determine whether to initiate a VCE internally as an IVM or cause initiation of a VCE externally as an EVM on the Cloud . In other words the Application Manager AM component can be operable to determine whether to execute a particular Weblet e.g. Weblet Weblet using the internal computing resources of the computing device or external computing resources of the Cloud which are dynamically scalable and can be provided on demand. The Application Manager AM can be operable to make this determination based on the information provided by an Elasticity Manager EM . Generally the Elasticity Manager EM can be operable to monitor the environment of the computing device including the computing environment of the computing device and provide monitoring data to the Application Manager AM . The Elasticity Manager EM component can for example monitor the environment e.g. computing environment of the computing device based on data provided by sensors . Based on the data provided by the sensor and or obtained from other sources it can be determined whether to use of more of less of the external resources of the Cloud . As such the Application Manager AM may effectively initiate more EVMs on the Cloud in order to for example move the execution of the Weblet to the Cloud and or additionally execute a third Weblet of the Web based application not shown on an EVM of the Cloud .

It should be noted that a switcher component can effectively connect the Weblets or execution of the Weblets and to the User Interface UI regardless of whether the execution is supported entirely by the internal computing resources of the computing device or the execution is supported at least partly by the external computing resources of the Cloud .

It should be noted that the Cloud may have a Cloud Management Service CMS M that effectively manages services provided to various clients of the Cloud including the computing device . More particularly Elasticity Manager EM can effectively interface with the CMS M in order to manage or co manage one or more EVMs provided by the Cloud on behalf of computing device . In other words the Elasticity Manager EM can also be operable to serve as an interface to the Cloud and manage and or co mange the computing environments of the Cloud that pertain to the computing device .

In addition the Cloud may include other components. As shown in Cloud can provide a Web Top Environment W operable to effectively render and execute the User Interface UI of the Web based application . Moreover the Elasticity Manager EM may effectively request that the Application Manager AM initiate the execution of the User Interface UI by the Cloud . As a result the User Interface UI may be effectively rendered and executed in the Web Top Environment W of the Cloud . In that case a Remote User Interface RUI can be operable to communicate with the User Interface UI being rendered and executed by the Cloud . The Remote User Interface RUI may for example communicate user input data to the Cloud and receive as output relatively simple instructions such as update display and so on. As such the Remote User Interface RUI may be provided as a thin client or a lightweight User Interface while the UI logic is essentially performed by the Cloud .

It should be noted that the computing device can include additional components. Referring to an application loader can be operable to load various components of the Web based application in a similar manner as a conventional application loader operates.

Moreover it should be noted that the computing device can be operable to dynamically adjust its usage of the external computing resources or services provided by the Cloud at runtime when one or more of the Web based application are being executed. As such the computing device can behave as a dynamically adjustable or Elastic device. To further demonstrate the dynamic adaptability or Elasticity of the computing device B C and D depict various configurations of a dynamically adjustable or Elastic computing device in accordance with a number of embodiments of the invention.

Referring to the computing device also shown in may initially execute both Weblets and and execute and render the UI using its own internal computing resources. However if the internal computing resources are needed for other tasks or other factors dictate preservation of the internal computing resources the computing device may use the services or the external computing resources of a Cloud as shown in . The factors that may dictate preservation of the internal computing resources can for example include the location of the computing device the battery power monetary cost associated with obtaining external computing services network bandwidth available for obtaining external computing services and so on. Referring now to execution of the Weblet can be supported by the Cloud instead of the computing device while Weblet and UI are still executed using the internal computing resources of the computing device . Those skilled in the art will readily appreciated that the execution of the Weblet can be effectively moved to the Cloud by for example requesting its execution from Cloud or effectively initiating its execution on Cloud . As a dynamically elastic device the computing device may still use more of the computing resources of the Cloud during execution or run time. As shown in Weblet and can both be executed by the Cloud while only the UI is executed using the internal computing resources of the computing device . Subsequently the execution of the UI can even be effectively moved to the Cloud as depicted in . By way of example the execution of the UI can be requested from Cloud or effectively initiated on Cloud in order to effectively move the execution of UI to Cloud .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that Cloud Computing CC can among other things deliver infrastructure as a service IaaS platform as a service PaaS and software as a service SaaS . As a result computing models for service providers and individual consumers that enable new IT business models such as for example resource on demand pay as you go and utility computing. In the case of consumer electronic CE devices applications are traditionally constrained by limited and or reduce resources such as for example low CPU frequency smaller memory low network bandwidth and battery powered computing environment. Cloud computing can be used to effectively remove the traditional constraints imposed on CE devices. Various elastic devices including CE devices can be augmented with cloud based functionality.

Furthermore the elastic manager can be operable to make decisions regarding migrating weblets during run time e.g. when weblets are being executed between the device and the cloud based in various criteria for example including changes in the computing environment of the device or changes in user preferences. It should be noted that the weblets of an application can be operable to communicate with each other during execution to exchange various information to for example synchronize the application state and exchange input output data. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art communication between the weblets of the same application can for example be accomplished by a Remote Procedure Call RPC mechanism or using RESTful web services. The elasticity service can organize cloud resources and delegates application requirements from various mobile devices including the mobile device . As a service provider the elasticity service may or may not be part of a cloud provider.

Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the mobile device can for example represent an example of a computing device depicted in and the Elastic Service can for example represent a Cloud Management Service also depicted in .

It will also be appreciated that the computing communication environment among other things allows development of applications elastic applications that can even better leverage cloud computing for mobile devices that have traditionally been resource constrained. The general concepts and benefits of elastic applications are disclosed in provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 222 855 entitled SECURING ELASTIC APPLICATIONS ON MOBILE DEVICES FOR CLOUD COMPUTING filed Jul. 2 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes and among other things provides an elastic framework architecture and elastic application model a security model for elastic applications and elastic computing communication environment.

In view of the foregoing it will also be appreciated that the techniques described above among other things allow splitting an application program into sub components e.g. weblets spilt between an elastic device and a Cloud computing resource . This approach dramatically differs from conventional approaches including those that primarily focus on providing resources e.g. Information Technology IT resources provided to them to enterprise IT infrastructures traditional client server model where computation can be initially and statically requested from a service provider e.g. a server whereby most if not all of the computation is done by the service provider. In stark contrast the invention allows computation to be done based on application components e.g. individual weblets and allows each application component to be executed by a different entity and in a different location. As such the invention allows an application model that need not distinguish between clients and servers but can distinguish between individual components of a single application. The invention also provides device or client based techniques and solutions that have not been addressed by conventional approaches which have been primarily focused on providing resources from the perspective of a resource or service provider. Again it should be noted that the techniques of the inventions are especially and highly suited for mobile devices that have been traditionally constrained by limited computing capabilities due to their limited and or reduced computing resources. Conventional techniques do not provide a practical and feasible solution allowing mobile devices to effectively split execution of applications between in a dynamic manner thereby allowing execution of an application to be split during runtime in a manner deemed more appropriate at a given time and yet split differently later but still during the runtime of the same application.

In view of the foregoing it will readily be appreciated that in an Elastic Computing Environment ECE various executable code components or modules e.g. a computer application program can be effectively split between a CE device and one or more computing resource providers e.g. a cloud providing one or more platforms and or services . For example some parts or components of a computer application program or application can be executed or run on a device while others parts or components can be executed on a Cloud. This would effectively extend the computing capabilities of the device and can overcome its resource constraints. Also applications life cycle can be extended since the same application can be used on various devices regardless of their resource constraints.

Those skilled in the art will know that primitive operations enabling an Elastic application model for example include data and code offloading when the application is loaded dynamic migration during runtime creating new components or component instances for execution destroying active components and changing adjusting the load balance between active components during runtime.

One general problem or challenge for enabling an effective Elastic application model is identification of benefits and an effective strategy configuration for execution applications between a computing system and one or more computing resource providers. For example one specific problem is saving power especially for battery power of a mobile device. As such when offloading a computing component from a device to a Cloud the cost of power usage associated with offloading the computing component and providing data necessary for its execution can be considered to achieve a more effective Elastic application model for mobile devices. In addition cost of power usage associated with communication between the device and the Cloud to provide input and receive output etc. can be considered.

This problem can be expressed as finding an optimal set of weblets to run remotely weblet r and a set of weblets to run locally weblet l such that the Right Hand Side RHS of a simplified expression shown below is minimized or is at least less than the power cost when all weblets run locally. That is all weblets weblets comm weblet weblet data offloading and Min weblets comm weblet weblet data offloading Where 

It should be noted that the exemplary problem of power consumption can require a dynamic solution for various reasons including data offloading can be very dynamic and application specific even with the same application a different solution may be required depending on the situation as for example input and or output data associated with each instance of execution may vary for the same application. Also such decisions may be even more complicated if the factors associated with power model or power consumption are not static. It should also be noted that the decision making itself typically consumes power especially if a very complex dynamic power model is used.

The same considerations can be made for other numerous execution allocation cost or cost objectives including for example performance e.g. latency throughput monetary cost e.g. monetary costs associated with computing costs and data traffic on a Cloud charged based on a business model and security e.g. whether to execute private applications and or data on a Cloud .

It will be appreciated that an execution allocation cost assessment component or a cost service provider can be operable to make decisions regarding costs associated with allocation of computer executable components on or between various computing systems e.g. computing devices mobile phones and computing resource providers e.g. clouds . Generally a cost service provider can be operable to effectively reduce or minimize cost associated with allocation of executable components based on a cost model. It should be noted that a cost service provider can be operable to make decisions regarding the allocation cost of the executable components during runtime of the executable components. Furthermore the service provider can effectively make decisions and affect execution allocation in real time in a manner that would be more particular and desirable for users.

It will also be appreciated that a cost service provider can be provided that is especially suitable for Elastic computing environments that support Elastic Devices noted above and described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 559 394 entitled EXTENDING THE CAPABILITY OF COMPUTING DEVICES BY USING DYNAMICALLY SCALABLE EXTERNAL RESOURCES filed on Sep. 14 2009.

To further elaborate depicts an Elastic computing environment in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Referring to an execution allocation cost service component is operable to determine the relative cost associated with allocating execution of executable computer code or executable code to or between a computing system and one or more computing resource providers e.g. one or more Clouds . Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the execution allocation cost service component can be provided as or as a part of a computing system e.g. a computing device a server and may operate as a part of in cooperation with a computing resource provider or may be provided as or as part of an independent computing system that may or may not use the resources of a computing resource provider in order to perform various computing or computing related tasks in order to effectively provide a execution allocation cost service to the computing systems and or and one or more computing resource providers .

Referring to a cost modeling agent is operable on an Elastic Device A. Cost modeling agent can include a data or raw data collection subcomponent or module operable to effectively collect execution allocation data that can be obtained and effectively used by the execution allocation cost service component or cost service provider to make decisions regarding the allocation of an application for execution between the Elastic Device A and the computing resource provider . As shown in the cost modeling agent can optionally include additional subcomponent including a pre processing subcomponent operable to preprocess data to provide it in a form that may be more efficient for processing by the computing resource provider e.g. convert raw data to normalized data as generally known in the art . Other exemplary subcomponent s can provide various functions pertaining to execution allocation data and allocation of execution based on the execution allocation data. For example a feature extraction subcomponent can be operable to determine features of patterns of the collected data in order to allow making better decisions regarding execution allocation as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Referring back to it should be noted that a sensing component can be operable to measure and or collect data from various sensors not shown of the device A. The data measured and or collected by the sensing component can be provided by an elasticity manager as execution allocation data to the allocation cost service component .

Generally the cost modeling agent can be operable to measure and or collect data associated with the Elastic Device A and various application environments e.g. application environment of the application . By way of example the cost modeling agent can be operable to measure and or collect device configuration data e.g. data pertaining to CPU memory networks bandwidth power consumption device sensor information e.g. battery status location signal strength temperature speed application runtime information e.g. input output data communication data local execution time .

Optionally the cost modeling agent can be operable to preprocess data or raw data . By way of example data collected in diverse forms can be converted to numerical values before feature extraction operations are performed and learning modeling processes are applied. Also due to differing scales and ranges of numerical values associated with different sources normalization can be applied to various ranges of values for feature extraction and learning modeling processes. If possible data features or patterns can be extracted.

The execution allocation cost service component or cost service provider can include a data collection subcomponent or module a learning and modeling subcomponent e.g. a learning and modeling engine and a decision making subcomponent as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Data collection subcomponent can be operable to measure and or collect data pertaining to computing resource providers e.g. Cloud sensor data can for example include network status status of shared resources status of external data . In addition data collection subcomponent can be operable to collect data and in particular execution allocation data from various cost model agents including the cost model agent of the Elastic Device A. Learning and modeling subcomponent can be operable to effectively learn and model application behavior based on the data collected by the data collection subcomponent . By way of example various algorithms can be developed from simple rule based algorithms including supervised learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and unsupervised learning algorithms such as K means or Vector Quantization . In addition the learning and modeling subcomponent can be operable to run various algorithms based on the data collected and or measured and one or more cost models. Generally the decision making subcomponent can be operable to make decisions regarding the allocation of execution between an Elastic Device A and computing resource providers . Decision making subcomponent can also be operable to generate action requests to various Elasticity or Elastic Managers of Elastic Devices e.g. Elasticity Manager on the Elastic Device A . In addition the decision making subcomponent may be operable to perform various other operations to affect allocation of execution including for example offloading components to a computing resource provider e.g. a Cloud platform create or remove components in or from an Elastic Device A and or computing resource provider perform task dispatch and or allocation between executable components upgrade or downgrade quality of service provided by the cost service provider component to a particular Elastic Device including the Elastic Device A.

It should be noted that Elasticity Manager can be operable to receive decisions or allocation decisions from the decision making subcomponent directly or via the cost service provider as requests or commands and effectively enforce them on the Elastic Device A.

It should be noted that the decision making subcomponent can be operable to determine a current extent of execution allocation based on execution allocation data pertaining to multiple other computing devices. As such the decision making subcomponent can be operable to predict the current extent of execution allocation based on aggregate allocation data that it can obtain and maintain. As noted above for example a learning model can be utilized to make predictions with respect to execution allocation for a particular device and or particular application based on data or historical data that can be collected and maintained for the device a particular application multiple and typically numerous other devices and or applications that are likely to behave in a similar manner as the particular device or application

By way of example execution allocation cost model server or cost model service can be operable to determine the extent of execution allocation of the computer executable computer code A and or B between the mobile device A and the computing resource providers determine the extent of allocation of the computer executable computer code A and or B for execution to or between the mobile device A and the computing resource providers . As such the execution allocation cost model server may for example determine to allocate and or cause allocation of execution such that a first portion of the executable code A is executed using the internal computing resources of the mobile device A a second portion of the executable code A is to be executed using the computing resources of the computing resource provider A a second portion of the executable code A is to be executed using the computing resources of the computing resource provider B and so on. It should be noted that execution allocation cost model server is generally operable to determine the extent of allocation of execution at run time of the executable code e.g. when the executable code is to be loaded for execution or is being executed . By way of example execution allocation cost model server can determine the extent of allocation of execution when one or more portions of the executable code are being executed by the mobile device A and or computing resource provider A.

Generally the execution allocation cost model server can be operable to determine during the runtime of the executable codes a current extent of execution allocation to or between a computing system and various computing resource providers . As a result at a given time during the runtime of a particular executable code e.g. A the execution allocation cost model server can determine a current relative extent of allocation and allocate and or cause allocation of a specific portion the executable code e.g. executable code portion A to or between a specific computing device e.g. mobile device A and one or more computing resource providers in accordance with the current extent of execution allocation. It will also be appreciated that the execution allocation cost model server can be operable to effectively change monitor and or update the current extent of execution allocation dynamically during the runtime of the executable code A such that a specific portion the executable code e.g. executable code portion is for example effectively relocated or migrated from a specific computing device e.g. mobile device A to a particular computing resource provider or vice versa or relocated or migrated from one computing resource provider to another computing resource .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the execution allocation cost model server can be operable to determine a current extent of allocation or a current extent of execution allocation based on data pertaining to allocation of execution of executable computer code or execution allocation data to or between at least one computing system and one or more computing resource provides . Generally the execution allocation data can be based on one or more criteria associated with a computing system and or computing resource . The execution allocation cost model server can obtain execution allocation data as input determine based on the execution allocation data a current extent of execution allocation and provide the current extent of execution allocation as output data that allocates and or causes allocation of execution accordingly e.g. output data as an indication or a command request to a computing system or a computing resource provider .

It should also be noted that the execution allocation cost model server can also be operable to obtain aggregate cost data pertaining to general or specific execution costs associated with execution of various executable code and various computing systems . By way of example general execution cost of a particular executable code e.g. or one of its components on any computing system or specific execution cost of a particular portion of a executable code e.g. on a particular computing system e.g. or computing resource provider e.g. can be obtained and stored as aggregate cost data . As another example execution cost of any executable code executed by a particular computing system e.g. can be logged as historical data.

Historical data can be used to make prediction or estimation regarding execution of particular portion of executable code e.g. . For example historical data pertaining to execution costs of computing systems A and B can be used to make a prediction regarding the cost of execution by the computing C. Similarity of devices cloud resource providers user preferences networks and network connections are among a few examples that can be used to make a prediction re cost of execution.

Generally aggregate cost data can be effectively used by a cost allocation predictor to predict or estimate the cost of allocating execution of a particular portion executable code e.g. on a particular computing system e.g. or computing resource provider e.g. as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. It should also be noted that the cost model server can be operable to effectively use a prediction based on the aggregate cost data instead of using a cost model to make a decision regarding the allocation of execution.

Cost model service can also be operable to distinguish different user preferences and build customized cost models respectively for individual users and or Elastic Devices . In other words the cost model service can provide a personalized or customized cost service. In addition cost model service can be operable to develop or build a cost model that is suitable for a set of users and or devices with similar traits e.g. similar user cost preferences similar device capabilities and or configurations .

To further elaborate the following provides an exemplary power cost model that can be used in connection with the present invention. One objective of the power cost model is to onload offload different components from to a cloud platform during load time and or run time of an application such that its power consumption on the Elastic Device ED is minimal. Note that this exemplary model does not consider execution power consumptions on the cloud platforms.

Once this power model is deployed on the cloud side cost service it decides that it needs to monitor measure the following parameters 

The cost service then decides which parameters are monitored measured by cloud side and ED side for example data communication and network status can be measured on cloud side while execution power cost of ED should be on the ED side.

When the cost service obtains necessary data it can build a power graph for this application and make possible decisions on the graph transformation to make the total power cost minimum and then instruct the EM on the ED to enforce possible actions.

The various aspects features embodiments or implementations of the invention described above can be used alone or in various combinations. The many features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the written description and thus it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention. Further since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art the invention should not be limited to the exact construction and operation as illustrated and described. Hence all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to as falling within the scope of the invention.
