This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 464 949 filed Mar. 11 2011 and entitled DESIGN OF EFFICIENT MULTICOIL TELEMETRY SYSTEM FOR BIOMEDICAL IMPLANTS the entire contents of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference without disclaimer.

This invention was made with government support under grant no. EEC0310723 awarded by The National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates to multicoil telemetry and more particularly relates to transferring power and or data using inductive coupling via a wireless link.

Biomedical implants have actively been in use for stimulation and monitoring internal vital signs. Implanted sensors drug delivery devices neuro stimulator and endoscopes are some of the main devices currently used for medical applications. The power requirement of these devices vary with their applications and can range from a few microwatts to hundreds of milliwatts. Because of power requirements and implant size few devices rely on implanted batteries and most of applications use wireless power transfer to operate the implanted device or to recharge the implanted battery.

Inductive coupling between an external source and an implanted device is a popular technique for wireless power transfer to implanted devices. Traditional inductive coupling based power transfer systems use two coils in which power is transferred from external driver coil to implant load coil. The power transfer efficiency strongly depends on magnetic coupling between the coils which is governed by factors such as size structure physical spacing and relative location of the coils and their electric properties such as a quality factor Q factor . For example magnetic coupling between an external coil and an implant coil is drastically reduced with increase in coil spacing and hence causes rapid change in power transfer efficiency with coil misalignment.

To optimize the power link performance electric models of 2 coil based systems have been used to identify the effect of coil parameters and coupling on link efficiency. Using low resistance wire high unloaded Q factor coil can be achieved but due to use of finite source resistance of a driver and high impedance load a loaded Q factor can only achieve moderate values. Hence there are limits on the maximum achievable power transfer efficiency 40 under these design constraints.

Power transfer efficiency is a commonly used metric for improvement to reduce the required power by an external source for a desired power requirement of implanted devices. For telemetry applications performance is generally measured based on power transfer efficiency as well as on the available voltage gain and data bandwidth over the power link. Performance variations during the operation of a device are one of the main challenges for a 2 coil based system. For example implanted coils may undergo relative motion with respect to external coils during the operation of device which causes variation in mutual coupling between an external coil and an implanted coil. Additionally based on the power requirement of the implanted device effective load resistance may vary and cause variation in the Q factor of a receiving inductive unit. Hence to ensure stable link performance a design should have high tolerance with change in operating distance coil misalignment and device operation mode.

In one embodiment the first intermediate coil and second intermediate coil may be configured to alter the shape of the generated alternating magnetic field to optimize coupling efficiency between the driving coil and the receiving coil . In one embodiment the first intermediate coil and second intermediate coil have a high quality factor Q factor .

With a voltage is provided by the source the driving coil and first intermediate coil may be moved close to the receiving coil in an operable distance. Power may then be transferred from the driving coil to the receiving coil charging the battery.

The coupling factor between the driving inductive unit and the first intermediate inductive unit may be represented as k and the coupling factor between the first intermediate inductive unit and the receiving inductive unit may be represented as k. The first intermediate inductive unit may be configured to alter the shape of the generated alternating magnetic field to optimize coupling efficiency between the driving inductive unit and the receiving inductive unit . The first intermediate inductive unit may also be configured to decouple the resistance of the driving inductive unit and the first intermediate inductive unit such that the combination may achieve a high Q factor e.g. over 200. The driving inductive unit may be connect to a source and its Q factor may be limited by the source resistance. The first intermediate inductive unit is energized by the driving inductive unit s magnetic field. The first intermediate inductive unit is a self resonating passive coil its Q factor is limited by self resistance only and thus it can achieve high Q factor in order of couple of hundreds. Because the resistance of the driving inductive unit does not affect the Q factor of first intermediate inductive unit the driving resistance is decoupled from the first intermediate inductive unit . Same process occurs to decouple resistance of the receiving inductive unit from the high Q intermediate inductive unit.

In the depicted embodiment the coupling factor between the driving inductive unit and the first intermediate inductive unit may be represented as kthe coupling factor between the first intermediate inductive unit and second intermediate inductive unit may be represented as k and the coupling factor between the second intermediate inductive unit and the receiving inductive unit may be represented as k.

In use the embodiments of may function to receive a power signal from an electric source to the driving inductive unit . The driving inductive unit may generate a time alternating magnetic field.

The following description discusses in more detail example results obtained from implementing embodiments such as described above in an experimental setting. It is noted that the following is presented by way of example and that various modifications may be made based on the types of equipment being utilized particular applications and the like. Such modifications are considered within the scope of the novel concepts described in the present application.

Multi coil apparatuses for power and or data transfer are compared to traditional 2 coil based wireless power and or data transfer system. For applications where implanted coils are in use and cannot be replaced a 3 coil based system such as the apparatus shown in may be utilized. To analyze the multi coil systems performance systems may be modeled into simplified topologies based on network theory and circuit theory. Each of the models may have its advantages over the other to characterize the system.

Network model may be based on Kirchoff voltage model for each coil. It uses voltage sources as forcing function and calculates the current I n 2 3 4 in each coil as a function of self and mutual impedance of the coils. Equations 1 2 and 3 shown below formulate the current in each coils for 2 coils 3 coils and 4 coil based system respectively.

Based on network model equation 5 below can be used to calculate the input output power power transfer efficiency and voltage gain of the power transfer system.

Two port equivalent model is a useful method to characterize the system performance with experiments. shows the two port equivalent of 2 coil and multi coil systems using lumped element components.

Similarly for two port model equation 6 below can be used to calculate the input output power power transfer efficiency to load and voltage gain of the 2 coil and multi coil systems.

Network model and two port model can be used to calculate the basic performance matrix efficiency voltage gain bandwidth for power transfer systems. Network model is more generalized and can include the coupling effect between each coil in a more simple manner. Network model can provide information about current in each coil while it is more simple to characterize the two port model of the system experimentally. Using network analyzer S parameters of a 2 port equivalent system can be measured which can be converted to Z parameters to calculate system efficiency and gain. show the simulated voltage gain and efficiency of 3 coil based systems using network model and two port equivalent respectively. The results validate the equivalence between both the models.

Using network model of 2 coil and multi coil systems resonance frequency power transfer efficiency can be calculated as shown in the equations 7 8 and 10 shown below. For a given operating distance and coil dimensions coupling between the coils can be optimized to its maximum values as shown in previous literature. To improve the power transfer efficiency Q factor of the coils may be maximized.

For 2 coil systems with given load condition and source resistance quality factors of the driver and receiving inductive unit are moderate values which restrict the efficiency to low values less than 40 .

To decouple the source resistance from the quality factor of first intermediate inductive unit the driving inductive unit of 2 coil based systems can be divided into two parts called driving and first intermediate inductive units. The first intermediate inductive unit may have a high inductance comparing to the driving inductive unit and at tuned operating frequency it can achieve high quality factor Q . Due to low inductance and moderate source resistance 5 driving inductive unit may have a low quality factor Q . Driving and first intermediate inductive units are strongly coupled k 0.5 and hence power transfer between the driving inductive unit to the first intermediate inductive unit may be efficient. While for a given operating distance fixed k power transfer efficiency between the first intermediate inductive unit and receiving inductive unit may be improved due to high quality factor of first intermediate inductive unit Q .

4 coil based power transfer systems are extensions of 3 coil systems in which objects are implanted can be modified and implantable inductive units can be subdivided to two units called second intermediate inductive unit and receiving inductive unit. This method may decouple the quality factor of receiving inductive unit from high load resistance. Similarly energy can be efficiently transferred between the second intermediate inductive unit and receiving inductive unit. For same dimensions of implanted and outer units 4 coil based system can achieve higher efficiency compare to its 2 coil and 3 coil equivalent due to high quality factor of first and second intermediate inductive units.

For wireless power transfer voltage gain is an important design parameter to achieve a sufficient voltage level to operate the implanted device reliably. Voltage gain V V is a function of coupling and coil quality factors. Equations 12 14 and 16 below show the voltage gain of 2 coil 3 coil and 4 coil based systems respectively.

Similarly at resonance frequency voltage gain of 3 coil based systems can be calculated using equation 14.

For high coupling k kand high Q factor coils Q Q 1 kQQ 1 kQQ kQQand voltage gain can be approximated as equation 17.

Approximated model of voltage gain is useful to visualize the effect of dominant parameters of voltage gain and comparison between the voltage gain of 2 coil 3 coil and 4 coil systems. Multicoil systems provide more parameters for designer to tune the desired voltage gain for given design constraints. shows the change in 3 coil system voltage gain with respect to coupling kwhich concludes that for high coupling k voltage gain of 3 coil systems is lesser than the 2 coil equivalent but with moderate coupling Gis higher than G.

In telemetry applications moderate data bandwidth is essential to send control vital sign signals to from the implanted devices. For two resonating oscillators data bandwidth is directly proportional to coupling between the oscillators. Couple mode theory was used to explain the phenomenon of pole splitting due to coupling between resonating objects. Higher coupling causes higher pole splitting and hence higher bandwidth. For a given operating distance fixed coupling k or k bandwidth of 2 coil is fixed. Multicoil systems use high coupling between driving inductive unit to first intermediate inductive unit k and or receiver to receiving inductive unit k to improve the data bandwidth compared to 2 coil equivalent systems for given operating distance. shows that for given operating distance k and high coupling k 0.2 available bandwidth for 3 coil based systems is higher than its 2 coil equivalent. Due to strong coupling bandwidth increases with the increase in coupling k.

Increasing coupling factor kreduces the voltage gain and increases the available data bandwidth of the system. shows that above moderate coupling k 0.25 gain bandwidth product is constant and higher than its 2 coil equivalents. It provides the design trade off to tune the gain and bandwidth based on design requirements.

For practical designs during device operation coil distance between external and implantable coil can vary from its nominal values and cause decay in coupling between coils. Hence wireless power links should compensate the change in coupling k or k . Some implantable devices have different operating mode and hence reflect different load to the receiving inductive unit. Hence power transfer link performance efficiency voltage gain and bandwidth should be less susceptible to device operation range and device operation mode.

To formulate the variation in power transfer efficiency with respect to coil distance variation coupling k or k rate of change in efficiency for 2 coil 3 coil and 4 coil systems are shown by equations 18 19 and 20 below respectively. Due to high quality factors of first and second intermediate inductive units multicoil system efficiency has lower rate of change compared to 2 coil equivalent.

To ensure the reliable device operation voltage variation at device input should be smaller with change in operating distance changes. With changes in coupling between external and implanted inductive units equations 21 22 and 23 below formulate the voltage gain variation for 2 coil 3 coil and 4 coil systems respectively.

From it can be seen that the 2 coil and 3 coil systems show similar voltage gain tolerance with coil distance variations as expected from equation 24.

For telemetry application to keep the sufficient data bandwidth with distance variation bandwidth should be independent of coupling k or k . In multicoil systems due to high coupling between driver and first intermediate inductive unit or second intermediate and receiving inductive unit bandwidth is dominantly governed by the k or k . With change in the coupling k or k multi coil system shows small variation in bandwidth. shows the bandwidth variation normalized for k or k 0.055 for 3 coil and 2 coil systems which depicts that for 3 coil bandwidth remains almost constant with changes in distance between inductive units.

2 coil based systems efficiency is a strong function of source resistance. Due to decoupling of source resistance from first intermediate inductive unit multicoil shows lower dependence of efficiency on source resistance variation. Equations 25 26 and 27 show the variation of efficiency with respect to source resistance R for 2 coil 3 coil and 4 coil systems respectively.

During implanted device operation based on operating mode fully partially active current requirement changes which causes change in effective load resistance on receiving inductive unit. Equations 28 29 and 30 below show the efficiency variations with changes in load resistance which concludes that multi coil systems are more tolerant to load resistance variations.

In wireless transfer system load impedance can be seen as reflected resistance on input sources. To transfer maximum power to the load with a given input voltage reflected impedance should be matched to source resistance. It limits the maximum power transfer efficiency to 50 as half of power is dissipated at source resistance.

Using network model reflected load impedance at source can be calculated by V I. Equations 31 32 and 33 below show the total resistance seen by source due to self and input reflected load resistance in terms of coils parameters.

Rcan be written as a function of loading factor N which is used to define the matching factor p as shown in equation 34. Loading factor is a positive real number matching factor lies between 0 and 1 for all values of N and p denotes the ratio of power delivered to maximum delivered power for given source voltage.

For 2 coil 3 coil and 4 coil systems loading factors and resultant power transfer efficiency factors can be determined by equations 35 36 and 37 below. For maximum power transfer the loading factor should be 1 for which matching factor equals to 1.

For 2 coil systems loading factor is less than 1 0.2 0.5 . Hence matching condition cannot be achieved for 2 coil systems.

In 3 coil systems for a given coupling k loading factors can be controlled by varying kand Q. Hence it can easily achieve the matching factor of value 1. For example for k 0.25 Q 0.44 Q 160 Q 7 k 0.055 loading factor and matching factor is 1 for which the power transfer efficiency is 38.6 .

Similarly in 4 coil systems for a given operating distance hence fixed k kand kcan be used to match the load with the source for maximum power transfer.

To compare the efficiency improvement due to multi coil based systems for existing implanted devices two well known implanted coils are used as receiving inductive units published before. Where implanted coil cannot be changed 3 coil based systems are used. Four set of experiments were performed to distinguish the efficiency improvement for different coil types effect of Q factor on system efficiency bandwidth of wireless links and efficiency tolerance with changes in coupling between external and implanted coils.

A 50 sinusoidal source is used to generate a signal at desired frequency. The efficiency is calculated from the output terminal of the signal source and a resistance of 5.1 is used in series with the driving inductive unit to emulate the typical source resistance of power amplifier used for telemetry application. Table I provides the electrical and mechanical parameters for the three designs. and show the block diagram of concentric intermediate and driving inductive units for Designs 1 2 and 3. Depending on application and system constraints the implanted coil s dimension can range from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm. Four experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effects of high quality factor intermediate coil and operating distance variation.

Experiment 1 was conducted using Design 1 system parameters to compare the efficiency gain and bandwidth of 2 coil systems and their 3 coil equivalents. Table I column Design 1 provides the electrical mechanical and operating conditions of 2 coil and 3 coil systems. For fair comparison overall mechanical dimensions of the systems were kept the same. shows the schematic diagram of the implanted coils for Designs 1 2 and 3. 

Experiment 2 uses Design 2 system parameters to compare between 2 coil systems and their 3 coil equivalents as shown in Table I column Design 2 . Design 2 uses the same retinal coils implanted coil and operating conditions frequency and distance of operation . Partial inductance method was used to simulate the self inductance of retinal coil and its mutual inductance with external coils. shows the schematic diagram of the implanted coils for Design 1 2 and 3.

Experiment 3 was performed to design and show the effect of high quality factor first intermediate inductive unit on system efficiency. It uses the low resistance multi strand Litz wire to improve the quality factor. Table I column Design 3 shows the system parameters of 2 coil systems and their 3 coil equivalents. Design 3 uses the same elliptical retinal coils used for experiment 2.

To ensure system performance for different operating condition efficiency tolerance should be small. For retinal implants due to rotation motion eye coupling between implanted and external coils changes and causes changes in the power transfer efficiency. Experiment 4 was performed to identify the efficiency tolerance of Design 3 system with 2 coil systems and their 3 coil equivalents. shows the set up to emulate the eye ball rotation for retinal implants.

For retinal coil under defined operating conditions Experiment 2 shows the simulated and measured efficiency of 2 coil and 3 coil systems. For same operating conditions and system dimensions 3 coil systems show more than 2 times efficiency compared to their 2 coil equivalents.

To compare the tolerance of power transfer systems with change in coupling between external and implanted coil shows the simulated and experimental results for efficiency variation with respect to coil rotation angle. For 3 coil systems due to high Qfactor of first intermediate inductive unit effect of coupling variation is compensated by Qand hence variation is small compared to 2 coil equivalents.

For telemetry applications to compare the system performance of 2 coil systems with their multicoil equivalents it is helpful to define performance metrics. For wireless power and data transfer efficiency voltage gain bandwidth and system dimensions may be key parameters. For many telemetry designs voltage gain is one of design parameters and figure of merit FOM is defined in equation 38. FOM is a unit less quantity where higher value depicts the better system performance.

Table II summarizes the performance metric of 2 coil systems and its 3 coil equivalents for all three designs. It can be seen that for all the designs multicoil systems perform better than 2 coil systems in terms of power and data transfer.
