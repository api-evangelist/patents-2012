With prevailing of portable communication devices such as smart phones and tablets more and more people worry about security for operating systems of the portable communication devices. In current practices when an operating system of a portable communication device is crashed the portable communication device may be connected with a computer via a data line or a universal serial bus USB to copy an operating system image from the computer. Usually before the copying the computer may online search and download the operating system image suitable for the portable communication device

In an embodiment the system detection module may detect a system of the portable communication device during a system boot process including detecting whether the operating system is crashed e.g. because of a malicious attack to the portable communication device . If the operating system is crashed the system detection module may send a recovery request to the recovery agent . However it should be understood that other embodiments may implement other technologies for the recovery request.

Referring to the method on the left in block when booting the system of the portable communication device the system detection module may check hardware and software of the system. If in block the system detection module detects that the operating system is crashed before being loaded into a memory of the portable communication device then in blocks the portable communication device may display the information about the operating system being crashed on its screen and detect whether the user presses a key to request the operating system recovery. If the user presses the key then in block the NFC module or other device may detect whether the portable communication device having a good operating system image suitable for the portable communication device exists within a NFC communication distance. In response to detecting the existence of the portable communication device the recovery manager or other device may initiate a session with the recovery manager or other device in block .

In block the portable communication device may reboot and load the operating system image to the memory.

Referring now to the method on the right in block the NFC module or other device may detect whether the portable communication device exists within a NFC communication distance. In response to detecting the existence of the portable communication device the recovery manager or other device may initiate a session with the recovery manager or other device in block . For example the recovery manager may coordinate the NFC module to connect with the portable communication device and obtain the network address of the portable communication device based on the NFC technologies. In an embodiment after the session is initiated the NFC module may disconnect the NFC connection with the portable communication device .

Examples of the operating system image may include the operating system except for any data or codes desired to keep secret from the portable communication device e.g. the private data. In another embodiment the operating system image may be obtained from a third party e.g. an online source and pre stored in the portable communication device .

In block the recovery manager or other device may obtain the operating system image using the read write module and send the operating system image to the portable communication device .

It should be understood that other embodiments may implement other technologies for the system and method as discussed above. In an embodiment the process of displaying the operating system being crashed on the screen and waiting for the user to press the key may be omitted. On the contrary when the system detection module detects that the operating system is crashed the system detection module or other device may send the recovery agent with the request of recovering the operating system in response to which the recovery agent can start connecting with the portable communication device and recover the operating system. In another embodiment the portable communication device may recover the operating system even if the operating system hasn t been crashed. For example during the system boot process the user may initiatively request the operating system recovery e.g. through pressing a special key rather than requesting the recovery after receiving the notification of the operating system being crashed.
