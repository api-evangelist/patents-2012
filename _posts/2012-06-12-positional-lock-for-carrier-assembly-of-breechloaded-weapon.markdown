title: Positional lock for carrier assembly of breech-loaded weapon
abstract: A breech assembly for a weapon may include a breech ring and a carrier fixed to a shaft. The shaft may be rotatably mounted to the breech ring. A breech block may be fixed to the carrier and insertable into and out of an opening in the breech ring by rotating the shaft. A notch may be formed in an end of the shaft. A lock may be translatably disposed in the breech ring and translatable into and out of the notch in the end of the shaft. Translation of the lock into the notch may rotatably lock the shaft with respect to the breech ring.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Direct and indirect fire weapons for example cannons and or breech loaded mortars may include a screw block and carrier assembly at the breech end of the weapon. The screw block and carrier assembly may be opened for maintenance. Known apparatus for retaining the screw block and carrier assembly in an open position include a non rigid strap a block of wood or a rod. The strap is unsafe because it may slip. The block of wood is unsafe because it may disintegrate. The rod generally requires more than one person to safely deploy. All three methods are time consuming and potentially dangerous to the maintenance operator.

A long felt and unsolved need exists for an apparatus and method that enables a single person to rapidly and safely lockout a screw block and carrier in an open position at a predetermined angle.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method that enables a single person to rapidly and safely lockout a screw block and carrier in an open position at a predetermined angle.

A breech assembly for a weapon may include a breech ring and a carrier fixed to a shaft. The shaft may be rotatably mounted to the breech ring. A breech block may be fixed to the carrier. The breech block may be insertable into and out of an opening in the breech ring by rotating the shaft. A notch may be formed in an end of the shaft. A lock may be translatably disposed in the breech ring and translatable into and out of the notch in the end of the shaft. Translation of the lock into the notch may rotatably lock the shaft with respect to the breech ring.

The lock may include a slide body and a spring that biases the slide body towards the shaft. The slide body may include grooves formed therein for retaining the slide body in the breech ring. The lock may include a latching assembly for securing the lock out of engagement with the notch.

In one embodiment the latching assembly may include a plunger disposed in a bore in the slide body and a plunger spring that biases the plunger toward the breech ring. The plunger may include a detent on an end thereof. Another end of the plunger may include a knob for pulling the plunger.

In another embodiment the latching assembly may include a pivoting latch that is rotatably fixed to the slide body and selectively engageable with the breech ring. The latching assembly may include a latch spring that biases the pivoting latch toward the breech ring. The slide body may include a hinge pin on which the pivoting latch is rotatably mounted. The pivoting latch may include a slotted opening at an end distal the hinge pin. The pivoting latch may include a button and the breech ring may include a keyhole slot. The button may be selectively engageable with the keyhole slot.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A positional lock may allow a single operator to rapidly and safely open or lockout a screw block and carrier of a weapon at a predetermined angular position. The operator may deploy the locking device prior to opening the breech block. The breech block and carrier assembly may be safely locked out when for example notches in the crank or crank end align with a locking tab.

A semi automatic locking mechanism may deploy a locking tab into a notch to securely hold the screw block and carrier assembly open during maintenance operations. The locking mechanism may be located on the breech ring. The locking mechanism may be activated by releasing a knob and or a latch. Releasing the knob or latch may cause a spring loaded locking tab to deploy into a notch. The notch may be located on the crank or the crank end. The tab and notch may firmly lock and hold the breech block and carrier assembly in an open position at a specified angle.

Lock may include a latching assembly for preventing slide body from translating toward crank end . The latching assembly may also secure slide body in a locked position such as shown in for example wherein end engages notch . The latching assembly may include a plunger disposed in a bore in slide body . A plunger spring may bias plunger toward breech ring . Plunger may include a detent . Detent may be removably disposed in detent holes not shown in breech ring . One detent hole may correspond to the position of lock shown in and one detent hole may correspond to the position of lock shown in .

A plunger knob may be fixed to plunger using for example a split spring pin . Pin may be inserted in knob opening and plunger hole . Plunger knob may be used to pull on plunger and release detent from a detent hole in breech ring . For example before breech block is removed from opening in breech ring one may pull on plunger knob to remove detent from its detent hole in breech ring . Spring may then translate slide body toward crank end . Breech block may then be removed from opening in breech ring by rotating carrier as seen in . As crank end rotates slide body may bear against the perimeter of crank end until end of slide body seats in notch and locks carrier and breech block in position. Then detent may extend into a detent hole not shown formed in breech ring .

Shaft may include a crank . Crank may include a notch formed in a periphery thereof. A lock may be translatably disposed in breech ring . Lock may be translatable into and out of notch in crank . Notch may be formed at various locations on the periphery of crank to thereby lock breech block in various angular positions. is a side perspective view of breech assembly showing breech block in a locked open position. is a top perspective view of breech assembly showing breech block in the locked open position.

Lock may include a latching assembly for preventing slide body from translating toward crank . The latching assembly may include pivoting latch . Pivoting latch may be rotatably fixed to slide body and selectively engageable with breech ring . The latching assembly may include a latch spring that biases pivoting latch toward breech ring . Latch spring may be disposed in an interior of slide body . Latch spring may be connected at one end to a spring pin disposed in an opening in pivoting latch . Another end of latch spring may be connected to a spring pin . Spring pin may also be disposed in the interior of slide body .

Slide body may include a hinge pin on which pivoting latch is rotatably mounted. Hinge pin may be disposed in openings in slide body and in opening in pivoting latch . Pivoting latch may include a slotted opening at an end of latch that is distal hinge pin . As seen in the top perspective view of slotted opening may be used to manipulate pivoting latch from above using for example a flat screwdriver that may be inserted in slotted opening .

Pivoting latch may include a button . Breech ring may include a keyhole slot . Button may be selectively engageable with keyhole slot . In button is engaged with an upper portion of keyhole slot . Movement of pivoting latch downward for example using one s hand or using a tool in slotted opening moves button to the lower larger portion of keyhole slot . Pivoting latch may then be rotated outward as shown in . Spring may then bias slide body against crank . As crank rotates spring may bias end of slide body into notch in crank thereby securing breech block in an open position .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
