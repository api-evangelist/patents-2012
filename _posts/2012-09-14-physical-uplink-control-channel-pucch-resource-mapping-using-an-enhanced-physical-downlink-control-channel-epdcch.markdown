This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 612 188 filed Mar. 16 2012.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station or a transceiver node and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

In LTE data can be transmitted from the eNodeB to the UE via a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH . A physical downlink control channel PDCCH can be used to transfer downlink control information DCI that informs the UE about resource allocations or scheduling related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH uplink resource grants and uplink power control commands. The PDCCH can be transmitted prior the PDSCH in each subframe transmitted from the eNodeB to the UE.

The PDCCH signal can be designed to be demodulated at the UE based on a cell specific reference signal CRS . However the use of a CRS does not take into account the increased complexities of advanced LTE systems. For instance in heterogeneous networks multiple nodes can simultaneously transmit within a single cell. The use of the cell specific reference signal can limit advanced techniques to increase cell capacity.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The communication of data on the physical downlink shared channel PDSCH can be controlled via a control channel referred to as a physical downlink control channel PDCCH . The PDCCH can be used for downlink DL and uplink UL resource assignments transmit power commands and paging indicators. The PDSCH scheduling grant can be designated to a particular wireless device e.g. UE for dedicated PDSCH resource allocation to carry UE specific traffic or it can be designated to all wireless devices in the cell for common PDSCH resource allocation to carry broadcast control information such as system information or paging.

In one example the PDCCH and PDSCH can represent elements of a radio frame structure transmitted on the physical PHY layer in a downlink transmission between a node e.g. eNodeB and the wireless device e.g. UE using a generic long term evolution LTE frame structure as illustrated in .

Each slot for a component carrier CC used by the node and the wireless device can include multiple resource blocks RBs and based on the CC frequency bandwidth. The CC can have a carrier frequency having a bandwidth and center frequency. Each subframe of the CC can include downlink control information DCI found in the legacy PDCCH. The legacy PDCCH in the control region can include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or physical RB PRB when a legacy PDCCH is used. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols or 14 OFDM symbols when legacy PDCCH is not used in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data for short or normal cyclic prefix .

Each RB physical RB or PRB can include 12 15 kHz subcarriers on the frequency axis and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM symbols on the time axis per slot. The RB can use seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB can use six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements REs using short or normal cyclic prefixing or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs not shown using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol by one subcarrier i.e. 15 kHz .

Each RE can transmit two bits and of information in the case of quadrature phase shift keying QPSK modulation. Other types of modulation may be used such as 16 quadrature amplitude modulation QAM or 64 QAM to transmit a greater number of bits in each RE or bi phase shift keying BPSK modulation to transmit a lesser number of bits a single bit in each RE. The RB can be configured for a downlink transmission from the eNodeB to the UE or the RB can be configured for an uplink transmission from the UE to the eNodeB.

Each wireless device may use at least one signal bandwidth carrier bandwidth or component carrier CC as illustrated in . For example the LTE CC bandwidths can include 1.4 MHz 3 MHz 5 MHz 10 MHz 15 MHz and 20 MHz . The 1.4 MHz CC can include 6 RBs comprising 72 subcarriers. The 3 MHz CC can include 15 RBs comprising 180 subcarriers. The 5 MHz CC can include 25 RBs comprising 300 subcarriers. The 10 MHz CC can include 50 RBs comprising 600 subcarriers. The 15 MHz CC can include 75 RBs comprising 900 subcarriers. The 20 MHz CC can include 100 RBs comprising 1200 subcarriers.

The data carried on the PDCCH can be referred to as downlink control information DCI . Multiple wireless devices can be scheduled in one subframe of a radio frame. Therefore multiple DCI messages can be sent using multiple PDCCHs. The DCI information in a PDCCH can be transmitted using one or more control channel elements CCE . A CCE can be comprised of a group of resource element groups REGs . A legacy CCE can include up to nine REGs. Each REG can be comprised of four resource elements REs . Each resource element can include two bits of information when quadrature modulation is used. Therefore a legacy CCE can include up to 72 bits of information. When more than 72 bits of information are needed to convey the DCI message multiple CCEs can be employed. The use of multiple CCEs can be referred to as an aggregation level. In one example the aggregation levels can be defined as 1 2 4 or 8 consecutive CCEs allocated to one PDCCH.

The legacy PDCCH can create limitations to advances made in other areas of wireless communication. For example mapping of CCEs to subframes in OFDM symbols is typically spread over the control region to provide spatial diversity. However no beam forming diversity may be possible with the current mapping procedures.

Moreover the capacity of the legacy PDCCH may not be sufficient for advanced control signaling. For instance networks may be configured as heterogeneous networks HetNets can include a number of different kinds of nodes in a single macro cell serving area. More wireless devices can be served simultaneously by macro and pico cells in the HetNet. The PDCCH can be designed to demodulate based on cell specific reference signals CRS which can make fully exploring cell splitting gain difficult. The legacy PDCCH may not be adequate to convey the information needed to allow a wireless device to take advantage of the multiple transmission nodes in the HetNet to increase bandwidth and decrease battery usage at the wireless device.

In addition the use of multi user multiple input multiple output MU MIMO machine to machine communication M2M PDSCH transmission in a multicast broadcast single frequency network and cross carrier scheduling in carrier aggregation can require increased capacity for the PDCCH. The use of UE specific reference signals UERS in PDCCH demodulation at the wireless device can allow the use of multiple nodes in the HetNet. Rather than relying on a single common reference symbol e.g. CRS for an entire cell each reference symbol can be UE specific e.g. UERS .

For example more wireless devices e.g. UEs can be scheduled per sub frame for a MU MIMO operation which can increase the PDCCH resource demand for downlink scheduling. The legacy PDCCH design with a maximum PDCCH size of 3 OFDM symbols may not meet the increased PDCCH resource demand which can consequently limit a gain from MU MIMO.

A PDCCH extension called enhanced PDCCH ePDCCH or E PDCCH located in the PDSCH region can use PRB based instead of a CCE based PDCCH design multiplexing to increase the PDCCH capacity and improve enhanced inter cell interference coordination eICIC support in HetNet scenarios. A legacy PDCCH can be limited in performing inter cell interference coordination ICIC due to PDCCH interleaving of the control channel elements CCEs used for the transmission of DCI formats in PDCCH which can be distributed over an entire bandwidth BW . Conversely the enhanced PDCCH E PDCCH in the PDSCH region can be designed using a PRB based scheme to support frequency domain ICIC.

In an example ICIC can be used to decrease interference between neighboring cells or nodes e.g. coordination nodes or cooperation nodes by lowering the power of a part of the subchannels in the frequency domain which then can be received close to the node. The subchannels do not interfere with the same subchannels used in neighboring cells and thus data can be sent to mobile devices with less interference on the subchannels close to the cell.

Another ICIC technique is enhanced ICIC eICIC used in the time domain for heterogeneous networks HetNets where a high power macro cell can be complemented with low power nodes such as pico cells hotspots in shopping centers or at airports or femto cells hotspots in small areas such as homes or businesses . The low power nodes can exist inside a macro cell coverage area. The macro cell can transmit long range high power signals and the low power nodes can transmit low power signals over short distances. In an example to mitigate interference between the macro cell and the several low power nodes located within the macro cell coverage area eICIC can coordinate the blanking of subframes in the time domain in the macro cell. As used herein a cell can refer to the node e.g. eNB configured to communicate with wireless devices within a geographic region that is referred to as a cell coverage area.

The enhanced PDCCH ePDCCH can use the REs in an entire PRB or PRB pair where a PRB pair is two contiguous PRBs using the same subcarrier s subframe to overcome the limitations of the legacy PDCCH which uses just the first one to three columns of OFDM symbols in a first slot PRB in a subframe. Accordingly the ePDCCH can be configured with increased capacity to allow advances in the design of cellular networks and to minimize currently known challenges.

Unlike the legacy PDCCH the ePDCCH can be mapped to the same REs or region in a PRB as the PDSCH but in different PRBs. In an example the PDSCH and the ePDCCH may not be multiplexed within a same PRB or a same PRB pair . Thus if one PRB or one PRB pair contains an ePDCCH the unused REs in the PRB or PRB pair may be blanked since the REs may not be used for the PDSCH.

The PRB or PRB pair can be used to support both localized ePDCCH and distributed ePDCCH transmissions. illustrate localized ePDCCH and distributed ePDCCH in a slot or a subframe. In a localized ePDCCH the entire CCE may be within a PRB and or PRB pair within a sub band and as illustrated in . In an example the REGs or REs of the localized CCE can be contiguous to each other which may be followed by a subsequent CCE. In a distributed ePDCCH the REGs and of the CCE can be distributed over multiple PRBs and or PRB pairs . The REG s in one PRB and the REG s in another PRB can form the CCE for the DCI or the distributed ePDCCH. In distributed ePDCCH the REGs for a CCE can be distributed over two or more PRBs or two or more PRB pairs . In an example the REGs of the CCEs used in the distributed ePDCCH can be distributed over different sub bands and

A localized ePDCCH having aggregation level AGL one can be mapped to a single CCE which can be mapped to a single RB as shown in . Similarly a localized ePDCCH with an aggregation level of two may be mapped to two contiguous CCEs in a RB. For a distributed ePDCCH and the CCE s e.g. CCE and CCE N can mapped to a plurality of REGs in different RBs in different frequency carriers and subcarriers. For example the REGs for the CCE N can be distributed in frequency. The frequency separation of the REGs can provide a frequency diversity gain. In an example each REG in a CCE may be mapped to a separate RB although more than one REG may be mapped to a same RB as another REG. A greater frequency diversity gain that can occur with widely distributed the REGs. The REGs in CCE and CCE N may have the same distribution shown or different distribution not shown amongst RBs in a subframe. While the REGs illustrated in the distributed ePDCCH and are each shown to be in the same time position within a RB for each respective CCE a same time position within a RB for the distributed ePDCCH is not required. The distributed REGs in CCE and CCE N may be in a different temporal location within a resource block. Each CCE in a subframe may have a same number of REGs or a different number of REGs. The distributed ePDCCH can have an aggregation level of one. The aggregation level of one implies that the DCI information can be mapped to a single CCE.

The distribution of the REGs in a CCE over frequency to different resource blocks in a subframe can provide an increase in frequency diversity gain. illustrates a distributed ePDCCH and transmission.

In another example when the ePDCCH has an aggregation level greater than one e.g. aggregation level or the CCE can include localized CCE or distributed CCEs. A localized CCE can be CCEs for an ePDCCH with an aggregation level greater than one that are contiguous to each other which may be followed by a subsequent CCE in time or frequency. A distributed CCE can be CCEs for an ePDCCH with an aggregation level greater than one that are non contiguous or CCEs distributed over multiple PRBs or PRB pairs .

Using an ePDCCH can change a physical uplink control channel PUCCH resource assignment as compared to a legacy PDCCH. As shown in the a PUCCH resource assignment for a dynamic uplink UL acknowledgment negative acknowledgment ACK NACK for a legacy PDCCH can be jointly determined by a lowest CCE index e.g. n and a dynamic and or semi static boundary index e.g. Nor N configured by higher layer signaling such as radio resource control RRC signaling. For example in legacy LTE a resource index nfor a dynamic ACK NACK in the form of uplink control information UCI formats can be implicitly derived from n n Nwhere nis the number of the first CCE i.e. a lowest CCE index used to construct the PDCCH used for transmission of a corresponding DCI assignment and N see N of is a PUCCH resource value configured by higher layers such as RRC signaling. The superscript 1 can refer to UCI formats . The PUCCH resource allocation can be derived from a legacy PDCCH CCE number. Because the ePDCCH can use a different structure from the PDCCH located in the legacy PDSCH region the legacy PUCCH ACK NACK resource mapping may not be used to map a PUCCH resource for a hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement HARQ ACK transmission corresponding to a downlink DL grant transmitted in ePDCCH because of an unavailable linkage between an ePDCCH resource index and the legacy PUCCH ACK NACK resource. illustrates both the PUCCH and PUSCH resources mapping assignment for a dynamic uplink UL acknowledgment negative acknowledgment ACK NACK other control information and other PUSCH data.

The PUCCH can include an uplink physical channel carrying uplink control information UCI including channel quality indicators CQI hybrid automatic retransmission request HARQ ACK NACK A N and uplink scheduling requests. Uplink control information UCI can include control signaling e.g. ACKnowledgement ACK Negative ACK NACK and channel quality indicator CQI transmitted from a wireless device e.g. UE to a node e.g. eNodeB . The ACK can be a signal transmitted to indicate that one or more blocks of data e.g. ePDCCH PRB have been successfully received and decoded. The NACK can be a signal transmitted to indicate that one or more blocks of data have not been successfully received and decoded.

PUCCH resources mapping based on ePDCCH can be applied to a frequency division duplexing FDD system i.e. method 1 or time division duplexing TDD system i.e. method 2 . Time division duplexing TDD is an application of time division multiplexing TDM to separate downlink and uplink signals. In TDD downlink signals and uplink signals may be carried on a same carrier frequency where the downlink signals use a different time interval from the uplink signals so the downlink signals and the uplink signals do not generate interference for each other. TDM is a type of digital multiplexing in which two or more bit streams or signals such as a downlink or uplink are transferred apparently simultaneously as sub channels in one communication channel but are physically taking turns on the channel. In frequency division duplexing FDD an uplink transmission and a downlink transmission can operate using different frequency carriers. In FDD interference can be avoided because the downlink signals use a different frequency carrier from the uplink signals.

The PUCCH resources can be mapped based on a number of scheduled wireless devices instead of active wireless devices in a cell where the PUCCH resource can be mapped depending on a corresponding ePDCCH lowest PRB index. PUCCH collisions can be reduced or minimized when the PUCCH resources mapping uses an ePDCCH lowest PRB index which can be different from a PDCCH lowest CCE index.

As illustrated in an enhanced control channel element eCCE can consists of a set of predefined resource elements REs within a PRB pair in a downlink subframe that can be used to define the mapping of an enhanced control channel e.g. ePDCCH to resource elements. The eCCE may contain REs that are reserved for other signals such as a CRS a channel state information reference signal CSI RS a UE specific reference signal UERS a demodulation reference signal DMRS and or other reference signals. In the example shown in the DMRS use antenna ports AP and and AP and . In case of multiple eCCEs multiplexed in one PRB the REs mapping of each eCCE with an increasing index can follow a frequency first mapping order to leverage frequency diversity in case that an eCCE aggregation level is greater than one as shown in . Within each eCCE the REs mapping can follow timing first mapping not shown within a slot .

For FDD i.e. method 1 a PUCCH resource mapping method in an uplink subframe corresponding to ePDCCH for HARQ ACK feedback can use a first PRB index Iof ePDCCH detected as represented by the following equation referred to herein as Equation 1 Equation 1 where 0 n0 and N 0 are configured by higher layers in UE specific or cell specific way e.g. for a specified RS Iis the lowest PRB index including at least one eCCE of ePDCCH resources E is the total number of eCCE in one PRB.

The number of the first eCCE ncan be a lowest CCE index used to construct the ePDCCH used for transmission of a corresponding DCI assignment. In the example shown in E can be 4 for eCCE eCCE where eCCEis represented by n 0 eCCEis represented by n 1 eCCEis represented by n 2 eCCEis represented by n 3 . The eCCE within the lowest PRB index can include part or full of ePDCCH resources. The wireless device e.g. UE can use the PUCCH resource n in an ePUCCH region mapped with Equation 1 for transmission of HARQ ACK if a corresponding PDCCH detected according to the pre defined HARQ timing. The PUCCH resource ncan be mapped in a RB of the uplink subframe. The E I N n and Ncan be positive integers.

As illustrated in the Nparameter can refer to the ePDCCH region starting PRB index in the uplink subframe . The E PDCCH region in the downlink subframe may not start from an index because the node may attempt to select better PRBs for an E PDCCH transmission based on CQI feedback from the wireless device. For example the PRB staring from PRB to PRB with a lowest PRB index I including at least one eCCE of E PDCCH resources may have a much better channel quality for the E PDCCH transmission. When the wireless device performs the PUCCH mapping for the E PDCCH the wireless device can take into account the offset value of the E PDCCH e.g. N 10 and shift the mapped PUCCH which can reduce uplink control overhead. illustrates the PUCCH resource nmapping with Nand without N

The starting index N of ePUCCH resources for HARQ ACK transmission with PUCCH format can be similar to the legacy starting index N of ePUCCH resources for HARQ ACK transmission in the uplink subframe where Nand Nare positive integers as shown in . In an example uplink control signaling can be divided generally into two categories Downlink data associated control signaling such as HARQ ACK and non associated control signaling such as CQI precoding matrix indicator PMI rank indicator RI and or scheduling request SR .

Non associated control signaling region such as CQI can be transmitted on band edge RBs in a CQI region using PUCCH format followed by a mixed PUCCH PRB of CQI PUCCH format AND SR HARQ ACK format in a hybrid region . The starting index Ncan be used to indicate the starting index of PUCCH resources in a HARQ ACK region for legacy PDCCH for HARQ ACK transmission with PUCCH format . Similarly the starting index Ncan indicate the starting index of PUCCH resources associated with HARQ ACK for ePDCCH since the legacy PUCCH region can exist in the same uplink subframe as shown in . The node e.g. eNB can signal the offset value Nfor ePDCCH mapping to avoid a PUCCH collision between E PDCCH and legacy PDCCH regions.

For example without Nin Equation 1 the eCCEin PRB of E PDCCH can be associated with PUCCH channel which can generate an unavoidable collision with CCE cce  in the legacy PDCCH region if a legacy DCI is transmitted in the legacy PDCCH region. To avoid the signal collision the node can set the starting index Nbased on a reserved maximum PUCCH channel for the legacy PDCCH region. For example if the node knows the maximum PUCCH channels for legacy PDCCH region is up to PUCCH channel then the node can set the N 101 by reserving the first 100 PUCCH channels for legacy PDCCH region which can minimize collisions between HARQ ACK for legacy PDCCH and HARQ ACK for ePDCCH.

The starting index Nand Ncan indicate the PUCCH channel index offset where starting index Nand Ncan have units of PUCCH channel instead of PRB. In an example one PRB can accommodate up to 36 PUCCH channels. The starting index Nand Ncan correspond to a PUCCH channel index of the UL subframe not a PRB or an eCCE of the DL subframe.

The concept of REG may be used with legacy PDCCH instead of PRB. The legacy PDCCH can be transmitted in CCEs where each CCE can corresponds to sets of four physical resources elements known as REGs. E PDCCH can be associated with PRB which can be different from the legacy PDCCH region.

For a localized mode continuous mode e.g. mode the eCCE with ePDCCH transmission for a DCI e.g. DCI 1 can be mapped into two continuous PRBs e.g. PRB and including eight eCCEs and e.g. aggregation level . The parameters value used for PUCCH resource mapping can be set I 17 and n 0 based on the ePDCCH detected. The corresponding PUCCH resource nfor the localized mode of the ePDCCH illustrated in can be calculated using Equation 1 as n 4 17 0 0 36 104 PUCCH channel.

In an another embodiment TDD ACK NACK bundling or TDD ACK NACK multiplexing i.e. method 2 can be used to map PUCCH resources corresponding to ePDCCH for HARQ ACK feedback in an uplink subframe n as represented by Equation 2. Equation 2 Where nis the number of first eCCE used for transmission of a corresponding ePDCCH in subframe n kand the corresponding 0 m M 1 where kis the smallest value in set K such that the wireless device detects a PDCCH in subframe n k.

Because TDD uses the same frequency carrier for both downlink and uplink transmissions feedback e.g. ACK NACK feedback on the uplink transmission can be transmitted on subframes allocated for uplink transmissions based on an uplink downlink UL DL subframe configuration. Table 1 illustrates seven UL DL configurations used in LTE where D represents a downlink subframe S represents a special subframe and U represents an uplink subframe.

As illustrated by Table 1 UL DL configuration 0 can include 6 uplink subframes in frames 2 3 4 7 8 and 9 and provide feedback for downlink and special subframes 0 1 5 and 6 and UL DL configuration 5 can include one uplink subframe in frame 2 and provide feedback for downlink and special subframes 0 1 3 9. Each uplink subframe n can be associated with a downlink subframe based on the uplink downlink configuration where each uplink subframe n can have a downlink association set index K k k . . . k where M is defined as the number of elements in set K as illustrated by Table 2.

The Table 2 shows examples of downlink subframe bundling in an uplink subframe handling ACK NACK feedback for certain downlink subframe s . For example in uplink downlink configuration 4 uplink subframe 2 subframe n handles ACK NACK feedback for downlink and special subframes which are 12 8 7 11 subframes subframes k earlier than uplink subframe 2 i.e. downlink and special subframes 0 4 5 1 or downlink and special subframes n k and M equals 4. Uplink subframe 3 subframe n handles ACK NACK feedback for downlink subframes which are 6 5 4 7 subframes subframes k earlier than uplink subframe 3 i.e. downlink subframes 7 8 9 6 or downlink subframes n k and M equals 4. For uplink downlink configuration 5 uplink subframe 2 M equals 9. For uplink downlink configuration 0 uplink subframe 2 M equals one and uplink subframe 3 M equals zero. Depending on the uplink downlink configuration one uplink subframe may be responsible for ACK NACK feedback for one or multiple downlink subframes. In certain situations even distribution between uplink subframe responsibility can be desired to reduce situations where one uplink subframe is responsible for ACK NACK feedback for a large number of downlink and special subframes. Table 3 illustrates the prior downlink subframe numbers for which the uplink subframe n provides ACK NACK feedback.

Referring back the parameters of Equation 2 Iis the lowest PRB index including at least one eCCE of ePDCCH resources in subframe n k. The parameter N 0 can either be cell specific or UE specific parameter or other specific parameter determined by a RS which indicates the ePDCCH RBs used for transmission of ePDCCH in downlink subframe n kfrom a system perspective or UE specific perspective where i is an integer increment of the summation. The ePDCCH RB parameter Ncan be signaled semi statically by high layer signaling such as RRC signaling or dynamically signaled in each downlink subframe through a special physical channel such as a physical control format indicator channel PCFICH which can be used to signal the length of the PDCCH or ePDCCH. Alternatively the ePDCCH RB parameter Ncan be or determined by the wireless device implicitly according to a system bandwidth as shown in Equation 3. Equation 3 Where Nis the number of PRB depending on the system downlink bandwidth configuration see . In an example the definitions of parameters used in Equation 2 can be the same as those used in Equation 1 if defined in Equation 1. In an example the parameters of Equations 1 and 2 can be varied e.g. removed which may limit PUCCH resource utilization. The reserved PUCCH resources can be minimized by proper setting of Nby reserving just enough PUCCH channels for ACK NACK feedback for legacy PDCCH and other control information. With a reduced number of reserved PUCCH resources more uplink RBs can be used for PUSCH transmission which can increase the uplink system throughput.

In another example using method 2 the uplink subframe n can include a PUCCH channel corresponding to a downlink assignment index DAI . If M 2 a different M associated with DAI and ePDCCH transmission occurs in subframe n kand n kseparately the PUCCH resource based on the PRB index in DAI 2 downlink subframe can be used for HARQ ACK feedback according to the method 2. For example PUCCH channel corresponding to DAI 1 can be transmitted in PUCCH resources for ePDCCH in subframe n kand PUCCH channel corresponding to DAI 2 can be transmitted in PUCCH resources for ePDCCH in subframe n k. A downlink assignment index DAI can be a field in the downlink resource grant signaled to a wireless device indicating how many subframes in a previous time window contained transmissions to that wireless device. DAI can be applicable in time domain duplex TDD mode and can enable the wireless device to determine whether wireless device has received all the downlink subframes or transport blocks for which the wireless device transmits a combined ACK NACK.

Another example provides a method for physical uplink control channel PUCCH resource mapping corresponding to an enhanced physical downlink control channel ePDCCH from a node as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium. The method includes the operation of mapping a PUCCH resource ncorresponding to an ePDCCH for PUCCH resource hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement HARQ ACK feedback wherein the PUCCH resource nis determined using a lowest PRB index including at least one enhanced control channel element eCCE of ePDCCH resources and a total number of eCCE in one physical resource block PRB as in block .

In another example the PUCCH resource ncan be determined by using at least one of starting physical resource block PRB index for an ePDCCH region a lowest PRB index including at least one enhanced control channel element eCCE of ePDCCH resources a total number of eCCE in one physical resource block PRB a starting PRB index for an ePDCCH region and a first eCCE index number in a lowest PRB used for transmission of the corresponding ePDCCH in a downlink subframe.

In a frequency division duplexing FDD example the PUCCH resource ncan be represented by where E is the total number of eCCE in one PRB Iis the lowest PRB index including at least one eCCE of ePDCCH resources Nis a starting PRB index for an ePDCCH region nis a first eCCE index number in a lowest PRB used for transmission of the corresponding ePDCCH in a downlink subframe where 0 n0 the starting PRB index Nfor an ePDCCH region can be greater than zero N 0 and the lowest PRB index Iincluding at least one eCCE of ePDCCH resources can be configured by radio resource control RRC signaling as cell specific parameter or a UE specific parameter and E can be a fixed parameter defined by a specification such as an LTE specification.

In another example the ePDCCH can use a localized ePDCCH transmission of the eCCE or a distributed ePDCCH transmission of the eCCE. The PUCCH resource ncan be a resource index for PUCCH formats or

Another example provides a method for generating hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement HARQ ACK feedback in physical uplink control channel PUCCH corresponding to an enhanced physical downlink control channel ePDCCH at a wireless device as shown in the flow chart in . The method may be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives non transitory computer readable storage medium or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. A non transitory computer readable storage medium can be a computer readable storage medium that does not include signal. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device may include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. The volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements may be a RAM EPROM flash drive optical drive magnetic hard drive solid state drive or other medium for storing electronic data. The node and wireless device may also include a transceiver module a counter module a processing module and or a clock module or timer module. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the various techniques described herein may use an application programming interface API reusable controls and the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s may be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code may be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules may be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.
