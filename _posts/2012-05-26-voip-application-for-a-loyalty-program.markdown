The present invention generally relates to voice over internet protocol communications. More specifically the present invention relates to a method and system for utilizing voice over Internet protocols with a loyalty program.

There various loyalty rewards programs which provide members a benefit for spending time or money for services of an enterprise. However most loyalty rewards programs require a multitude of personal information from members including a mobile phone number physical mailing address and or email address of the member. The loyalty rewards program uses this personal information to deliver coupons and offers to the member. The loyalty rewards program also sells the information to third parties. Further when the member wants to terminate the relationship the member is dependent on the loyalty rewards program to remove the member s information from their records. It is virtually impossible to completely unwind the relationship once it has been established. Essentially the member is dependent on the loyalty program to erase the member s personal information from the program.

A flow chart for a general method for providing voice based host services with CRM data without an end user s phone number is illustrated in . At block an end user member of the loyalty program accesses a VoIP application on a mobile communication device of the end user. The VoIP application utilizes the end user s loyalty account information for identification with a host device of the loyalty program without additional information from the end user. At block a VoIP request for a service from a loyalty program host is transmitted over a network from the mobile communication device of the end user. At block the VoIP request from the mobile communication device is received at a router server. At block an appropriate host device of the loyalty program is determined for the VoIP request received from the end user device. The host device is preferably associated with a customer service representative of the loyalty program that is associated with the level of the total value of the member to the loyalty program. If the member is a high level of total value to the loyalty program the customer service representative may be a senior vice president of client relations for the enterprise and the host device may be the mobile phone of the senior vice president. At block the VoIP request is routed to the appropriate host device of the loyalty program. At block the VoIP request is received at the appropriate host device along with the CRM information for the end user from a CRM database of a loyalty server of the loyalty program.

In the method of the CRM information is preferably transmitted to the host device with the VoIP request. Alternatively the VoIP request and the CRM information are transmitted separately to the host device. Alternatively the VoIP request comprises a CRM account number for the end user and the host device queries the CRM database with the CRM account number for the end user to obtain CRM information for the end user. At the end of the call the host device preferably logs the call and contact automatically as a CRM contact record in the CRM database.

In one preferred example a member of a loyalty program for a casino resort that is a high roller and of great total value to the casino downloads the VoIP application to the member s mobile phone . The VoIP application now resident on the mobile phone allows the high roller member to contact a customer representative of the loyalty program of the casino without having to disclose the phone number of the mobile phone . The high roller member provides his name and or loyalty program account number on the VoIP application so that a VoIP request transmitted to a server can map the VoIP application to the member s loyalty account at a CRM database for the casino. The high roller member accesses the VoIP application on the mobile phone which transmits a VoIP request to a router server . Essentially the high roller member is making a telephone call to his loyalty program representative without disclosing his phone number. In this case the representative is a vice president of client relations for the casino and the host device is a mobile phone of the vice president. The router server receives the VoIP request which includes an ID as discussed above which identifies the member. The router server maps the VoIP request as discussed above to the mobile phone of the vice president along with the account information for the high roller member. In this manner the vice president will know the total value of the high roller member to the casino during the conversation and the high roller will not need to disclose his telephone number.

If the VoIP application is deleted from the mobile communication device or the end user switches devices the VoIP application and the connection to the loyalty program will be terminated. This benefit allows the member to control the relationship with the loyalty rewards program. The member can terminate the relationship and never be concerned that personal information is still with the rewards program. Once the applicationID is terminated the relationship is ended until the member again takes affirmative steps to regenerate the relationship. Thus the present invention empowers the member instead of the loyalty program and the present invention allows the member to control his or her personal information.

From the foregoing it is believed that those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize the meritorious advancement of this invention and will readily understand that while the present invention has been described in association with a preferred embodiment thereof and other embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings numerous changes modification and substitutions of equivalents may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention which is intended to be unlimited by the foregoing except as may appear in the following appended claim.
