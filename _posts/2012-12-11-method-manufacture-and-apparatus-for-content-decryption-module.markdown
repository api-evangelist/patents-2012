The process then advances to block where the web application is employed to instruct a media stack of the user agent to play the encrypted media content. In some embodiments the web application may contain an autoplay attribute in which case the user agent parses the web application discovers the autoplay attribute and causes the media stack to autoplay the media content. In other embodiments there is no autoplay attribute for the media content and the web application instructs the media stack when to play media content. The media stack is instructed to play the media content in a time and manner that is in accordance with the web application. For example in some embodiments the web application instructs the media stack to play the media content when a play button is pressed by the user.

The process then moves to block where the license is sent from the web application to the media stack. The process then proceeds to block where the license is sent from the media stack to the CDM. The media stack and the CDM are distinct binaries from each other. The process then advances to block where encrypted data is sent from the media stack to the CDM. The encrypted data includes at least a portion of the encrypted media content. The process then moves to block where the CDM provides decrypted data by decrypting the encrypted data. The process then proceeds to a return block where other processing is resumed.

What happens to the decrypted data varies in various embodiments. In some embodiments the decrypted data is provided to the media stack for rendering. However the invention is not so limited and what happens to the decrypted data varies in different embodiments. For example in some embodiments the decrypted data is provided to a secure pipeline. These embodiments and others are within the scope and spirit of the invention.

The acts discussed above do not proceed in the exact order discussed above in every embodiment. In some embodiments the acts may happen in the order shown. In some of these embodiments the web application then gets the license at block and then the web application instructs the media stack to initiate playback and send the license to the media stack with block and happening in either order or at the same time .

In other embodiments the act at block may happen prior to the act at block . For example in some embodiments the web application instructs the media stack to initiate playback block . The media stack may then discover that the media content is encrypted. The media stack then provides an indication to the web application that the media content is protected. In response the web application gets the license at block . The web application then sends the license to the media stack at block . In some embodiments the web application may determine without notification of encountering anything in the file that it needs a license and may get the license at block after determining that a license is needed.

The media stack performs and or controls decoding of media content. In some embodiments the media stack is a set of connected media processing and rendering modules used for converting digital media data into human perceptible representations e.g. moving pictures and or sound . The media stack performs and or controls functions such as de multiplexing decryption and rendering in some embodiments. In some embodiments the media stack has substantially no other logic but just renders what it is fed and can therefore be used for all types of media playback applications. Certain functions such as decryption are not performed directly by the media stack itself but by the CDM which is a separate module that performs certain functions such as decryption under the control of the media stack.

The web application instructs the media stack to play back media content. In some embodiments the web application includes computer executable code that implements substantially all logic required to play back media in a particular context includes user interface logic subtitle control information control of the acquisition of content control data and the like but not processing and rendering. The processing decryption and rendering are instead performed by the media stack and or by separate modules under the control of the media stack including the CDM. In some embodiments the rendering is performed by a part of the browser other than the media stack. In other embodiments the rendering is performed by another part hardware or software of the client. Together the media stack and the web application both reside in the client and operate as a client media player. The media stack and the web application are distinct programs or binaries or libraries or scripts etc. where the media stack can be re used. The media stack is part of an application framework together with other modules that implement user input graphics output network I O etc. The application framework exposes standard abstract interfaces for these functions to the web application.

This particular separation between media stack as part of the application framework and web application is useful because the media stack implementation is typically specific to the type of computer hardware platform it executes on and therefore is implemented in a way that is strongly connected to the operating system. The same holds for user input graphics output network I O etc. In some embodiments the media stack is specific to a particular type of content protection. The web application however can be the same across many different computer platforms when the underlying application framework abstracts access to user input network graphics media stack etc.

A content encryption key may be generated employing any of a number of encryption decryption symmetric mechanisms including but not limited to Advanced Encryption Standard AES RSA RC6 IDEA DES RC2 RC5 Skipjack and any other symmetric encryption algorithm. Moreover such encryption algorithms may use where appropriate cipher block chaining mode cipher feedback mode CBC cipher text stealing CTS CFB OFB counter mode and or any other block mode. In some embodiments content encryption keys are generated employing an at least 128 bit AES encryption decryption algorithm. However content encryption key generation is not limited to symmetric key mechanisms and asymmetric key mechanisms may also be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. Typically where the content encryption key is a symmetric encryption key such content encryption keys are also referred to as decryption keys as the same key may be used to both encrypt and to decrypt the content.

At block the web application may get the license in a number of different ways in different embodiments. In some embodiments the web application gets the license via communication with a server. In some embodiments the license may be found locally or on a local network. In some embodiments the license is acquired in accordance with a digital right management DRM scheme or other content protection system. In other embodiments the license could be stored in the web application. The web application is configurable to different types of content protection through the same framework. The web application defines a protocol or process and standardizes the interfaces so that the process could be configured to work with any of a variety of like underlying sort of technologies but the interface is the same regardless of the content protection system used.

At block the web application may get the key in communication with a server or the like in some embodiments but the license acquisition process is performed by the web application the media stack is not involved in the license acquisition process at all although the media stack and or the CDM may well be involved in license exchange and processing including the license request process.

Since the license acquisition occurs not in the media stack but in the web application the web application has control over the error handling for the license acquisition and the web application can handle error conditions and the like.

The process of acquiring a license can be accomplished multiple times during a single playback session e.g. for key rotation.

In some embodiments process may be employed to play encrypted media content accessed via an HTML media element in HTML5 or future versions of HTML that employ HTML media element tags such as and future HTML media elements.

In additional to decryption in various embodiments the CDM may also perform such functions as DRM content protection license exchange or processing including e.g. license request generation decoding de multiplexing and or the like. In some embodiments the CDM performs decoding for codecs not supported by the browser. While the media stack generally performs rendering in many embodiments in some embodiments the CDM is employed to perform secure rendering.

In terms of DRM and or content protection in some embodiments the CDM may protect the buffers and protect the decryption key through software methods. In some embodiments the CDM has a secret key that the CDM uses to decrypt the license and obtain the content key and the CDM protects the CDM s secret key. In some embodiments the CDM employs the content key to decrypt the corresponding media. In some embodiments the CDM must also protect the content key once the CDM has decrypted the content key from the license. In some embodiments the CDM also protects the compressed decrypted frames. In some embodiments the memory is scrambled such that the decrypted but compressed frames are not available in memory at any time. In some embodiments the decompressed frames may also be protected. In some embodiments the CDM may also protect and or enforce other license provisions such as the length of time the license allows particular video content to be viewed. In some embodiments the CDM determines when the license has expired and that a new license is needed when the license has expired.

The media stack controls various functions of the CDM such as when to decrypt and decode when to render if the CDM performs rendering when to generate a license request and the like. However in some embodiments the CDM may also perform DRM and or content protection functions that are not necessarily directly controlled or initiated by the media stack such as those DRM and or content protection functions discussed in the previous paragraph.

In some embodiments the CDM performs decryption but not decoding. In some of these embodiments the media stack may provide encrypted data to the CDM the CDM decrypts the media and provides the decrypted media to the media stack and the media stack then performs decoding on the decrypted media. In other embodiments as previously discussed the CDM performs both decryption and decoding. In some embodiments after the media stack sends the CDM encrypted media the CDM decrypts and decodes the encrypted media and then sends the decrypted media to secure hardware e.g. a secure surface rather than returning the decrypted media to the media stack. In some embodiments the CDM uses a secure pipeline for decryption decoding and or rendering.

The CDM is a separate binary from the browser. This allows browsers to be provided that do not include decryption DRM license exchange and or content protection as part of the browser. Also the browser may be entirely open source code while having the decryption DRM content protection license exchange license request generation functions in a separate binary the CDM that is closed source code. The CDM may perform obfuscation not present in the open source browser. The CDM can use cryptography tricks that the browser does not have. It also allows a vendor to allow some solutions to be added after market . As a separate binary the CDM can be disabled by the user isolated for security purposes and or isolated from the user s system for privacy purposes. Also if the CDM crashes the CDM crash may not crash the renderer or the browser processes.

In some embodiments the CDM is a browser plug in. In some embodiments the CDM is a pluggable extension. In some embodiments the CDM may employ hooks i.e. to load a .DLL .SO extensions and or the like. In these embodiments these application programming interfaces APIs may allow the media stack to use third party and or separately downloaded module s .so .dll COM interface class system registered entity to perform decryption decoding secure rendering content protection and or other DRM capabilities. In some embodiments the browser has extension interfaces so that the code for the CDM can be registered to be called at certain times such as frame decryption.

In some embodiments the CDM is sandboxed. In some embodiments the CDM is sandboxed but can perform particular unsandboxed operations via a special channel. In some embodiments the CDM is sandboxed but can perform particular unsandboxed operations via a broker.

Content protection can involve accessing the system in ways web content usually should not need which could lead to system vulnerabilities. If the CDM is sandboxed these system vulnerabilities can be prevented. Also sandboxing can provide privacy protection so that the CDM cannot grab personal identifiable information or the like. By employing a sandboxed CDM that is a separate binary from the browser secure decryption and or DRM may be performed without polluting the browser or using platform capabilities platform independent decryption DRM may be performed both in the logical OS independent and architecture binary sense and content protection decryption and or the like can be separate from the browser and the web application all while the browser handles playback.

Sandboxing only allows code execution that cannot make persistent changes to the computer and sandboxed code execution cannot access information that is confidential. With sandboxing code that is running cannot make changes to the system and no matter what it does does not have access to change the system. A sandboxed program typically cannot run commands that are not authorized and might also be able to change the system but only via strict APIs the sandboxed code is unable create modify or delete a file using normal system calls. The sandboxed code can only change the system through an API and the sandboxing entity can decide which kinds of accesses to allow.

In some embodiments the CDM may be a sandboxed browser plug in and implemented as a Pepper Pepper Plugin API PPAPI plug in. Traditionally plug ins including Pepper are used to display content on the page. However in some embodiments Pepper is just used as a framework to execute code separate from the web browser within a sandbox.

In some embodiments the CDM is not sandboxed and the CDM can write out to a secure pipeline. In some embodiments the CDM is not sandboxed and it does decryption and decoding in a secure pipeline. Secure pipelines may also be used when the CDM is sandboxed .

In other embodiments the CDM may be a browser plug in implemented for example in Netscape Plugin API NPAPI or ActiveX. In some embodiments the CDM is a pluggable extension to the browser but is not a browser plug in. In some embodiments the CDM is an extension or a browser add on. However the plug in need not be pluggable or extensible in all embodiments.

In some embodiments the CDM is downloaded separately from the browser e.g. in the background when necessary or when the user modifies a setting . In other embodiments the CDM is present but disabled until the user takes some particular action.

In some embodiments the browser may be loaded as an .exe file with the CDM loaded as a .dll file such as CDM.DLL where the .exe and .dll files are required to be run together and the browser can call CDM.DLL when needed. In some embodiments the CDM.DLL file is sandboxed when it is loaded.

After a start block the process proceeds to block where the web application sends a request for a license request to the media stack. The process then moves to block where the media stack sends the request for a license request to the CDM.

The process then advances to block where the CDM sends a license request to the media stack. In some embodiments the license request must come from the CDM because in these embodiments for security purposes the license server requires a signature that only the CDM can provide in order to provide the license. The process then proceeds to block where the media stack sends the license request to the web application. The process then proceeds to a return block where other processing is resumed.

Client device includes application content decryption module CDM platform and browser . Browser includes media stack and network stack Net .

CDM performs decryption of media content in communication with media stack . Application is a media playback control application such as the web application discussed with regard to above.

As discussed above media stack performs decoding of media content in conjunction with CDM which performs the actual decoding in some embodiments . In some embodiments media stack is a set of connected media processing and rendering modules used for converting digital media data into human perceptible representations e.g. moving pictures and or sound . Media stack performs functions such as de multiplexing decoding and rendering in some embodiments in conjunction with CDM in some embodiments . In some embodiments media stack has substantially no other logic but just renders what it is fed and can therefore be used for all types of media playback applications in an interchangeable fashion.

Application instructs media stack to playback media content. In some embodiments application includes computer executable code that implements substantially all of the logic required to play back media in a particular context including user interface logic subtitle control information control of the acquisition of keys and or the like but not processing and rendering. The processing and rendering is instead performed by media stack . In some embodiments the rendering is performed by a part of browser other than media stack . Together media stack and application both reside in client device and operate as a client media player. Media stack and application are distinct programs or binaries or libraries etc. where media stack can be re used. As discussed above application may be a web application for playback of media using the HTML media elements identified in HTML5 by HTML media tags such as and where the web application includes a scripting language e.g. JavaScript and HTML.

In some embodiments when application acquires a license it does so in communication with one or more servers. In some embodiments web server may handle requests or send directly to license server . In some embodiments application may communicate directly with license server .

In some embodiments media stack may acquire media content specified by application via network stack where network stack acquires the media content from CDN .

The process then advances to block where the web application instructs the media stack of the client browser to initiate playback of the media content. The process then proceeds to block where the media stack starts to procure the media content that the media stack was instructed to play back e.g. through file reading or progressive or adaptive streaming .

The process then advances to block where the media stack fires an event to the web application where the event indicates that a license is needed to begin or continue playback of the media content. The process then proceeds to block where the license request process occurs. In one embodiment the process at block occurs substantially as process of .

The process then moves to block where the web application gets the license. As discussed in greater detail above and below the web application may get the license in a variety of different ways in different embodiments. For example in some embodiments the application acquires the license via communication with one or more servers. In other embodiments the license could be stored in the application. The process then advances to block where the web application sends the license to the media stack or to hardware.

The process then proceeds to block where the media stack receives the license. The process then advances to block where the media stack sends the license to the CDM. The process then moves to block where the media stack sends encrypted data to the CDM. The encrypted data may be accompanied by parameters including which license the encrypted data is associated with. The process then proceeds to block where the encrypted data is decrypted and decoded by the CDM. In some embodiments the media content is first decrypted and then decoded and in other embodiments the media content is first decoded then decrypted. In some embodiments the encrypted media content it sent from the media stack to the CDM one frame at a time and the CDM decrypts and decodes the media content one frame at a time. In some embodiments the CDM performs the decryption but not the decoding and the decoding is instead performed by the media stack after the decrypted media is sent back to the media stack.

The process then advances to block where the CDM sends the decrypted and decoded media content back to the media stack and the media content is rendered by the media stack. In some embodiments the media stack renders media content. In other embodiments another part of the browser renders the media content. The processing then proceeds to a return block where other processing is resumed.

Many variations to the exact process flow illustrated in are within the scope and spirit of the invention. For example in some embodiments the web application may determine that the media is encrypted. Accordingly rather than the web application instructing the media stack to initiate playback right away in this case the web application can instead get the license and after the web application gets the license the web application can instruct the media stack to initiate playback along with sending the media stack the data that includes the license. In some embodiments the media tags may specify that the media is encrypted. As previously discussed the steps may happen in a different order than shown in for example the step of block may occur earlier or later than shown as previously discussed. Further in some embodiments the application may determine without notification that a license is needed rather than having to encounter something in the file before determining that a license is needed.

In some embodiments such as a key rotation scheme the media stack can fire an event each time a new key is needed and the application can provide the new key to the media stack.

Process may be applied to local content to content that is downloaded and then played and or to streaming content. Process is not specific to any particular form of content protection but may be applied to various forms of DRM and other forms of content protection in different embodiments. Process can support a wide range of control system types including traditional DRM systems conditional access systems simple key establishment without the need for DRM servers and key distribution systems based on DRM systems.

In some embodiments process may be used for viewing commercial content including commercial content protected by a content protection mechanism such as DRM where the commercial content may include movies or the like. In some embodiments the media may be accessed via a webpage employing HTML5 or a future version of HTML that also supports media tags where the media content is accessed in an HTML media tag such as or . The media content which is protected by some sort of content protection such as encryption DRM and or the like can be accessed in a browser with an HTML media tag with the media accessible controllable and configurable by the web application where the media content can be streamed to the browser downloaded provided by the application or local. In some embodiments the web application provides application level flexibility to implement the authorization exchange and all of the HTML5 security mechanisms may be used for network transactions.

In some embodiments one attribute authorizationData and one event authorizationNeeded is added to the HTML5 media elements as follows. In some of these embodiments the design adds one new attribute to media elements named authorizationData. In some embodiments the purpose of this attribute is to provide the CDM with the necessary information to initialize itself and enable playback of the requested content e.g. a decryption key . In some embodiments authorizationData may be a method that provides the data to the media element. The attribute authorizationData and the event authorizationNeeded may have different names in different embodiments. For example in they are referred to as addKey as a called function rather than an attribute and needkey respectively.

The authorizationNeeded event fires when the media stack underneath the media element discovers the need for fresh authorization data to start or continue playback. This event is accompanied by one or more blobs of data generated by the media stack that is potentially opaque to the application. The format of the data may be dependent on the content control mechanism s in the CDM and or content format.

The authorizationNeeded event is an embodiment of the event fired at block of process . In some embodiments the authorizationNeeded event also contains supplemental data that is specific to the content control mechanism and or content. The supplemental data can be opaque to the application it only needs to be understood by the entity that creates the license data which could be a network service in some embodiments.

The web application uses the information mentioned above to procure the required content control data either through an application specific mechanism or through a content control specific mechanism . This could happen through in client processing querying e.g. a password retrieval from storage or a network request to a service. The authorizationNeeded event can fire multiple times during a single playback session e.g. for key rotation.

The acquired content control data is provided to the media element via the authorizationData attribute. Once the data is present and correctly verified by the media stack playout starts. In order to avoid playout delays due to latencies incurred when acquiring content control data existing preload mechanisms can be used.

In some embodiments the authorizationNeeded event contains an array of the following tuple type and data where type is an identifier of content control mechanism and data is a byte array containing contents dependent on content control mechanism to enable application to acquire authorization data. In some embodiments the authorizationData attribute includes a byte array in which the contents are dependent on content control mechanism which enables the media stack to play content and or content data format.

In one possible embodiment of an application of the authorization data acquisition mechanism content is encrypted using a content key and a secure key distribution system stores the key. In some embodiments the media stack contains client code of this secure key distribution system though a pluggable mechanism or platform capabilities in some embodiments and the content provider runs a key distribution service as a counterpart.

In some of these embodiments the content control system uses a challenge data structure generated on the client and a license data structure generated on the server using the content key and the client public key. The challenge data structure typically contains information about the content to be played for retrieval of the correct key and information about the client CDM client ID client type public key for encryption of the content key for transport .

In these embodiments the media stack detects that the content is encrypted and can be decrypted using the secure key distribution system s client CDM. The content key is acquired through a network transaction. Since the application has not yet set the authorizationData attribute of the media element to a valid license data structure the media stack generates a challenge data structure and serializes it into a byte stream.

In these embodiments the authorizationNeeded event gets the following two attributes 1 type and 2 data and fires.

In these embodiments the application catches the event using a handler for this event. In the handler the web application generates a request to the streaming service s license server using an existing authentication mechanism e.g. domain cookie to authorize the request on the server and the opaque data generated by the CDM. In some embodiments the content control mechanism may choose to invalidate the authorization data after a certain number of uses therefore disallowing replay of previously issued authorization data and in consequence enforcing a requirement of fresh authorization for each playback.

In these embodiments authorization depends on the streaming service s business rules. At the minimum licenses could be handed out to everyone. In a service like this the content still cannot be copied and giving out rights to play back can be stopped at any time e.g. when the service s distribution rights for this content end . Other services may require customer authentication and even others may impose restrictions on number of devices and concurrent usage.

In these embodiments if authorization is successful the license server may use the content identification data in the challenge data structure to retrieve the content key for the content to be played from its database and use the client key to generate a license data structure which is handed back to the application in the response. The application installs the opaque license data into the authorizationData attribute of the media element and playout starts after successful verification of the license data and extraction or derivation of the content key from the license data by the media stack. In some embodiments the CDM is responsible for the security of the decrypted content the security of the content key the security of the client CDM keys that can be used to decrypt license data and secure disposal of the content key after playback has ended. In some embodiments the opaque license data contains all of the necessary information to play all streams of the content in question that are authorized to the requesting user on the target device. For example if different streams of some particular content are encrypted with different keys the license contains all of the keys and the necessary information to associate it with the correct streams.

In some of these embodiments the system can be extended to allow offline playback without changing the media stack implementation of the content control system e.g. by retrieving the license from storage.

In these embodiments a simple offline playback system allows the user to pin content to the client device while the device is connected. The content data one embodiment thereof e.g. at appropriate bitrate and quality for the target device is downloaded from the server in its entirety and stored in local storage. The application uses a media element to initiate preload of playback for the content data in local storage which triggers the authorization data retrieval mechanism. The authorization data is retrieved by the application as in the streaming use case but not installed in the authorizationData attribute yet. It is cached in local storage until offline playback is initiated.

In these embodiments if required for management of the stored authorization data the content protection system can support the transmission of additional information on top of the opaque authorization data blob to the web application e.g. content ID expiration date etc. e.g. through the network protocol that also serves to transmit the authorizationData blob. This mechanism can be proprietary to the content protection system in some embodiments.

In these embodiments when playback is initiated the application retrieves the authorization data from its internal storage and installs it in the media element allowing playout to proceed.

Returning to as discussed above the event authorizationNeeded and the attribute authorizationData are instead replaced by the event needkey and the function addKey respectively. Application may use Get Key to acquire a key from a server which may in turn respond with an encrypted key via Key from the server to application . The key may be provided from application to media stack via addKey and from media stack to CDM via SetKey.

In some embodiments canPlayType is extended to provide basic information about content control systems supported by the browser.

Media stack may provide an encrypted frame for CDM to decrypt via Decrypt Frame. CDM then decrypts the encrypted frame and provides the decrypted frame back to media stack via Frame.

In some embodiments a generateKeyRequest function may be employed from Application to media stack . A Key Request may be sent from media stack to application in response to the generateKeyRequest function.

The above specification examples and data provide a description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention. Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention the invention also resides in the claims hereinafter appended.
