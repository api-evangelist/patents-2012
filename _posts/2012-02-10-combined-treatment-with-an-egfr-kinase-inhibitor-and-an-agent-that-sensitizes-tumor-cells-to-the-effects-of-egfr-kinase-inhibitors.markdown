The present invention is directed to compositions and methods for treating cancer patients. Cancer is a generic name for a wide range of cellular malignancies characterized by unregulated growth lack of differentiation and the ability to invade local tissues and metastasize. These neoplastic malignancies affect with various degrees of prevalence every tissue and organ in the body.

A multitude of therapeutic agents have been developed over the past few decades for the treatment of various types of cancer. The most commonly used types of anticancer agents include DNA alkylating agents e.g. cyclophosphamide ifosfamide antimetabolites e.g. methotrexate a folate antagonist and 5 fluorouracil a pyrimidine antagonist microtubule disrupters e.g. vincristine vinblastine paclitaxel DNA intercalators e.g. doxorubicin daunomycin cisplatin and hormone therapy e.g. tamoxifen flutamide . More recently gene targeted therapies such as protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors e.g. imatinib the EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib have increasingly been used in cancer therapy.

The epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR family comprises four closely related receptors HER1 EGFR HER2 HER3 and HER4 involved in cellular responses such as differentiation and proliferation. Over expression of the EGFR kinase or its ligand TGF alpha is frequently associated with many cancers including breast lung colorectal ovarian renal cell bladder head and neck cancers glioblastomas and astrocytomas and is believed to contribute to the malignant growth of these tumors. A specific deletion mutation in the EGFR gene EGFRvIII has also been found to increase cellular tumorigenicity. Activation of EGFR stimulated signaling pathways promote multiple processes that are potentially cancer promoting e.g. proliferation angiogenesis cell motility and invasion decreased apoptosis and induction of drug resistance. Increased HER1 EGFR expression is frequently linked to advanced disease metastases and poor prognosis. For example in NSCLC and gastric cancer increased HER1 EGFR expression has been shown to correlate with a high metastatic rate poor tumor differentiation and increased tumor proliferation.

Mutations which activate the receptor s intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and or increase downstream signaling have been observed in NSCLC and glioblastoma. However the role of mutations as a principle mechanism in conferring sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors for example erlotinib TARCEVA or gefitinib IRESSA has been controversial. Recently a mutant form of the full length EGF receptor has been reported to predict responsiveness to the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib Paez J. G. et al. 2004 Science 304 1497 1500 Lynch T. J. et al. 2004 N. Engl. J. Med. 350 2129 2139 . Cell culture studies have shown that cell lines which express the mutant form of the EGF receptor i.e. H3255 were more sensitive to growth inhibition by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib and that much higher concentrations of gefitinib was required to inhibit the tumor cell lines expressing wild type EGF receptor. These observations suggests that specific mutant forms of the EGF receptor may reflect a greater sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors but do not identify a completely non responsive phenotype.

The development for use as anti tumor agents of compounds that directly inhibit the kinase activity of the EGFR as well as antibodies that reduce EGFR kinase activity by blocking EGFR activation are areas of intense research effort de Bono J. S. and Rowinsky E. K. 2002 Trends in Mol. Medicine 8 S19 S26 Dancey J. and Sausville E. A. 2003 Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 2 92 313 . Several studies have demonstrated disclosed or suggested that some EGFR kinase inhibitors might improve tumor cell or neoplasia killing when used in combination with certain other anti cancer or chemotherapeutic agents or treatments e.g. Herbst R. S. et al. 2001 Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 1 719 732 Solomon B. et al 2003 Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 55 713 723 Krishnan S. et al. 2003 Frontiers in Bioscience 8 e1 13 Grunwald V. and Hidalgo M. 2003 J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 95 851 867 Seymour L. 2003 Current Opin. Investig.

Drug Discovery 2 92 313 Ciardiello F. et al. 2000 Clin. Cancer Res. 6 2053 2063 and Patent Publication No US 2003 0157104 .

Erlotinib e.g. erlotinib HCl also known as TARCEVA or OSI 774 is an orally available inhibitor of EGFR kinase. In vitro erlotinib has demonstrated substantial inhibitory activity against EGFR kinase in a number of human tumor cell lines including colorectal and breast cancer Moyer J. D. et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4838 and preclinical evaluation has demonstrated activity against a number of EGFR expressing human tumor xenografts Pollack V. A. et al 1999 J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 291 739 . More recently erlotinib has demonstrated promising activity in phase I and II trials in a number of indications including head and neck cancer Soulieres D. et al. 2004 J. Clin. Oncol. 22 77 NSCLC Perez Soler R et al. 2001 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 20 310a abstract 1235 CRC Oza M. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 196a abstract 785 and MBC Winer E. et al. 2002 Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 76 5115a abstract 445 . In a phase III trial erlotinib monotherapy significantly prolonged survival delayed disease progression and delayed worsening of lung cancer related symptoms in patients with advanced treatment refractory NSCLC Shepherd F. et al. 2005 N. Engl. J. Med. 353 2 123 132 . While most of the clinical trial data for erlotinib relate to its use in NSCLC preliminary results from phase I II studies have demonstrated promising activity for erlotinib and capecitabine erlotinib combination therapy in patients with wide range of human solid tumor types including CRC Oza M. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 196a abstract 785 and MBC Jones R. J. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 45a abstract 180 . In November 2004 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved TARCEVA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. TARCEVA is the only drug in the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR class to demonstrate in a Phase III clinical trial an increase in survival in advanced NSCLC patients.

An anti neoplastic drug would ideally kill cancer cells selectively with a wide therapeutic index relative to its toxicity towards non malignant cells. It would also retain its efficacy against malignant cells even after prolonged exposure to the drug. Unfortunately none of the current chemotherapies possess such an ideal profile. Instead most possess very narrow therapeutic indexes. Furthermore cancerous cells exposed to slightly sub lethal concentrations of a chemotherapeutic agent will very often develop resistance to such an agent and quite often cross resistance to several other antineoplastic agents as well. Additionally for any given cancer type one frequently cannot predict which patient is likely to respond to a particular treatment even with newer gene targeted therapies such as EGFR kinase inhibitors thus necessitating considerable trial and error often at considerable risk and discomfort to the patient in order to find the most effective therapy.

Thus there is a need for more efficacious treatment for neoplasia and other proliferative disorders and for more effective means for determining which tumors will respond to which treatment. Strategies for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of existing drugs have involved changes in the schedule for their administration and also their use in combination with other anticancer or biochemical modulating agents. Combination therapy is well known as a method that can result in greater efficacy and diminished side effects relative to the use of the therapeutically relevant dose of each agent alone. In some cases the efficacy of the drug combination is additive the efficacy of the combination is approximately equal to the sum of the effects of each drug alone but in other cases the effect is synergistic the efficacy of the combination is greater than the sum of the effects of each drug given alone .

Target specific therapeutic approaches such as erlotinib are generally associated with reduced toxicity compared with conventional cytotoxic agents and therefore lend themselves to use in combination regimens. Promising results have been observed in phase I II studies of erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab Mininberg E. D. et al. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 627a abstract 2521 and gemcitabine Dragovich T. 2003 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 223a abstract 895 . Recent data in NSCLC phase III trials have shown that first line erlotinib or gefitinib in combination with standard chemotherapy did not improve survival Gatzemeier U. 2004 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 23 617 Abstract 7010 Herbst R. S. 2004 Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 23 617 Abstract 7011 Giaccone G. et al. 2004 J. Clin. Oncol. 22 777 Herbst R. et al. 2004 J. Clin. Oncol. 22 785 . However pancreatic cancer phase III trials have shown that first line erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine did improve survival OSI Pharmaceuticals Genentech Roche Pharmaceuticals Press Release Sep. 20 2004 .

Activation of EGFR triggers multiple cascades of signal transduction pathways. EGFR contains at least six autophosphorylation sites that serve as docking nodes for a multitude of intracellular signaling molecules including adapter proteins and other enzymes. Therefore rather than regulating a single linear pathway activation of EGFR modulates entire networks of cellular signal transduction cascades. These signals affect both cell cycle progression proliferation and apoptosis. Two signal transduction cascades that lie downstream of EGFR are the MAPK mitogen activated protein kinase and Akt pathways. In the MAPK pathway EGFR activates the small GTP binding protein Ras to transfer cell growth signals through the Raf MEK ERK cascade culminating in the regulation of transcription factors important for cell cycle progression.

EGFR can activate PI3K through homodimers or heterodimers with HER3 to initiate signals through the PDK1 Akt pathway. Akt can positively regulate anti apoptotic factors within the cell to promote cell survival. In addition Akt can activate the protein kinase mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin to promote cell growth and proliferation. mTOR is a major regulator of cell growth and proliferation in response to both growth factors and cellular nutrients. It is a key regulator of the rate limiting step for translation of mRNA into protein the binding of the ribosome to mRNA. Here mTOR directly modulates the activities of a number of downstream signaling proteins involved in protein synthesis. Two substrates that are directly phosphorylated by mTOR include 4EBP1 and p70S6K. 4EBP1 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to eIF4E blocking proper organization of the ribosome initiation complex. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR disrupts interactions with eIF4E liberating eIF4E for translation. mTOR also directly phosphorylates and activates p70S6K which in turn phosphorylates S6 ribosomal protein leading to enhanced mRNA translation.

mTOR exists in at least 2 distinct multiprotein complexes described as raptor mTOR complex mTORC1 and rictor mTOR complex mTORC2 in mammalian cells sometimes referred to as just TORC1 and TORC2 . mTORC1 is composed of mTOR G L and raptor proteins and it binds to FKBP12 rapamycin. mTORC1 is a rapamycin sensitive complex as its kinase activity is inhibited by FKB12 rapamycin in vitro. How FKBP12 rapamycin inhibits mTOR kinase activity is poorly understood. The drug rapamycin does not displace G L or raptor from mTOR but does strongly destabilize the raptor mTOR interaction. Extensive work with rapamycin indicates that mTORC1 complex positively regulates cell growth. The raptor branch of the mTOR pathway modulates number of processes including mRNA translation ribosome biogenesis nutrient metabolism and autophagy. The two mammalian proteins S6 Kinase 1 S6K1 and 4E BP1 which are linked to protein synthesis are downstream targets of mTORC1. mTORC1 has been shown to phosphorylates S6K1 at T389 and is inhibited by FKBP12 rapamycin in vitro and by rapamycin in vivo. mTORC1 can also phosphorylate 4E BP1 at T37 46 in vitro and in vivo.

mTORC2 is composed of mTOR G L and rictor proteins and it does not bind to FKBP12 rapamycin complex. mTORC2 is a rapamycin insensitive complex as its kinase activity is not inhibited by FKBP12 rapamycin complex in vitro. It is unclear why FKBP12 rapamycin complex does not bind the rictor containing mTORC2 complex. Rictor or an unidentified component of the complex may block or occupy the FKBP12 rapamycin complex binding site or allosterically destroy the FKBP12 rapamycin complex binding pocket. It has been discovered recently that mTORC2 is a hydrophobic motif kinase for Akt PKB and plays an important role in Akt PKB activation. mTORC2 has been shown to phosphorylate PKB Akt at S473 in vitro and in vivo. Akt PKB is a key component of insulin PI3K signaling pathway and modulates cell survival and proliferation through downstream substrates such as the FOXO class of transcription factors and p53 regulator mdm2. In addition mTORC2 regulates the actin cytoskeleton through unknown mechanisms that involve PKCa and Rho. mTORC2 can also phosphorylate 4E BP1 in vitro and in vivo.

Deregulation of mTOR pathway is emerging as a common theme in diverse human diseases and as a consequence drugs that target mTOR have therapeutic values. The diseases most clearly associated with deregulation of mTORC1 are tuberous sclerosis complex TSC and Lymphangioleiomyomatosis LAM both of which are cause by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressors. Patients with TSC develop benign tumors that when present in brain however can cause seizures mental retardation and death. LAM is a serious lung disease. Inhibition of mTORC1 may help patients with Peutz Jeghers cancer prone syndrome caused by LKB1 mutation.

mTORC1 may also have role in the genesis of sporadic cancers. Inactivation of several tumor suppressors in particular PTEN p53 VHL and NF1 has been linked to mTORC1 activation. Rapamycin and its analogues eg CCI 779 RAD001 and AP23573 inhibit TORC1 and have shown moderate anti cancer activity in phase II clinical trials. However due to the negative signal from S6K1 to the insulin PI3K Akt pathway it is important to note that inhibitors of mTORC1 like rapalogs can activate PKB Akt. If this effect persists with chronic rapamycin treatment it may provide cancer cells with an increased survival signal that may be clinically undesirable. The PI3K Akt pathway is activated in many cancers. Activated Akt regulates cell survival cell proliferation and metabolism by phosphorylating proteins such as BAD FOXO NF B p21 p27 GSK3 and others. AKT might also promote cell growth by phosphorylating TSC2. AKT activation probably promotes cellular transformation and resistance to apoptosis by collectively promoting growth proliferation and survival while inhibiting apoptotic pathways. An inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 should be beneficial for treatment of tumors with elevated AKT phosphorylation and should down regulate cell growth cell survival and cell proliferation.

Recent reports have shown that the sensitivity of cell lines to growth inhibition by EGFR inhibitors is dependent on the down regulation of the PI3K Akt pathway. There can be extensive overlap in signaling where an EGFR signaling pathway can also be regulated by several other receptor tyrosine kinases. This potential for multiple inputs in EGFR signaling pathways suggests that inhibiting EGFR alone may not allow for growth inhibition of all tumor cells and highlights the potential for multi point intervention utilizing combinations of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Combining EGFR inhibitors with inhibitors of IGF1 R has shown success in some preclinical models. In addition to multiple inputs in growth factor signaling specific mutations or protein deletions in downstream signaling pathways can affect sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. For example the MDA 468 breast tumor cell line contains a deletion of PTEN and endogenous inhibitor of PI3K signaling. Reconstitution of PTEN in these cells enhances their sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Such studies have suggested that combining EGFR inhibitors with agents such as mTOR inhibitors that antagonize downstream signaling pathways may permit enhanced sensitization in cell lines that either have redundancy in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling or contain specific mutations in downstream signaling.

Many inhibitors of mTOR have been identified and several are in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer e.g. RAD001 also known as Everolimus Novartis CCI 779 also known as Temsirolimus Wyeth AP23573 Ariad Pharmaceuticals and KU 0059475 Kudus Pharmaceuticals Mita M. M. et al. 2003 Cancer Biology Therapy 2 4 Suppl. 1 S169 S177 . The potential effectiveness of combinations of such mTOR inhibitors with other anti cancer agents has also been suggested and is being tested in clinical trials Adjei A. and Hidalgo M. 2005 J. Clin. Oncol. 23 5386 5403 . Such combinations include combinations of mTOR inhibitors with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors Sawyers C. 2003 Cancer Cell 4 343 348 Gemmill R. M. et al. 2005 Br. J.

Despite the advances in treatment described above there remains a critical need for improved treatments for many human cancers. The invention described herein provides new anti cancer combination therapies that are an improvement on the efficacy of either EGFR kinase inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors when administered alone. In particular the present invention is directed to methods of combined treatment of breast colon NSCL or pancreatic cancer with an epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor that sensitizes tumor cells of these cancers to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors a result which has not previously been reported in the medical literature.

The present invention provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors wherein said agent is an mTOR inhibitor with or without additional agents or treatments such as other anti cancer drugs or radiation therapy.

The present invention also provides a method for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors wherein said agent is an mTOR inhibitor that binds to and directly inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases.

The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor that binds to and directly inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

A preferred example of an EGFR kinase inhibitor that can be used in this invention is the compound erlotinib HCl also known as TARCEVA .

The term cancer in an animal refers to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer causing cells such as uncontrolled proliferation immortality metastatic potential rapid growth and proliferation rate and certain characteristic morphological features. Often cancer cells will be in the form of a tumor but such cells may exist alone within an animal or may circulate in the blood stream as independent cells such as leukemic cells.

 Cell growth as used herein for example in the context of tumor cell growth unless otherwise indicated is used as commonly used in oncology where the term is principally associated with growth in cell numbers which occurs by means of cell reproduction i.e. proliferation when the rate the latter is greater than the rate of cell death e.g. by apoptosis or necrosis to produce an increase in the size of a population of cells although a small component of that growth may in certain circumstances be due also to an increase in cell size or cytoplasmic volume of individual cells. An agent that inhibits cell growth can thus do so by either inhibiting proliferation or stimulating cell death or both such that the equilibrium between these two opposing processes is altered.

 Tumor growth or tumor metastases growth as used herein unless otherwise indicated is used as commonly used in oncology where the term is principally associated with an increased mass or volume of the tumor or tumor metastases primarily as a result of tumor cell growth.

 Abnormal cell growth as used herein unless otherwise indicated refers to cell growth that is independent of normal regulatory mechanisms e.g. loss of contact inhibition . This includes the abnormal growth of 1 tumor cells tumors that proliferate by expressing a mutated tyrosine kinase or over expression of a receptor tyrosine kinase 2 benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant tyrosine kinase activation occurs 4 any tumors that proliferate by receptor tyrosine kinases 5 any tumors that proliferate by aberrant serine threonine kinase activation and 6 benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant serine threonine kinase activation occurs.

The term treating as used herein unless otherwise indicated means reversing alleviating inhibiting the progress of or preventing either partially or completely the growth of tumors tumor metastases or other cancer causing or neoplastic cells in a patient. The term treatment as used herein unless otherwise indicated refers to the act of treating.

The phrase a method of treating or its equivalent when applied to for example cancer refers to a procedure or course of action that is designed to reduce or eliminate the number of cancer cells in an animal or to alleviate the symptoms of a cancer. A method of treating cancer or another proliferative disorder does not necessarily mean that the cancer cells or other disorder will in fact be eliminated that the number of cells or disorder will in fact be reduced or that the symptoms of a cancer or other disorder will in fact be alleviated. Often a method of treating cancer will be performed even with a low likelihood of success but which given the medical history and estimated survival expectancy of an animal is nevertheless deemed an overall beneficial course of action.

The term an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors when used herein without further qualification as to the nature of the agent refers to an mTOR inhibitor.

The phrase mTOR inhibitor that binds to and directly inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases when used herein refers to an mTOR inhibitor that interacts with and reduces the kinase activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes.

The term therapeutically effective agent means a composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue system animal or human that is being sought by the researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician.

The term therapeutically effective amount or effective amount means the amount of the subject compound or combination that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue system animal or human that is being sought by the researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician.

The present invention derives from research that provided methods for determining which tumors will respond most effectively to treatment with EGFR kinase inhibitors Thompson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 based on whether the tumor cells have undergone an epithelial to mesenchymal transition EMT Thiery J. P. 2002 Nat. Rev. Cancer 2 442 454 Savagner P. 2001 Bioessays 23 912 923 Kang Y. and Massague J. 2004 Cell 118 277 279 Julien Grille S. et al. Cancer Research 63 2172 2178 Bates R. C. et al. 2003 Current Biology 13 1721 1727 Lu Z. et al. 2003 Cancer Cell. 4 6 499 515 . This work demonstrated that epithelial cells respond well to EGFR kinase inhibitors but that after an EMT the cells become much less sensitive to such inhibitors. Such knowledge of the cellular characteristics associated with sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors and a knowledge of the biochemical pathways that regulate EMT or the reverse process a mesenchymal to epithelial transition MET allows one to design agents such as the mTOR inhibitors described herein that sensitize tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors enabling relatively insensitive cells to become sensitive or sensitive cells to have increased sensitivity. Biomarkers can be used to determine whether tumor cells have undergone an EMT Thomson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 .

The data presented in the Examples herein below demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors are agents that can sensitize NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors. Thus the anti tumor effects of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and such an agent are superior to the anti tumor effects of either inhibitor by itself and co administration of an mTOR inhibitor with an EGFR kinase inhibitor can be effective for treatment of patients with advanced cancers such as NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancers. The sensitizing effect of mTOR inhibitors is seen most frequently in tumor cells that have undergone an EMT or are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitors. In such cells synergy is frequently observed when an EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor are used in combination to inhibit tumor cell growth.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor. The present invention also provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a synergistically effective therapeutic amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor. The present invention also provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors wherein said agent is an mTOR inhibitor. In an embodiment of any of the above methods the cells of the NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases have high sensitivity or are very sensitive to growth inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib as single agents i.e. without any agent that sensitizes the tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors such as epithelial cells that have not undergone any form of EMT e.g. H292 H358 or BxPC3 tumor cells . In another embodiment of any of the above methods the cells of the NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases have low sensitivity or are relatively insensitive or refractory to growth inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib as single agents such as epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT and have acquired mesenchymal characteristics e.g. H460 or Calu6 tumor cells .

In a further embodiment of the above methods the patient to be treated is tested prior to treatment using a diagnostic assay to determine the sensitivity of tumor cells to an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Any method known in the art that can determine the sensitivity of the tumor cells of a patient to an EGFR kinase inhibitor can be employed. For example a method to determine a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor can comprise assessing whether the tumor cells have undergone an epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT by for example determining the expression level of one or more tumor cell epithelial and or mesenchymal biomarkers thus identifying the patient as one who is less likely or not likely to demonstrate an effective response to treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent if their tumor cells have undergone an EMT e.g. see Thompson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 and US Published Patent Application US 2006 0211060 A1 both incorporated herein by reference . For example the expression level of one or more tumor cell epithelial biomarkers E cadherin Brk catenin 1 catenin 2 catenin 3 catenin keratin 8 keratin 18 connexin 31 plakophilin 3 stratifin 1 laminin alpha 5 or ST14 can be assessed a high level indicating that the tumor cells have probably not undergone an EMT. Similarly the expression level of one or more tumor cell mesenchymal biomarkers vimentin fibronectin 1 fibrillin 1 fibrillin 2 collagen alpha2 IV collagen alpha2 V LOXL1 nidogen C11orf9 tenascin N cadherin tubulin alpha 3 or epimorphin can be assessed a high level indicating that the tumor cells have probably undergone an EMT. Other methods that may be utilized to assess the sensitivity of the tumor cells of a patient to an EGFR kinase inhibitor include determining the presence of mutant forms of EGFR known to confer an enhanced sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors or directly determining in a tumor cell biopsy the sensitivity of a patients tumor cells to an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

In the above embodiments where the patient is tested prior to treatment using a diagnostic assay to determine the sensitivity of tumor cells to an EGFR kinase inhibitor in one embodiment when the patient is identified as one whose tumor cells are predicted to have low sensitivity to an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent and thus based on the results described herein are likely to display enhanced sensitivity in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor the patient is administered simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor. In another embodiment when the patient is identified as one whose tumor cells are predicted to have high sensitivity to an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent but may also display enhanced sensitivity in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor based on the results described herein the patient is administered simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor. For these methods an example of a preferred EGFR kinase inhibitor would be erlotinib including pharmacologically acceptable salts or polymorphs thereof. In these methods one or more additional anti cancer agents or treatments can be co administered simultaneously or sequentially with the EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor as judged to be appropriate by the administering physician given the prediction of the likely responsiveness of the patient to the combination of EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor in combination with any additional circumstances pertaining to the individual patient.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising the steps of diagnosing a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor and administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor.

The present invention also provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising the steps of diagnosing a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor identifying the patient as one whose tumor or tumor metastases cells are relatively insensitive to an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent and thus likely to show an enhanced response in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor and administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor.

The present invention also provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising the steps of diagnosing a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor by assessing whether the tumor cells have undergone an epithelial mesenchymal transition identifying the patient as one whose tumor or tumor metastases cells have not undergone an epithelial mesenchymal transition and are thus predicted to be relatively sensitive to an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent and may thus show an enhanced response in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor and administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor.

In a further embodiment of the above methods the patient to be treated is refractory to treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent. Thus for example in one embodiment the present invention provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient refractory to treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent comprising administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor. In an alternative embodiment the present invention provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient refractory to treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent comprising the steps of diagnosing a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor and administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the medical arts that there are many reasons for why a patient may be refractory to treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent one of which is that the tumor cells of the patient are relatively insensitive to inhibition by the tested EGFR kinase inhibitor. It is also possible that a patient may be refractory to treatment with one type of EGFR kinase inhibitor but be sensitive to treatment with another type of EGFR kinase inhibitor.

This invention also provides a method for treating abnormal cell growth of lung pancreatic colon or breast cancer cells in a patient comprising administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor.

It will be appreciated by one of skill in the medical arts that the exact manner of administering to said patient of a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor following a diagnosis of a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor will be at the discretion of the attending physician. The mode of administration including dosage combination with other anti cancer agents timing and frequency of administration and the like may be affected by the diagnosis of a patient s likely responsiveness to an EGFR kinase inhibitor as well as the patient s condition and history. Thus even patients diagnosed with tumors predicted to be relatively sensitive to an EGFR kinase inhibitor as a single agent may still benefit from treatment with a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor particularly in combination with other anti cancer agents or other agents that may alter a tumor s sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors.

In one embodiment of the methods of this invention an mTOR inhibitor is administered at the same time as the EGFR kinase inhibitor. In another embodiment of the methods of this invention an mTOR inhibitor is administered prior to the EGFR kinase inhibitor. In another embodiment of the methods of this invention an mTOR inhibitor is administered after the EGFR kinase inhibitor. In another embodiment of the methods of this invention an mTOR inhibitor is pre administered prior to administration of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor.

The present invention further provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to said patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors and in addition one or more anti hormonal agents. As used herein the term anti hormonal agent includes natural or synthetic organic or peptidic compounds that act to regulate or inhibit hormone action on tumors.

Antihormonal agents include for example steroid receptor antagonists anti estrogens such as tamoxifen raloxifene aromatase inhibiting 4 5 imidazoles other aromatase inhibitors 42 hydroxytamoxifen trioxifene keoxifene LY 117018 onapristone and toremifene e.g. FARESTON anti androgens such as flutamide nilutamide bicalutamide leuprolide and goserelin and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above agonists and or antagonists of glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone FSH thyroid stimulating hormone TSH and luteinizing hormone LH and LHRH leuteinizing hormone releasing hormone the LHRH agonist goserelin acetate commercially available as ZOLADEX AstraZeneca the LHRH antagonist D alaninamide N acetyl 3 2 naphthalenyl D alanyl 4 chloro D phenylalanyl 3 3 pyridinyl D alanyl L seryl N 6 3 pyridinylcarbonyl L lysyl N 6 3 pyridinylcarbonyl D lysyl L leucyl N 6 1 methylethyl L lysyl L proline e.g ANTIDE Ares Serono the LHRH antagonist ganirelix acetate the steroidal anti androgens cyproterone acetate CPA and megestrol acetate commercially available as MEGACE Bristol Myers Oncology the nonsteroidal anti androgen flutamide 2 methyl N 4 20 nitro 3 trifluoromethyl phenylpropanamide commercially available as EULEXIN Schering Corp. the non steroidal anti androgen nilutamide 5 5 dimethyl 3 4 nitro 3 trifluoromethyl 4 nitrophenyl 4 4 dimethyl imidazolidine dione and antagonists for other non permissive receptors such as antagonists for RAR RXR TR VDR and the like.

The use of the cytotoxic and other anticancer agents described above in chemotherapeutic regimens is generally well characterized in the cancer therapy arts and their use herein falls under the same considerations for monitoring tolerance and effectiveness and for controlling administration routes and dosages with some adjustments. For example the actual dosages of the cytotoxic agents may vary depending upon the patient s cultured cell response determined by using histoculture methods. Generally the dosage will be reduced compared to the amount used in the absence of additional other agents.

Typical dosages of an effective cytotoxic agent can be in the ranges recommended by the manufacturer and where indicated by in vitro responses or responses in animal models can be reduced by up to about one order of magnitude concentration or amount. Thus the actual dosage will depend upon the judgment of the physician the condition of the patient and the effectiveness of the therapeutic method based on the in vitro responsiveness of the primary cultured malignant cells or histocultured tissue sample or the responses observed in the appropriate animal models.

The present invention further provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors and in addition treatment with radiation or a radiopharmaceutical.

The source of radiation can be either external or internal to the patient being treated. When the source is external to the patient the therapy is known as external beam radiation therapy EBRT . When the source of radiation is internal to the patient the treatment is called brachytherapy BT . Radioactive atoms for use in the context of this invention can be selected from the group including but not limited to radium cesium 137 iridium 192 americium 241 gold 198 cobalt 57 copper 67 technetium 99 iodine 123 iodine 131 and indium 111. Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor according to this invention is an antibody it is also possible to label the antibody with such radioactive isotopes.

Radiation therapy is a standard treatment for controlling unresectable or inoperable tumors and or tumor metastases. Improved results have been seen when radiation therapy has been combined with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is based on the principle that high dose radiation delivered to a target area will result in the death of reproductive cells in both tumor and normal tissues. The radiation dosage regimen is generally defined in terms of radiation absorbed dose Gy time and fractionation and must be carefully defined by the oncologist. The amount of radiation a patient receives will depend on various considerations but the two most important are the location of the tumor in relation to other critical structures or organs of the body and the extent to which the tumor has spread. A typical course of treatment for a patient undergoing radiation therapy will be a treatment schedule over a 1 to 6 week period with a total dose of between 10 and 80 Gy administered to the patient in a single daily fraction of about 1.8 to 2.0 Gy 5 days a week. In a preferred embodiment of this invention there is synergy when tumors in human patients are treated with the combination treatment of the invention and radiation. In other words the inhibition of tumor growth by means of the agents comprising the combination of the invention is enhanced when combined with radiation optionally with additional chemotherapeutic or anticancer agents. Parameters of adjuvant radiation therapies are for example contained in International Patent Publication WO 99 60023.

The present invention further provides a method for treating NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors and in addition treatment with one or more agents capable of enhancing antitumor immune responses.

Agents capable of enhancing antitumor immune responses include for example CTLA4 cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen 4 antibodies e.g. MDX CTLA4 and other agents capable of blocking CTLA4. Specific CTLA4 antibodies that can be used in the present invention include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 682 736.

The present invention further provides a method for reducing the side effects caused by the treatment of NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient with an EGFR kinase inhibitor or an mTOR inhibitor comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors i.e. an mTOR inhibitor in amounts that are effective to produce an additive or a superadditive or synergistic antitumor effect and that are effective at inhibiting the growth of the tumor.

The present invention further provides a method for the treatment of NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment i an effective first amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and ii an effective second amount of an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors.

The present invention also provides a method for the treatment of NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment i a sub therapeutic first amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and ii a sub therapeutic second amount of an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors.

The present invention also provides a method for the treatment of NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment i an effective first amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and ii a sub therapeutic second amount of an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors.

The present invention also provides a method for the treatment of NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment i a sub therapeutic first amount of an EGFR kinase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and ii an effective second amount of an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors.

In the preceding methods the order of administration of the first and second amounts can be simultaneous or sequential i.e. the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors can be administered before the EGFR kinase inhibitor after the EGFR inhibitor or at the same time as the EGFR kinase inhibitor. In an alternative embodiment of each of these methods the NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer has low sensitivity or is relatively insensitive or refractory to inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib as single agents.

In the context of this invention an effective amount of an agent or therapy is as defined above. A sub therapeutic amount of an agent or therapy is an amount less than the effective amount for that agent or therapy but when combined with an effective or sub therapeutic amount of another agent or therapy can produce a result desired by the physician due to for example synergy in the resulting efficacious effects or reduced side effects.

Additionally the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

As used herein the term patient preferably refers to a human in need of treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor for any purpose and more preferably a human in need of such a treatment to treat cancer or a precancerous condition or lesion. However the term patient can also refer to non human animals preferably mammals such as dogs cats horses cows pigs sheep and non human primates among others that are in need of treatment with an EGFR kinase inhibitor.

In a preferred embodiment the patient is a human in need of treatment for cancer or a precancerous condition or lesion wherein the cancer is preferably NSCL breast colon or pancreatic cancer. In addition other cancers that may be treated by the methods described herein include examples of the following cancers that are treatable by administration of an EGFR kinase inhibitor lung cancer bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer bone cancer skin cancer cancer of the head or neck cutaneous or intraocular melanoma uterine cancer ovarian cancer rectal cancer cancer of the anal region stomach cancer gastric cancer uterine cancer carcinoma of the fallopian tubes carcinoma of the endometrium carcinoma of the vagina carcinoma of the vulva Hodgkin s Disease cancer of the esophagus cancer of the small intestine cancer of the endocrine system cancer of the thyroid gland cancer of the parathyroid gland cancer of the adrenal gland sarcoma of soft tissue cancer of the urethra cancer of the penis prostate cancer cancer of the bladder cancer of the ureter carcinoma of the renal pelvis mesothelioma hepatocellular cancer biliary cancer chronic or acute leukemia lymphocytic lymphomas neoplasms of the central nervous system CNS spinal axis tumors brain stem glioma glioblastoma multiforme astrocytomas schwannomas ependymomas medulloblastomas meningiomas squamous cell carcinomas pituitary adenomas including refractory versions of any of the above cancers or a combination of one or more of the above cancers. The precancerous condition or lesion includes for example the group consisting of oral leukoplakia actinic keratosis solar keratosis precancerous polyps of the colon or rectum gastric epithelial dysplasia adenomatous dysplasia hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome HNPCC Barrett s esophagus bladder dysplasia and precancerous cervical conditions. In addition other cancers that may be treated by the methods described herein include examples of the following cancers that are treatable by administration of the EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib cancer of the kidney or renal cell carcinoma.

The term refractory as used herein is used to define a cancer for which treatment e.g. chemotherapy drugs biological agents and or radiation therapy has proven to be ineffective. A refractory cancer tumor may shrink but not to the point where the treatment is determined to be effective. Typically however the tumor stays the same size as it was before treatment stable disease or it grows progressive disease .

For purposes of the present invention co administration of and co administering an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors both components referred to hereinafter as the two active agents refer to any administration of the two active agents either separately or together where the two active agents are administered as part of an appropriate dose regimen designed to obtain the benefit of the combination therapy. Thus the two active agents can be administered either as part of the same pharmaceutical composition or in separate pharmaceutical compositions. The agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors can be administered prior to at the same time as or subsequent to administration of the EGFR kinase inhibitor or in some combination thereof. Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor is administered to the patient at repeated intervals e.g. during a standard course of treatment the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors can be administered prior to at the same time as or subsequent to each administration of the EGFR kinase inhibitor or some combination thereof or at different intervals in relation to the EGFR kinase inhibitor treatment or in a single dose prior to at any time during or subsequent to the course of treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor.

The EGFR kinase inhibitor will typically be administered to the patient in a dose regimen that provides for the most effective treatment of the cancer from both efficacy and safety perspectives for which the patient is being treated as known in the art and as disclosed e.g. in International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574. In conducting the treatment method of the present invention the EGFR kinase inhibitor can be administered in any effective manner known in the art such as by oral topical intravenous intra peritoneal intramuscular intra articular subcutaneous intranasal intra ocular vaginal rectal or intradermal routes depending upon the type of cancer being treated the type of EGFR kinase inhibitor being used for example small molecule antibody RNAi ribozyme or antisense construct and the medical judgement of the prescribing physician as based e.g. on the results of published clinical studies.

The amount of EGFR kinase inhibitor administered and the timing of EGFR kinase inhibitor administration will depend on the type species gender age weight etc. and condition of the patient being treated the severity of the disease or condition being treated and on the route of administration. For example small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 0.001 to 100 mg kg of body weight per day or per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion see for example International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574 . In particular erlotinib HCl can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 5 200 mg per day or 100 1600 mg per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion. A preferred dose is 150 mg day. Antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors or antisense RNAi or ribozyme constructs can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 0.1 to 100 mg kg of body weight per day or per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.

The EGFR kinase inhibitors and the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors can be administered either separately or together by the same or different routes and in a wide variety of different dosage forms. For example the EGFR kinase inhibitor is preferably administered orally or parenterally. The agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors is preferably administered orally or parenterally. Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor is erlotinib HCl TARCEVA oral administration is preferable. Both the EGFR kinase inhibitors and the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors can be administered in single or multiple doses. In one embodiment the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors is administered first as a pretreatment followed by administration of the combination of both agents EGFR kinase inhibitor and the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors either separately or combined together in one formulation.

The EGFR kinase inhibitor can be administered with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets capsules lozenges troches hard candies powders sprays creams salves suppositories jellies gels pastes lotions ointments elixirs syrups and the like. Administration of such dosage forms can be carried out in single or multiple doses. Carriers include solid diluents or fillers sterile aqueous media and various non toxic organic solvents etc. Oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and or flavored.

The EGFR kinase inhibitor and the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors can be combined together with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of sprays creams salves suppositories jellies gels pastes lotions ointments and the like. Administration of such dosage forms can be carried out in single or multiple doses. Carriers include solid diluents or fillers sterile aqueous media and various non toxic organic solvents etc.

All formulations comprising proteinaceous EGFR kinase inhibitors should be selected so as to avoid denaturation and or degradation and loss of biological activity of the inhibitor.

Methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising an EGFR kinase inhibitor are known in the art and are described e.g. in International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574. Methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising mTOR inhibitors are also well known in the art e.g. see International Patent Publication WO 2004 004644 or patents on rapamycin macrolides referred to therein . In view of the teaching of the present invention methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising both an EGFR kinase inhibitor and the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors will be apparent from the above cited publications and from other known references such as Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 18edition 1990 .

For oral administration of EGFR kinase inhibitors tablets containing one or both of the active agents are combined with any of various excipients such as for example micro crystalline cellulose sodium citrate calcium carbonate dicalcium phosphate and glycine along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably corn potato or tapioca starch alginic acid and certain complex silicates together with granulation binders like polyvinyl pyrrolidone sucrose gelatin and acacia. Additionally lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the EGFR kinase inhibitor may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matter or dyes and if so desired emulsifying and or suspending agents as well together with such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various like combinations thereof.

For parenteral administration of either or both of the active agents solutions in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed as well as sterile aqueous solutions comprising the active agent or a corresponding water soluble salt thereof. Such sterile aqueous solutions are preferably suitably buffered and are also preferably rendered isotonic e.g. with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intra articular intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Any parenteral formulation selected for administration of proteinaceous EGFR kinase inhibitors should be selected so as to avoid denaturation and loss of biological activity of the inhibitor.

Additionally it is possible to topically administer either or both of the active agents by way of for example creams lotions jellies gels pastes ointments salves and the like in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. For example a topical formulation comprising either an EGFR kinase inhibitor or the agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors in about 0.1 w v to about 5 w v concentration can be prepared.

For veterinary purposes the active agents can be administered separately or together to animals using any of the forms and by any of the routes described above. In a preferred embodiment the EGFR kinase inhibitor is administered in the form of a capsule bolus tablet liquid drench by injection or as an implant. As an alternative the EGFR kinase inhibitor can be administered with the animal feedstuff and for this purpose a concentrated feed additive or premix may be prepared for a normal animal feed. The agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors is preferably administered in the form of liquid drench by injection or as an implant.

As used herein the term EGFR kinase inhibitor refers to any EGFR kinase inhibitor that is currently known in the art or that will be identified in the future and includes any chemical entity that upon administration to a patient results in inhibition of a biological activity associated with activation of the EGF receptor in the patient including any of the downstream biological effects otherwise resulting from the binding to EGFR of its natural ligand. Such EGFR kinase inhibitors include any agent that can block EGFR activation or any of the downstream biological effects of EGFR activation that are relevant to treating cancer in a patient. Such an inhibitor can act by binding directly to the intracellular domain of the receptor and inhibiting its kinase activity. Alternatively such an inhibitor can act by occupying the ligand binding site or a portion thereof of the EGF receptor thereby making the receptor inaccessible to its natural ligand so that its normal biological activity is prevented or reduced. Alternatively such an inhibitor can act by modulating the dimerization of EGFR polypeptides or interaction of EGFR polypeptide with other proteins or enhance ubiquitination and endocytotic degradation of EGFR. EGFR kinase inhibitors include but are not limited to low molecular weight inhibitors antibodies or antibody fragments peptide or RNA aptamers antisense constructs small inhibitory RNAs i.e. RNA interference by dsRNA RNAi and ribozymes. In a preferred embodiment the EGFR kinase inhibitor is a small organic molecule or an antibody that binds specifically to the human EGFR.

Examples of such compounds include the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor CI 1033 formerly known as PD183805 Pfizer the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor GW 2016 also known as GW 572016 or lapatinib ditosylate GSK the EGFR and JAK 2 3 inhibitor AG490 a tyrphostin the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor ARRY 334543 Array BioPharma BIBW 2992 an irreversible dual EGFR HER2 kinase inhibitor Boehringer Ingelheim Corp. the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor EKB 569 Wyeth the VEGF R2 and EGFR inhibitor ZD6474 also known as ZACTIMA AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals and the EGFR and HER2 inhibitor BMS 599626 Bristol Myers Squibb .

Antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors include any anti EGFR antibody or antibody fragment that can partially or completely block EGFR activation by its natural ligand. Non limiting examples of antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors include those described in Modjtahedi H. et al. 1993 Br. J. Cancer 67 247 253 Teramoto T. et al. 1996 Cancer 77 639 645 Goldstein et al. 1995 Clin. Cancer Res. 1 1311 1318 Huang S. M. et al. 1999 Cancer Res. 15 59 8 1935 40 and Yang X. et al. 1999 Cancer Res. 59 1236 1243. Thus the EGFR kinase inhibitor can be the monoclonal antibody Mab E7.6.3 Yang X. D. et al. 1999 Cancer Res. 59 1236 43 or Mab C225 ATCC Accession No. HB 8508 or an antibody or antibody fragment having the binding specificity thereof. Suitable monoclonal antibody EGFR kinase inhibitors include but are not limited to IMC C225 also known as cetuximab or ERBITUX Imclone Systems ABX EGF Abgenix EMD 72000 Merck KgaA Darmstadt RH3 York Medical Bioscience Inc. and MDX 447 Medarex Merck KgaA .

Additional antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors can be raised according to known methods by administering the appropriate antigen or epitope to a host animal selected e.g. from pigs cows horses rabbits goats sheep and mice among others. Various adjuvants known in the art can be used to enhance antibody production.

Although antibodies useful in practicing the invention can be polyclonal monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR can be prepared and isolated using any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Techniques for production and isolation include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein Nature 1975 256 495 497 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kosbor et al. 1983 Immunology Today 4 72 Cote et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 2026 2030 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al 1985 Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 .

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 can be adapted to produce anti EGFR single chain antibodies. Antibody based EGFR kinase inhibitors useful in practicing the present invention also include anti EGFR antibody fragments including but not limited to F ab .sub.2 fragments which can be generated by pepsin digestion of an intact antibody molecule and Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab .sub.2 fragments. Alternatively Fab and or scFv expression libraries can be constructed see e.g. Huse et al. 1989 Science 246 1275 1281 to allow rapid identification of fragments having the desired specificity to EGFR.

Techniques for the production and isolation of monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments are well known in the art and are described in Harlow and Lane 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and in J. W. Goding 1986 Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice Academic Press London. Humanized anti EGFR antibodies and antibody fragments can also be prepared according to known techniques such as those described in Vaughn T. J. et al. 1998 Nature Biotech. 16 535 539 and references cited therein and such antibodies or fragments thereof are also useful in practicing the present invention.

EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention can alternatively be peptide or RNA aptamers. Such aptamers can for example interact with the extracellular or intracellular domains of EGFR to inhibit EGFR kinase activity in cells. An aptamer that interacts with the extracellular domain is preferred as it would not be necessary for such an aptamer to cross the plasma membrane of the target cell. An aptamer could also interact with the ligand for EGFR e.g. EGF TGF such that its ability to activate EGFR is inhibited. Methods for selecting an appropriate aptamer are well known in the art. Such methods have been used to select both peptide and RNA aptamers that interact with and inhibit EGFR family members e.g. see Buerger C. et al. et al. 2003 J. Biol. Chem. 278 37610 37621 Chen C H. B. et al. 2003 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100 9226 9231 Buerger C. and Groner B. 2003 J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 129 12 669 675. Epub 2003 Sep. 11. .

EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention can alternatively be based on antisense oligonucleotide constructs. Anti sense oligonucleotides including anti sense RNA molecules and anti sense DNA molecules would act to directly block the translation of EGFR mRNA by binding thereto and thus preventing protein translation or increasing mRNA degradation thus decreasing the level of EGFR kinase protein and thus activity in a cell. For example antisense oligonucleotides of at least about 15 bases and complementary to unique regions of the mRNA transcript sequence encoding EGFR can be synthesized e.g. by conventional phosphodiester techniques and administered by e.g. intravenous injection or infusion. Methods for using antisense techniques for specifically inhibiting gene expression of genes whose sequence is known are well known in the art e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 566 135 6 566 131 6 365 354 6 410 323 6 107 091 6 046 321 and 5 981 732 .

Small inhibitory RNAs siRNAs can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. EGFR gene expression can be reduced by contacting the tumor subject or cell with a small double stranded RNA dsRNA or a vector or construct causing the production of a small double stranded RNA such that expression of EGFR is specifically inhibited i.e. RNA interference or RNAi . Methods for selecting an appropriate dsRNA or dsRNA encoding vector are well known in the art for genes whose sequence is known e.g. see Tuschi T. et al. 1999 Genes Dev. 13 24 3191 3197 Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 498 Hannon G. J. 2002 Nature 418 244 251 McManus M. T. and Sharp P. A. 2002 Nature Reviews Genetics 3 737 747 Bremmelkamp T. R. et al. 2002 Science 296 550 553 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 573 099 and 6 506 559 and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01 36646 WO 99 32619 and WO 01 68836 .

Ribozymes can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Engineered hairpin or hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of EGFR mRNA sequences are thereby useful within the scope of the present invention. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which typically include the following sequences GUA GUU and GUC. Once identified short RNA sequences of between about 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site can be evaluated for predicted structural features such as secondary structure that can render the oligonucleotide sequence unsuitable. The suitability of candidate targets can also be evaluated by testing their accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides using e.g. ribonuclease protection assays.

Both antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes useful as EGFR kinase inhibitors can be prepared by known methods. These include techniques for chemical synthesis such as e.g. by solid phase phosphoramadite chemical synthesis. Alternatively anti sense RNA molecules can be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the RNA molecule. Such DNA sequences can be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors that incorporate suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Various modifications to the oligonucleotides of the invention can be introduced as a means of increasing intracellular stability and half life. Possible modifications include but are not limited to the addition of flanking sequences of ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides to the 5 and or 3 ends of the molecule or the use of phosphorothioate or 2 O methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages within the oligonucleotide backbone.

As used herein the term an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors when used without further qualification as to the nature of the agent refers to an mTOR inhibitor. An mTOR inhibitor can be any mTOR inhibitor that is currently known in the art or that will be identified in the future and includes any chemical entity that upon administration to a patient results in inhibition of mTOR in the patient. An mTOR inhibitor can inhibit mTOR by any biochemical mechanism including competition at the ATP binding site competition elsewhere at the catalytic site of mTOR kinase non competitive inhibition irreversible inhibition e.g. covalent protein modification or modulation of the interactions of other protein subunits or binding proteins with mTOR kinase in a way that results in inhibition of mTOR kinase activity e.g. modulation of the interaction of mTOR with FKBP12 G L mLST8 RAPTOR mKOG1 or RICTOR mAVO3 . Specific examples of mTOR inhibitors include rapamycin other rapamycin macrolides or rapamycin analogues derivatives or prodrugs RAD001 also known as Everolimus RAD001 is an alkylated rapamycin 40 O 2 hydroxyethyl rapamycin disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 665 772 Novartis CCI 779 also known as Temsirolimus CCI 779 is an ester of rapamycin 42 ester with 3 hydroxy 2 hydroxymethyl 2 methylpropionic acid disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Rapamycin derivatives are also disclosed for example in WO 94 09010 WO 95 16691 WO 96 41807 or WO 99 15530 which are incorporated herein by reference. Such analogs and derivatives include 32 deoxorapamycin 16 pent 2 ynyloxy 32 deoxorapamycin 16 pent 2 ynyloxy 32 S or R dihydro rapamycin 16 pent 2 ynyloxy 32 S or R dihydro 40 O 2 hydroxyethyl rapamycin 40 0 2 hydroxyethyl rapamycin 32 deoxorapamycin and 16 pent 2 ynyloxy 32 S dihydro rapamycin. Rapamycin derivatives may also include the so called rapalogs e.g. as disclosed in WO 98 02441 and WO01 14387 e.g. AP23573 AP23464 AP23675 or AP23841 . Further examples of a rapamycin derivative are those disclosed under the name biolimus 7 or biolimus 9 BIOLIMUS A9 Biosensors International Singapore . Any of the above rapamycin analogs or derivatives may be readily prepared by procedures as described in the above references.

Additional examples of mTOR inhibitors useful in the invention described herein include those disclosed and claimed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 599 663 filed Nov. 15 2006 a series of compounds that inhibit mTOR by binding to and directly inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases. The latter application is incorporated herein in its entirety. Examples of such compounds and their synthesis are described herein in the Experimental Methods section below under Drugs . Two such compounds are Compound A and Compound B for which data indicating their utility in the methods of this invention is included and described herein. These two compounds exhibit either synergy or additivity in inhibiting tumor cell growth or proliferation when used in combination with an EGFR kinase inhibitor depending on the tumor cell type and EMT status. Synergy is observed in the majority of tumor cell types e.g. see Experimental Details herein . Similar results can be obtained with any compound that inhibits mTOR by binding to and directly inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases such as whose structures are disclosed herein see Experimental Section . Additional such compounds can readily be identified by determining their ability to inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities using immunoprecipiation kinase assays with antibodies specific to either the raptor or rictor proteins of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes for an example of such assays see Jacinto E. et al. 2004 Nature Cell Biol. 6 11 1122 1128 .

Compounds that inhibit mTOR by binding to and directly inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases have a number of important advantages over compounds like rapamycin or its analogues that only directly inhibit mTORC1. These include a superior inhibition of pAkt and concomitant induction of apoptosis in tumor cells b complete inhibition of all phosphorylation of 4E BP1 which results in greater anti proliferative effects c inhibition of pAkt S473 in all tumor cells thus leading to superior pro apoptotic effects rapamycin inhibits pAkt S473 in only 20 of cancer cell lines d treatment does not increase pAkt S473 in any cancer cell type tested and so does not promote tumor cell survival unlike rapamycin treatment which increases pAkt S473 in 65 of cell lines and e anti proliferative activity in a far broader spectrum of tumor cells N.B. approximately 50 of cell lines in a given tumor type are insensitive to rapamycin .

Also useful in the invention described herein are mTOR inhibitors that are dual PI3K mTOR kinase inhibitors such as for example the compound PI 103 as described in Fan Q W et al 2006 Cancer Cell 9 341 349 and Knight Z. A. et al. 2006 Cell 125 733 747.

Compounds that inhibit mTOR kinase but are non specific kinase inhibitors that are relatively toxic to normal non neoplastic cells and thus not suitable for administration as a therapeutic such as for example the PI3 kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 Brunn G. J. et al 1996 Embo J. 15 5256 5267 are not suitable for use in the methods of the invention described herein.

In an embodiment of any of the above uses the cells of the NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases have high sensitivity or are very sensitive to growth inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib as single agents i.e. without any agent that sensitizes the tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors such as epithelial cells that have not undergone any form of EMT e.g. like H292 H358 or BxPC3 tumor cells . In another embodiment of any of the above uses the cells of the NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases have low sensitivity or are relatively insensitive to growth inhibition by EGFR kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib as single agents such as epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT and have acquired mesenchymal characteristics e.g. like H460 or Calu6 tumor cells . In an alternative embodiment of any of the above uses the present invention also encompasses the use of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor combination in combination with another anti cancer agent or agent that enhances the effect of such an agent for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of NSCL pancreatic colon or breast cancer tumors or tumor metastases in a patient in need thereof wherein each inhibitor in the combination can be administered to the patient either simultaneously or sequentially. In this context the other anti cancer agent or agent that enhances the effect of such an agent can be any of the agents listed above that can be added to the EGFR kinase inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor combination when treating patients.

The invention also encompasses a pharmaceutical composition that is comprised of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Particularly preferred are citric hydrobromic hydrochloric maleic phosphoric sulfuric and tartaric acids.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of each component thereof as active ingredients a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients or adjuvants. Other therapeutic agents may include those cytotoxic chemotherapeutic or anti cancer agents or agents which enhance the effects of such agents as listed above. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral rectal topical and parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular and intravenous administration although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the particular host and nature and severity of the conditions for which the active ingredient is being administered. The pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.

In practice the compounds represented by the combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of each component thereof of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration e.g. oral or parenteral including intravenous . Thus the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be presented as discrete units suitable for oral administration such as capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Further the compositions can be presented as a powder as granules as a solution as a suspension in an aqueous liquid as a non aqueous liquid as an oil in water emulsion or as a water in oil liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of each component thereof may also be administered by controlled release means and or delivery devices. The combination compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general such methods include a step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the carrier that constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. The product can then be conveniently shaped into the desired presentation.

Thus the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of each component thereof . A combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an agent that sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of each component thereof can also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more other therapeutically active compounds. Other therapeutically active compounds may include those cytotoxic chemotherapeutic or anti cancer agents or agents which enhance the effects of such agents as listed above.

This invention will be better understood from the Experimental Details that follow. However one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific methods and results discussed are merely illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter and are not to be considered in any way limited thereto.

Recent reports in the literature have suggested that combining EGFR inhibitors with agents that antagonize downstream signaling pathways may permit sensitization in cell lines that either have redundancy in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling or contain specific mutations in downstream signaling. Herein the present inventors have determined the correlation between erlotinib s ability to regulate the activity of the PI3K PDK1 Akt mTOR pathway and sensitivity to growth inhibition in a group of 22 cell lines derived from breast colon pancreatic and NSCL tumors. It was found that in cell lines sensitive to growth inhibition by erlotinib there is down modulation of the activity of this pathway. In less sensitive cell lines erlotinib is ineffective at fully down regulating S6 ribosomal protein below basal levels a substrate downstream of mTOR. Here mTOR activity is likely controlled at least to some extent by EGFR independent mechanisms including other growth factors or mutations.

It had not been previously determined if it was possible to combine erlotinib with another targeted agent in order to sensitize breast colon pancreatic or NSCL tumor cells that poorly respond to erlotinib as a single agent. Unlike cytotoxic chemotherapies that often share similar toxicities molecular targeted agents tend to have non overlapping toxicities and thus identifying cocktails of targeted agents to block cancer cell growth may be more clinically feasible. The present inventors have determined the effect of combining erlotinib with rapamycin a targeted agent that acts downstream of EGFR to directly inactivate mTOR. Rapamycin is a high molecular weight polyketide natural product derived from a soil bacteria identified on the island Rapa Nui. It acts by disrupting the protein protein interactions between raptor and mTOR. mTOR requires raptor to interact with a number of substrate proteins including 4EBP1 and S6K thus inhibiting this interaction blocks some of mTOR s functions. Synergistic behavior of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin combined with EGFR inhibitors to block tumor cell growth had been previously reported for renal cell carcinoma and glioblastomas but had not been examined in breast colon pancreatic or NSCL tumors.

Herein it is demonstrated that rapamycin can re sensitize breast colon pancreatic or NSCL tumor cell lines that are relatively insensitive to erlotinib as a single agent. Thus combining an mTOR inhibitor with an EGFR kinase inhibitor such as erlotinib should be useful clinically in patients with breast colon pancreatic or NSCL tumors.

The selective HER1 EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib was synthesized by OSI Pharmaceuticals Uniondale N.Y. USA as the hydrochloride salt erlotinib HCl TARCEVA .

Rapamycin for in vitro experiments was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals St. Louis Mo. and for xenograft experiments from LC Laboratories Woburn Mass. .

Analysis of Additivity and Synergy The Bliss additivism model was used to classify the effect of combining rapamycin and erlotinib as additive synergistic or antagonistic. A theoretical curve was calculated for combined inhibition using the equation E E E E E where Eand Eare the fractional inhibitions obtained by drug A alone and drug B alone at specific concentrations. Here Eis the fractional inhibition that would be expected if the combination of the two drugs was exactly additive. If the experimentally measured fractional inhibition is less than Ethe combination was said to be synergistic. If the experimentally measured fractional inhibition is greater than Ethe combination was said to be antagonistic. For dose response curves the Bliss additivity value was calculated for varying doses of drug A when combined with a constant dose of drug B. This allowed an assessment as to whether drug B affected the potency of drug A or shifted its intrinsic activity. All plots were generated using PRISM software Graphpad Software San Diego Calif. .

The tumor volume was determined by measuring in two directions with vernier calipers and calculated using the formula Tumor volume length width 2. The data were plotted as the change in mean values of tumor volume and body weight for each group. The tumor growth inhibition TGI was determined as TGI 100 1 W W where Wt is the median tumor volume of the treated group at time x and We is the median tumor volume of the control group at time x. Tarceva was dosed in a 6 Captisol CyDex Inc in WFI Water for Injection solution and all control animals were dosed with an equal volume of the vehicle. Tarceva animals were dosed by oral gavage once a day for 18 days and the TGI measured on day 19. Rapamycin was dosed in 4 ethanol 5 PEG400 5 Tween 80 in WFI. Rapamycin animals were dosed by intraperitoneal injection on day 1 8 and 15 and all control animals were dosed with an equal volume of the vehicle.

Studies on the effect of a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor on NSCLC colon pancreatic and breast tumor cells.

The sensitivities to erlotinib of 22 cell lines derived from NSCLC colon pancreatic and breast tumors was determined. The ability of 10 M erlotinib to inhibit the growth of these cell lines is shown in . It was found that these cell lines display a range of sensitivities to erlotinib and a maximal growth inhibition of greater than 50 was chosen as a cutoff criteria for indicating high sensitivity. Erlotinib s effects on the PI3K Akt mTOR pathway in this group of cell lines was analyzed. The three most sensitive cell lines H292 H358 and BxPC3 and three relatively insensitive cell lines H460 Calu6 and HCT 116 were selected for further investigation. Xenografts experiments have previously confirmed our in vitro classification of sensitivity for this group of cell lines data not shown and Thompson S. et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65 20 9455 9462 for H460 and Calu6 . Phosphorylation of S6 was chosen as a readout for the activity of mTOR. In the three sensitive epithelial cell lines it was found that erlotinib can efficiently down regulate the phosphorylation of pS6 while in the relatively insensitive cell lines which have undergone EMT a less pronounced down regulation of S6 phosphorylation was observed. These results are consistent with previous reports describing signaling pathways in other cell lines that are sensitive or relatively insensitive to EGFR inhibition Engelman J. A. et al. 2005 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102 3788 3793 Moasser M. M. et al. 2001 Cancer Res. 61 7184 718 .

Previous studies with glioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma have demonstrated the potential of combining EGFR inhibitors with rapamycin for these two cancer types Engelman J. A. et al. 2005 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102 3788 3793 Moasser M. M. et al. 2001 Cancer Res. 61 7184 718 Gemmill R. M. et al. 2005 Br. J. Cancer 92 2266 2277 Goudar R. K. et al. 2005 Mol. Cancer Ther. 4 101 112 . For example renal cell carcinomas harboring a mutation in the von Hippel Lindau gene VHL or those with tuberous sclerosis TSC mutations were sensitized to the combination of gefitinib and rapamycin Gemmill R. M. et al. 2005 Br. J. Cancer 92 2266 2277 . The combination of EGFR inhibitors with inhibitors of mTOR has also shown promise in glioblastoma a tumor type that is characterized by a very high frequency of truncating mutations for the EGFR EGFRvIII . The present inventors sought to determine if other tumor types that are not characterized by these groups of specific mutations might also respond to the combination of EGFR inhibitors with mTOR inhibitors. Cell lines derived from colon lung breast and pancreatic cancers were chosen for further analysis. The effect of low doses of rapamycin alone on the growth of the cell line panel was initially tested. shows the maximal inhibition of the cell lines to rapamycin. Several cell lines including H292 and BxPC3 show some growth inhibition by rapamycin alone. In all cell lines it was verified that rapamycin could effectively down regulate the phosphorylation of S6. A representative panel is shown in . These results demonstrate how inhibition of the mTOR pathway alone might not be sufficient to substantially affect cell proliferation.

The effect that combining rapamycin with erlotinib had on two criteria 1. potency and 2. intrinsic efficacy was determined. Our assessment of additivity synergy or antagonism was based on the Bliss additivism model described in the materials and methods section. This model was chosen over isobologram or combination index CI analyses as it would allow the evaluation of the nature of drug interactions even in cases where the maximal effects for rapamycin or erlotinib as single agents were low enough such that a reliable ICvalue could not be obtained. For cell lines that are relatively insensitive to erlotinib as a single agent the ICvalue is often greater than 10 M the solubility limit for the drug. In addition as both isobologram and combination index analyses are based upon a single criteria ICvalue and do not directly reflect variability within data they do not necessarily always indicate whether the extent of synergy is significant. The Bliss additivism model also allows us to evaluate changes in intrinsic efficacy. Both isobologram and CI analyses reflect only changes in potency but shifts in intrinsic efficacy also have the potential to be clinically meaningful. This approach has been described previously for high throughput studies involving drug combinations Borisy A. A. et al. 2003 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100 7977 7982 .

The data for combination of erlotinib with rapamycin are summarized in . The fractional increase in maximal intrinsic efficacy when erlotinib is combined with rapamycin is shown . The data are expressed as percentage decrease in cell growth above what would be expected if the combination was strictly additive in nature. Here Bliss 0 would indicate the combination was directly additive Bliss 0 would indicate the percentage increase in maximal inhibition above additivity synergy and Bliss

The effect of varying concentrations of rapamycin on growth inhibition in the presence and absence of 10 M erlotinib is shown in . Here Bliss represents the theoretical curve that should be expected if the combination of erlotinib and rapamycin was purely additive in nature. For the three most sensitive cell lines H292 H358 and BxPC3 Bliss analysis shows that erlotinib is exactly additive with rapamycin. This was confirmed by isobologram analysis of the data not shown . For the three cell lines selected above that are relatively insensitive to erlotinib H460 Calu6 and HCT 116 it was found that the combination shows synergy. This is reflected by both an increase in potency and a gain in maximal intrinsic efficacy. For example H460 cells show an increase in maximal efficacy of approximately 60 34 to 56 as well as a 10 fold shift in potency 267 M to 21 M when rapamycin is combined with erlotinib.

To investigate whether the above in vitro observations would extend to xenograft models in vivo the combination of erlotinib and rapamycin was tested in a Calu6 xenograft model. As predicted by the cell culture studies neither erlotinib or rapamycin had a substantial effect on inhibiting tumor growth as a single agent. However when these two targeted agents were combined they showed better than additive effects in inhibiting tumor growth. These results are shown in . On day 19 there is a 56 reduction in tumor growth with the erlotinib and rapamycin combination while there is no statistically significant reduction in tumor growth by either drug when they are administered as single agents. By day 19 tumors in control animals as well as tumors in animals treated with either erlotinib or rapamycin alone had grown to the point that animals had to be sacrificed while animals receiving the combination continued to survive for greater than 29 days data not shown .

Molecularly targeted agents acting on EGFR down modulate a number of different signaling cascades within the cell. The down regulation of any single pathway may be necessary but not sufficient to inhibit tumor cell growth. For EGFR inhibitors down regulation of the PI3K Akt mTOR pathway appears to track with sensitivity to growth inhibition. In cell lines that are relatively insensitive to blockade of the EGFR the mTOR pathway appears to be insufficiently inhibited. Mechanisms potentially leading to the sustained activity of the mTOR pathway include other growth factor receptors including IGF1R and FGFR specific mutations such as constitutively activating PI3K mutations or loss of PTEN activity. Therefore in cell lines that are relatively insensitive to EGFR kinase inhibitor intervention at multiple points may be necessary. The effects of combining the small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin were determined. It was found that cell lines that are relatively insensitive to erlotinib are sensitized to erlotinib by treatment with rapamycin. This is reflected in both a shift in potency and increase in maximal intrinsic activity.

The rapamycin and erlotinib combination was further characterized in a Calu6 xenograft model. Neither rapamycin or erlotinib showed significant reduction in tumor growth as single agents but show pronounced reduction in tumor growth in combination.

The above results provide an improved understanding of the mechanism of action of EGFR inhibitors to inhibitor tumor growth and will assist physicians in selecting patient populations who are most likely to benefit from combined therapy compared to single agent therapy.

In summary in this study it was demonstrated that a combination of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor can have a synergistic or supra additive inhibitory effect on the growth of human breast colon NSCL or pancreatic cancer cells. Thus mTOR inhibitors can act as agents that can sensitize tumor cells to the effects of EGFR kinase inhibitors.

The sensitivities to Compound A of 23 cell lines derived from ovarian NSCLC pancreatic and HNSCC tumors was determined. The ability of 20 M Compound A to inhibit the growth of these cell lines is shown in . A maximal growth inhibition of greater than 50 was chosen as the criteria for high sensitivity and all but one of these can be categorized as very sensitive. When combined with erlotinib Compound A synergistically inhibits cellular proliferation in the majority of cell lines tested. These findings are summarized in NSCLC and pancreatic and ovarian HNSCC and breast . In every cell line tested the combination improved maximal efficacy and where synergistic the combination resulted in a reduced EC50. Synergy was assessed using the bliss additivity model as previously described. In a panel of NSCLC and pancreatic cell lines the combination of compound A and erlotinib was synergistic in the four mesenchymal cell lines and additive in the four epithelial cell lines tested. The effect of varying concentrations of Compound A on growth inhibition in the presence and absence of erlotinib is shown in NSCLC and pancreatic . Here Bliss represents the theoretical curve that would be predicted if the combination of erlotinib and Compound A was purely additive. For the four mesenchymal NSCLC cell lines Bliss analysis indicates that the combination of erlotinib and Compound A is synergistic. This is reflected by both an increase in potency and a gain in maximal intrinsic efficacy. For the four epithelial NSCLC cell lines the combination is additive. In a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines the combination of erlotinib and Compound A was synergistic in the two mesenchymal cell lines and additive in the epithelial cell line tested . For the set of ovarian cancer and HNSCC cell lines tested representative dose response curves are shown . Within the panel of ovarian and HNSCC cell lines the combination of erlotinib and Compound A was synergistic in the majority of cell lines tested e.g. Igrov 1 Ovcar 3 HNSCC 1483 and additive in the remainder e.g. CA OV 3 although a strict correlation between mesenchymal phenotype and synergistic inhibition of proliferation was not observed. In no cell line tested was the combination of erlotinib and Compound A antagonistic.

In a set of NSCLC and pancreatic cell lines the combination of Compound A and erlotinib was shown to potentiate the induction of apoptosis to a greater degree than either single agent in all but one cell line tested . In that cell line A1165 the level of apoptosis was equal to that resulting from treatment with Compound A alone.

The combination enhanced apoptosis in both the mesenchymal and epithelial cell lines. Similarly in a set of three ovarian cell lines both erlotinib and Compound A increased apoptosis relative the DMSO treated cells and the combination of erlotinib and Compound A enhanced induction of apoptosis to a greater degree than either single agent .

Compound B has significant anti proliferative activity in a panel of HNSCC and ovarian cell lines . The ability of 10 M Compound B to inhibit the growth of these cell lines is shown in . A maximal growth inhibition of greater than 50 was chosen as the criteria for high sensitivity and all but two of these can be categorized as very sensitive. When combined with erlotinib Compound B synergistically inhibits cellular proliferation in the majority of cell lines tested. The effect of varying concentrations of Compound B on growth inhibition in the presence and absence of erlotinib is shown for four representative cell lines in . Synergy was determined using the Bliss model as described above. In no cell line tested was the combination of erlotinib and Compound B antagonistic.

The combination of erlotinib and Compound B was also shown to enhance apoptosis to a greater degree than either single agent in one ovarian and one HNSCC cell line . In these cell lines erlotinib and Compound B were each capable of inducing a modest increase in apoptosis relative to DMSO treated cells and the combination of the two targeted agents resulted in a greater than 20 fold induction of apoptosis.
