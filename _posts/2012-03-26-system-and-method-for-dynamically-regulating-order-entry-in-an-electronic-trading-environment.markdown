The present invention is directed to electronic trading. More specifically the present invention is directed towards dynamically regulating order entry in an electronic trading environment.

Trading methods have evolved from a manually intensive process to a technology enabled electronic platform. With the advent of electronic trading a user or trader can be in virtually direct contact with the market from practically anywhere in the world performing near real time transactions.

Electronic trading is generally based on a host exchange one or more computer networks and client devices. In general the host exchange includes one or more centralized computers to form the electronic heart. Its operations typically include maintaining an exchange order book that records unexecuted orders order matching providing price and order fill information and managing and updating a database that records such information. The host exchange is also equipped with an external interface that maintains uninterrupted contact to the client devices and possibly other trading related systems.

Using client devices traders link to the host exchange through one or more networks. A client device is a computer such as a personal computer laptop computer hand held computer and so forth that has network access. A network is a group of two or more computers or devices linked together which can be characterized by topology protocol and architecture. For example some market participants may link to the host through a direct network connection such as a T1 or ISDN. Some participants may link to the host exchange through direct network connections and through other common network components such as high speed servers routers and gateways. The Internet a well known collection of networks and gateways can be used to establish a connection between the client device and the host exchange. There are many different types of wired and wireless networks and combinations of network types known in the art that can link traders to the host exchange.

Sometimes on their machines traders use automated or semi automated trading tools that automatically or semi automatically send orders to the exchange. Such trading tools are usually provided to among other things facilitate fast and accurate order entry. For instance an automated tool might quickly calculate one or more order parameters such as order price or order quantity based on market conditions or some other reference condition and then automatically send an order with these parameters to an exchange for matching. According to many existing and popular exchanges today orders are electronically entered in an exchange order book in the sequence in which they are entered into the market a first in first out commonly referred to as FIFO matching system . Based on this sequence and the availability of market quantity orders are filled with priority given to the first order entered then the second next order entered and so forth.

Automated or semi automated trading tools often include spread trading tools. In general spread trading is the buying and or selling of one two or more tradeable objects the purpose of which is to capitalize on changes or movements in the relationships between the tradeable objects. The tradeable objects that are used to complete a spread are referred to as the outright markets or legs of the spread. A spread trade could involve buying tradeable objects buying and selling tradeable objects selling tradeable objects or some combination thereof.

As used herein the term tradeable object refers to anything that can be traded with a quantity and or price. It includes but is not limited to all types of traded events goods and or financial products which can include for example stocks options bonds futures currency and warrants as well as funds derivatives and collections of the foregoing and all types of commodities such as grains energy and metals. The tradeable object may be real such as products that are listed by an exchange for trading or synthetic such as a combination of real products that is created by the user. A tradeable object could actually be a combination of other tradeable objects such as a class of tradeable objects.

During spread trading a trader has typically a reason to believe that the conditions that will cause price movements in one tradeable object will also cause price movements in the other. Thus in other words spread trading may be thought of as the process of protecting a position where an investment is made by taking an offsetting position in a related product in order to reduce the risk of adverse price movements. For example a trader might simultaneously buy and sell two options of the same class at different strike prices and or expiration dates. Typically spread trading is used to describe a short position taken to offset a long position in the market. In other words when a long position is established with one order another order an offset order can be sent to fill the other leg s of the spread and offset the created position. A long position is one where a trader has purchased a tradeable object at a specific price with the intent of selling that tradeable object at a higher price. A short position is one where the trader has effectively sold the tradeable object first with the intent of buying it later at a lower price.

The automated spread trading tools typically allow a trader to adjust and control price levels at which offset orders are sent. However the existing offsets are user configurable and remain static unless a trader changes the entered values. To profit in electronic markets market participants must be able to assimilate large amounts of data and must react to the received data more quickly than other competing market participants. Thus it is desirable to offer tools that can assist a trader in trading in an electronic trading environment and help the trader make trades at the most favorable prices in a speedy and accurate manner.

It is beneficial to offer tools that can assist a trader in trading in an electronic trading environment. The example embodiments among other things are directed to trading a trading strategy such as a spread. One example method includes using a first pay up tick value to determine a first acceptable price level for an order such as an offset order associated with a spread. The first pay up tick can then be automatically modified to a second pay up tick in response to detecting a predefined condition. The predefined condition as will be described in greater detail below can be based on market data corresponding to one or more tradeable objects of the spread or yet some other data such as news. The method further includes using the second pay up tick value to determine a second acceptable price level for the offset order. Additional details related to the methods will be described in greater detail below.

While the example embodiments are described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications it should be understood that the example embodiments are not limited thereto. Other systems methods and advantages of the present embodiments will be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and description. It is intended that all such additional systems methods features and advantages be within the scope of the present invention and be protected by the accompanying claims.

As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art the example embodiments may be operated in an entirely software embodiment in an entirely hardware embodiment or in a combination thereof. However for sake of illustration the example embodiments are described in a software based embodiment which is executed on a computer device. As such the example embodiments take the form of a computer program product that is stored on a computer readable storage medium and is executed by a suitable instruction system in the computer device. Any suitable computer readable medium may be utilized including hard disks CD ROMs optical storage devices or magnetic storage devices for example.

In an electronic trading environment when an authorized trader selects a tradeable object the trader may access market data related to the selected tradeable object s . Referring to an example communication that might occur between an electronic exchange and a client entity in accordance with the example embodiments is shown. During a trading session market data in the form of messages may be relayed from a host exchange over communication links and to a client entity generally indicated as . The client entity may be a single client terminal that is used by a single trader or multiple client terminals corresponding to multiple traders associated with one or more trading groups. The client entity may include any computer that accesses one or more networks. For example the client entity can be a personal computer a laptop computer a hand held device and so on.

As illustrated in intermediate devices such as gateway s may be used to facilitate communications between the client entity and the host exchange . It should be understood that while illustrates the client entity communicating with a single host exchange in an alternative embodiment the client entity could establish trading sessions to more than one host exchange. Also it should be understood that information being communicated to and from the client entity and the exchange could be communicated via a single communication path.

The market data contains information that characterizes the tradeable objects including among other parameters order related parameters such as price and quantity and the inside market which represents the lowest sell price also referred to as the best or lowest ask price and the highest buy price also referred to as the best or highest bid price . In some electronic markets market data may also include market depth which generally refers to quantities available for trading the tradeable object at certain buy price levels and quantities available for trading the tradeable object at certain sell price levels.

In addition to providing the tradeable object s order book information electronic exchanges can offer different types of market information such as total traded quantity for each price level opening price last traded price last traded quantity closing price or order fill information. It should be understood that market information provided from an electronic exchange could include more or fewer items depending on the type of tradeable object or the type of exchange. Also it should be understood that the messages provided in the market data may vary in size depending on the content carried by them and the software at the receiving end may be programmed to understand the messages and to act out certain operations.

A trader may view the information provided from an exchange via one or more specialized trading screens created by software running on the client entity . Upon viewing the market information or a portion thereof a trader may wish to take actions such as send orders to an exchange cancel orders at the exchange or change order parameters for example. To do that the trader may input various commands or signals into the client entity . Upon receiving one or more commands or signals from the trader the client entity may generate messages that reflect the actions taken generally shown at . It should be understood that different types of messages or order types can be submitted to the host exchange all of which may be considered various types of transaction information. Once generated user action messages may be sent from the client entity to the host exchange over communication links and .

The client entity may use software that creates specialized interactive trading screens on the client entity . The trading screens enable traders to enter and execute orders obtain market quotes and monitor positions. The range and quality of features available to the trader on his or her screens varies according to the specific software application being run. In addition to or in place of the interactive trading screens the client entity may run automated non interactive types of trading applications.

A commercially available trading application that allows a user to trade in systems like those shown in and subsequent figures is X TRADER from Trading Technologies International Inc. of Chicago Ill. X TRADER also provides an electronic trading interface referred to as MD Trader in which working orders and bid ask quantities are displayed in association with a static price axis or scale. As mentioned above the scope of the example embodiments described herein are not limited by the type of terminal or device used and are not limited to any particular type of trading application. Portions of the X TRADER and the MD Trader style display are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 772 132 entitled Click Based Trading With Intuitive Grid Display of Market Depth filed on Jun. 9 2000 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 971 087 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 127 424 entitled Click Based Trading With Intuitive Grid Display of Market Depth and Price Consolidation filed on Oct. 5 2001 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 125 894 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 389 268 entitled Trading Tools for Electronic Trading filed on Apr. 19 2002 the contents of each are incorporated herein by reference.

Alternatively the example embodiments described herein may be a separate program from trading application but still stored in memory and executed on client device . In another alternative embodiment the preferred embodiments may be a program stored in memory and executed on a device other than client device . Example devices may include a gateway or some other well known intermediary device.

The example embodiments describe conditional pay up ticks that can be used by an automated spread trading tool to place orders based on spreads in an exchange order book. However as pointed out earlier the example embodiments described herein are not limited to automated spread trading tools and could be applied in relation to different trading tools having order entry systems that can determine prices for orders to be placed in the market. For example another type of trading tool that has an automated order entry system and may benefit using the preferred embodiments is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 284 584 now U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003 0236737 filed on Oct. 31 2002 and entitled System and Method for Automated Trading the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Also the example embodiments are not limited to spreads and could be easily applicable in relation to different trading strategies as well. One skilled in the art may readily adapt the example embodiments to work with this type of automated trading tool or yet some other type of trading tool or trading strategies using the teachings described herein.

To assist in understanding how an automated spread trading tool might work a general description is provided below. However an automated spread trading tool and its functions are described in greater detail and may be referenced in an already incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 137 979 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 437 325 filed on May 3 2002 and entitled System and Method for Performing Automatic Spread Trading. 

According to one embodiment of an automated spread trading tool a trader can select two or more individual tradeable objects underlying the spread referred to herein as legs of the spread. The automatic spread trading tool preferably generates a spread data feed based on information in the legs and based on spread setting parameters which are configurable by a user. The spread data feed is communicated to a graphical user interface manager where it is displayed in a spread window and where data corresponding to the legs of the spread may be displayed as well. At the terminal the user can enter orders in the spread window and the automated spread trading tool will automatically work the legs to achieve or attempt to achieve a desired spread. The spread is sometimes referred to herein as a synthetically created spread or a synthetic spread.

According to the example embodiments as the market conditions for each leg move an effective spread order price may be calculated. For example if market conditions for Leg change then an effective spread order price associated with order may be determined to reflect the new market conditions. Similarly if market conditions for Leg change then an effective spread order price associated with order may be determined. Using a conventional automated spread trading tool if the effective spread order price is different from the desired spread order price then the automated spread trading tool would move or re price the leg orders in an exchange order book to maintain the desired spread order price. In particular the leg order s would be deleted from the exchange and new leg order s would be sent to the exchange to maintain the desired spread price. There are other ways to change an order which may provide similar results such as sending a change order request message to an exchange at which the order was placed etc.

Alternatively effective prices of spread orders can be calculated continuously. For example the effective spread order prices can be calculated every second or yet using some other time interval. According to this alternative approach it is not necessary to monitor changes in market conditions before an effective spread order price is calculated. Similarly to the above embodiment however using a conventional automated spread trading tool if the effective price of the spread order is different from the desired price of the spread order then the automated spread trading tool would move or re price the leg orders in the exchange order book to maintain the desired spread price being sought.

In an alternative embodiment rather than calculating an effective spread order price the automated spread trading tool could calculate effective prices of orders in each leg of the spread. In particular as the market conditions for each leg move the effective prices of orders in the other legs may be calculated such that the desired spread price being sought by the trader can be maintained. For example if market conditions for Leg change then the effective prices of orders based on the market conditions in Leg such as order through order may be calculated to maintain the spread. If market conditions for Leg change then the effective prices of orders based on market conditions in Leg such as order through order may be calculated to maintain the spread. Further to maintain the desired spread price being sought using a conventional automated spread trading tool if the effective prices of the leg orders are different from the prices of the leg orders then the automated spread trading tool would move or re price the leg orders in an exchange order book. In particular the leg order s would be deleted from the exchange and a new leg order s at the effective price would be sent to the exchange.

Also in another alternative embodiment the effective prices of orders in the other legs can be continuously calculated such that the desired spread price being sought by the trader can be maintained. For example the effective leg order prices can be calculated every second or yet at different time intervals. Using this alternative approach it is not necessary to monitor changes in market conditions before the effective leg prices are calculated. Similarly to the above embodiment however to maintain the desired spread price being sought using a conventional automated spread trading tool if the effective prices of the leg orders are different from the prices of the leg orders then the automated spread trading tool would move or re price the leg orders in the exchange order book.

According to one example configuration of the spread when an order associated with one leg of a spread is filled an offset order is preferably sent to fill the other leg s at either the market price or as a limit order with pre defined pay up ticks. A market order is a bid order or an ask order that is executed at the best price currently available in the market. In one example embodiment the best prices may be those prices nearest to the inside market where the inside market is the highest bid price and the lowest ask price for the tradeable object being traded for which there is quantity in the market. A limit order is executed at a specific price as dictated by the trader regardless of whether it is the best price and or regardless of whether there is sufficient quantity available for an immediate fill.

In one example embodiment the user may configure the automatic spreader to use either of these two offset techniques but alternatively other offset techniques known in the art of trading could be implemented as well. In one example embodiment a trader may set up spread order parameters using a spread configuration window. The spread configuration window may include an Offset With field and the field may be used to determine whether quantities are entered as market orders or limit orders. In such an embodiment the Offset With field may enable a trader to select either market orders or limit orders. When the market orders are selected then quantities will be entered into the market as market orders. If the Offset With field is set to limit orders then quantities will be entered as limit orders. The spread configuration window could also include a Pay up Tick field and the trader could use the Pay up Tick field to define the number of ticks that a trader is willing to pay beyond the basis of the limit price to complete a spread or in other words an acceptable range of prices for the offset order. In one example embodiment the basis price of the limit order may be based on a price that will achieve the desired spread. Alternatively the basis price for limit orders could be based on the inside market either the best offer in the case of a bid or the best bid in the case of an offer .

Using pay up ticks to establish the price of the limit order the pay up tick value is added to the basis for a buy order and subtracted from the basis of the sell order. In other words the pay up ticks allow a trader to set a level of tolerance with respect to the filling of an additional order. In one example embodiment this tolerance can be defined by a user specifying a number of ticks. Also as will be described in greater detail below this tolerance may be set dynamically based on user defined conditions.

For example when quoting one leg of a two legged spread after the working order is filled in the quoted leg the automatic spreader can send an offset market order to fill the other leg. If the automatic spreader is quoting both legs of a two legged spread after one of the working orders in one of the legs is filled the automatic spreader may send an offset market order to the other leg and then may attempt to delete the working order that was being quoted in the other leg. If some or all of that working order s quantity gets filled before it can be deleted in one example embodiment the automatic spreader may send a corresponding offset market order to the other leg. This situation is commonly referred to as a double fill scenario. Alternatively the automatic spreader can be set to first delete the working order being quoted in the other leg before sending the offset market order. Different embodiments are possible as well.

When a partial quantity is filled in one of these legs the spread ratio settings are preferably used to determine the quantity of the offsetting order that is sent into the second leg s market. For example suppose a trader is working a 10 by 30 spread where 1 3 corresponds to a spread ratio. Let s now assume that a trader places a first order having an order quantity of 10 at an electronic exchange. Let s now assume that two of the 10 working quantity are filled on the first leg 20 of the working quantity . An equal percentage 20 of the offset quantity may be sent into the market for the second leg. For the above example a quantity of six 20 of 30 determined based on 1 3 ratio would be sent into the second leg s market and the quantity of the spread would be adjusted based on the partially filled quantity. If the quantity or spread units are not whole numbers the automatic spreader can round up down or truncate the quantity depending on how it is programmed.

Let s assume that a trader is working a spread for tradeable objects A and B and buys the actively quoted quantity for tradeable object A and consequently now wants to sell tradeable object B in order to complete the spread or in other words offset the position established in relation to the tradeable object A. shows two example market depth snapshots corresponding to the tradeable objects A and B. Now let s assume that the desired spread value can be achieved by buying tradeable object A at a price of 109300 so that the price of 109300 is the basis for calculating the limit order. Let s also assume that the Pay up Tick field for that leg contains a value of 0. According to such configuration a limit order will be entered at a price of 109300 which is the equivalent to the basis price plus zero ticks. It should be understood that the pay up ticks can be used in relation to a minimum price movement as defined by the exchange in a tradeable object. However a tick can also refer to a larger or smaller amount than the minimum price movement. For example the minimum price movement in a eCBOT for the ten year future is 0.5 tick.

Then consequently if the buy order fills in relation to the tradeable object A an offsetting order here the sell order for the tradeable object B can be automatically entered at the calculated price. Let s now assume that the auto spreader can achieve a spread by selling tradeable object B at the best bid and a pay up tick is set to 1. In such an embodiment the auto spreader will submit the sell order for the tradeable object B at the price of 111260 which is the best bid price corresponding to the market price of the tradeable object B minus 1 tick. If there is sufficient quantity available to complete the spread at a price of 111260 or higher that quantity may be filled immediately. If no such quantity is available the limit order will not immediately be filled but may instead remain entered at 111260 until sufficient quantity becomes available. In addition if the trader sets the Pay up Tick value to 1 and a limit order is entered at a price that is 1 ticks from the basis price but quantity is available at a price better than where the limit order was entered the order may get filled at that better price. The Pay up Tick feature therefore puts a limit on how far away from the basis price determined for a spread order the trader is willing to allow an offset order or any spread order to be filled.

According to the example embodiment described above using positive pay up ticks the auto spreader offsets orders on a bid to bid or ask to ask basis which means for example in relation to a buy order entered for one leg on a bid side of the market that the sell order for the other leg will also be entered on the bid side of the market corresponding to the second leg. However there could be times when a trader may wish to achieve a bid to ask or ask to bid spread such that for example when placing a buy order in relation to one leg on a bid side of the first market the sell order will be entered on the ask side of the second market or vice versa. A trader could achieve such a configuration by defining negative pay up ticks. Referring back to let s assume that the auto spreader places a buy order in relation to the tradeable object A at a price of 109300 and the sell order of the tradeable object B is configured with a negative pay up tick of 1. Now let s assume that based on the spread configuration the sell order is to be entered at the best bid price in the market corresponding to the tradeable object B. However using the negative pay up ticks the auto spreader will modify the price corresponding to the sell order and will enter the sell order at 111270 the best bid 111265 minus negative 1 tick which is 111265 plus 1 tick thus submitting the order on the ask side.

According to example embodiments that will be described in greater detail below the auto spreader application could allow a trader to define and use conditional pay up ticks. Using conditional pay up ticks a trader could define pay up tick value s to be used in relation to one or more legs of the spread and the auto spreader could dynamically change the pay up tick value s based on and upon detecting any user defined conditions. For example when one or more conditions apply the auto spreader application could switch from using positive or zero pay up ticks to using negative pay up ticks or vice versa. Alternatively different values corresponding to positive or zero pay up ticks and negative pay up ticks could be applied to spread orders based on applicable conditions. It should be understood that many different conditions could be used such as market related conditions trader performance based conditions or yet some other conditions that are based on data from outside sources such as news or certain numbers such as announcement of unemployment numbers. For example one or more conditions that can be used to dynamically change values for pay up ticks could be based on market volatility. In such an embodiment a higher pay up tick value could be used upon detecting a highly volatile market where the market volatility could be defined by the user as well and a lower pay up tick value or no pay up tick value could be used upon detecting a non volatile market. The conditions could also be based on one or more equations including a plurality of user defined variables.

According to one example embodiment a user could configure conditions as well as values to be used in relation to pay up ticks via an external interface such as a spreadsheet. In such an embodiment a user could easily change any variables and values associated with the conditions and pay up tick via the spreadsheet. However it should be understood that different applications other than spreadsheets could be used as well to configure and change conditions and the corresponding pay up tick values. It should be understood that any desirable data exchange protocol could be used to embed information from the third party software such as a spreadsheet to the auto spreader application or to another graphical user interface that is used to define conditions to be used by the auto spreader application. For example when the Microsoft Windows is used as the third party software Microsoft OLE 2.0 may be used to perform these functions. Microsoft OLE 2.0 may be used to provide a link between any filter condition and one or more cells from a Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet. Data exchange protocols as well as embedding and linking techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. It should be understood that when an equation is used to define a condition every time a value of one of the equation variables changes the spreadsheet application or any other third party software may dynamically calculate a new value to be used in relation to determining pay up tick values.

It should be understood that an individual user could uniquely set conditions and pay up tick values to suit his or her individual trading strategies. A trader could program the conditions and applicable pay up tick values in a variety of ways and at any time such as before trading or on the fly. Alternatively a system administrator who oversees a number of traders may set up a number of conditions and associated pay up tick values for a group of traders or for individual traders. In such an embodiment when a trader in that group inputs a new order the auto spreader can monitor data associated with the conditions and then dynamically apply pre configured pay up tick values to the spread orders based on the applicable conditions.

The Spread Name provides the name of the spread and or the names of underlying tradeable objects being traded as a spread e.g. TTSIM D FGBL SEP06 and TTSIM D FGBL DEC 06. The legs of the spread are also displayed in the Leg fields . Also a trader could personalize the spread by renaming the spread and or the legs to have any desired name. The spread window also includes Inside Slop and Outside Slop parameters . The Inside Slop and Outside Slop parameters prevent continuous re quoting of working orders associated with the spread and indicate the point at which the working bids offers will be readjusted in the market to satisfy the spread value. The Leg Color ID parameter allows a trader to use the color selector to identify working spreads and corresponding leg orders in the trading interface. As will be described in greater detail below a trader could also select specific colors or specific graphical indicators to be used in relation to spread orders that were generated using conditional pay up ticks. The Base Spread On parameter allows a trader to select a set of prices to be used for trading spreads. As shown in when the Implied Spread Prices are selected the trading interface for trading the specified spread will display the actual implied prices of the spread. Then if the Net Change is selected the trading interface will display the spread prices as a net change from a previous settlement price or yet some other prices specified by a trader.

The Customer Account field allows a trader to access the customer account for use in relation to trading the spread. The Active Quoting enables a trader to select a leg of the spread that the auto spreader will quote in. If the checkbox is not selected the auto spreader will send an order for the unselected leg when the other leg is filled. However alternatively it should be understood that the auto spreader could simultaneously quote in both legs as well. When the Adjust for Market Depth is checked the auto spreader will use market depth to calculate spread pricing. If the Adjust for Market Depth is unchecked the pricing for the spread may be adjusted based on the best bid offer in the market. The Offset With field allows a trader to define a type of orders to be used in relation to offset orders. As shown in the offset orders could be limit orders. However different order types could be used as well such as market orders for instance.

The Pay up Ticks fields can be used in conjunction with the Offset With filed when the limit orders are selected. The Pay up Ticks fields allow a trader to select two different types of pay up ticks. According to one embodiment the pay up ticks could be static and a trader could select this type of pay up ticks by defining values in relation to the Numerical fields in the Pay up Ticks field . The numerical values defined for the static pay up ticks could be positive or negative. The spread configuration window also allows a trader to enable conditional pay up ticks that could be used in relation to one or more legs of the spread. When the conditional pay up ticks are selected another graphical interface such as the one illustrated in can be automatically activated to enable a trader to define conditions as well as other settings to be used in relation to conditional pay up ticks. It should be understood that a trader could both both the static pay up ticks as well as the conditional pay up ticks. In such an embodiment static pay up ticks could be used in relation to spread orders until one or more selected conditions associated with the conditional pay up ticks are satisfied.

The Spread Ratio parameter indicates the quantity ratio of each spread leg in relation to other legs. A negative sign before a number in the Spread Ratio field may indicate a short leg. The Spread Multiplier parameters may be used to equate the cash value of inter product spreads in order to calculate the spread value. When the Use Cancel Replace rather than Change field is enabled the auto spreader will send a cancel replace orders rather than attempting to change the pending orders. The Price Reasonability Check in Leg field may be used to enable the auto spreader to check price reasonability on a leg before the trade is submitted to an exchange. Such functionality may be required for certain exchanges before a trade is accepted in the market. While the spread configuration window shows the parameters described above it should be understood that different parameters could be defined as well in relation to the spread.

As shown in a trader could enter different pay up tick configurations in relation to each leg of the spread. A user can use the Select Condition field to select a condition that will be used to activate the conditional pay up tick values. For example a condition could be based on market volatility and different conditions could be created for different levels of market volatility. Also while a user may select a single condition using the Select Condition field the selected condition may be associated with more than one sub condition the satisfaction of which may trigger activation of the corresponding condition. Also it should be understood that a user could select multiple conditions to be used during a trading session. In such an embodiment different pay up tick values could be used depending on which condition is triggered.

The Create Modify Condition field can be used to define new conditions or to specify modify certain parameters associated with the currently existing conditions. For example a pull down menu could be provided in relation to the Create Modify Condition field to enable selection or creating of a new condition or modifying the existing conditions. However different selection options could be provided as well. Once a user selects one of the options one or more other interfaces could be activated and the interface s could be used to create new conditions or to modify certain parameters of the existing conditions. For example in relation to conditions that are based on market volatility a user could create conditions corresponding to new market volatility levels or modify market volatility levels corresponding to the existing conditions. The market volatility levels could be defined based on how many ticks the market moves per second or yet based on some other definitions.

According to one example embodiment some conditions could be based on one or more equations. The Create Link Equation field allows a trader to create equations or link them from other applications. It should be understood that a trader could also link any set of instructions or a computer program via the Create Link Equation field to be used as a condition. Different configurations are possible as well.

In addition to defining conditions a user could define other parameters that could also be used in the process of determining if the conditional pay up ticks should be activated. For example the additional parameters could be based on current market conditions such as the quantity available in the market. According to one example embodiment illustrated in a user could configure a quantity ratio using the Quantity Ratio fields and a minimum quantity using the Minimum Quantity fields . As shown in a user could enable disable each function for the respective legs of the spread using selection boxes and . Then values for the quantity ratios and minimum quantities could be defined via the fields and . As an example lets assume that a trader sets the quantity ratio to 2.5 and the minimum quantity to 100. In this case if the tradeable object is an offsetting tradeable object to be bought then the best ask best bid quantity ratio would have to be 2.5 or higher and the best ask quantity needs to be greater than 100.

Finally when one or more conditions and or parameters are selected a trader could define pay up tick values via the Pay Up Tick Value fields . Alternatively when a trader selects a condition the Pay Up Tick Value fields could be automatically populated with the preconfigured values corresponding to the selected condition s . According to one example embodiment a trader could define and activate both the statically defined numerical pay up ticks and conditional pay up ticks so that the statically defined numerical pay up ticks can be used until one or more selected conditions are met. Similarly when the conditions are no longer satisfied the auto spreader application can automatically revert back to using statically defined numerical pay up ticks. For example a trader may wish to configure static pay up ticks to use positive pay up tick values and then use negative pay up ticks when one or more conditions are satisfied.

According to one example embodiment a trader may submit and view working order indicators via a trading interface such as the MD Trader style display described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 772 132 and incorporated by reference above. According to one example embodiment when conditional pay up ticks are activated and used to generate an offsetting order a working order indicator that appears in the trading interface or in relation to some other interface may be displayed with a distinct color shape or yet some other distinguishing characteristic so that a trader can have a visual confirmation of the conditional pay up tick action. While visual representation for offsetting orders that were generated using conditional pay up tick values is one possible implementation a trader could also select a distinct sound to be played when conditional pay up tick order is placed. It should be understood that a trader could configure different colors and or sounds to be used in relation to different conditions.

Referring to at step a condition is defined to be used in relation to a spread. According to one example embodiment the condition can be defined by a trader. However the condition could be selected automatically from a pool of user defined conditions while the automatic selection of the specific condition could be time based. The condition could define one or more parameters to be monitored and when the defined parameters are detected the condition can be consequently triggered.

At step the auto spreader uses a first pay up tick value in relation to spread orders. The first pay up tick value can be used to determine a first acceptable price level or range for one or more orders related to the spread and the selection of orders in relation to which the first pay up tick value is used may depend on user configuration. The first pay up tick value can be positive negative or zero.

At step the condition is detected based on monitoring of data associated with the defined condition. It should be understood that different applications in communication with the auto spreader can be used to monitor data associated with the conditions and to detect when the condition is activated. Alternatively the auto spreader can be used to perform this function.

At step upon the condition is detected the first pay up tick value is automatically modified to a second pay up tick value. Then the second pay up tick value can be used to determine a second acceptable price level for one or more spread orders.

It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that methods involved in the system and method for using conditional pay up ticks in relation to spread orders or yet some other orders generated by the automatic or semi automatic applications may be embodied in a computer program product that includes one or more computer readable media. For example a computer readable medium can include a readable memory device such as a hard drive device a CD ROM a DVD ROM or a computer diskette having computer readable program code segments stored thereon. The computer readable medium can also include a communications or transmission medium such as a bus or a communication link either optical wired or wireless having program code segments carried thereon as digital or analog data signals.

The claims should not be read as limited to the described order or elements unless stated to that effect. Therefore all embodiments that come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto are claimed as the invention.
