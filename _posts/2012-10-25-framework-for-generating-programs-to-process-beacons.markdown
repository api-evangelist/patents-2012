title: Framework for generating programs to process beacons
abstract: A method receives a specification for processing beacons. The beacons are associated with an event occurring at a client while a user is interacting with a web application and include unstructured data. The method parses the specification to determine an object model including objects determined from the specification where different specifications are parsed into a format of the object model. A generator is determined and each generator is configured to process the format of the object model to generate a different type of target program to process the beacons and multiple generators can process different specifications that are parsed into the format of the object model. The method runs the generator with the object model to generate a target program configured to identify the beacons for the specification, determine unstructured data in the beacons that were specified in the specification, and transform the unstructured data into structured data.
