This patent is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 12 334 169 filed Dec. 12 2008 entitled Methods and Apparatus to Pre Qualify User Communities for Communication Services which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to user communities and more particularly to methods and apparatus to pre qualify user communities for communication services.

Access networks and or systems using digital subscriber line DSL technologies are commonly utilized to provide communication services to customer premises. DSL technologies enable service providers to utilize telephone lines to connect customers to for example a high data rate broadband Internet network a broadband service and or broadband content. An example telephone line uses twisted pair copper wire to provide Plain Old Telephone System POTS services.

A communication company and or service provider may utilize a plurality of DSL modems implemented by a DSL access multiplexer DSLAM and or a video ready access device VRAD at a central office CO a remote terminal RT or a serving area interface SAI to provide DSL communication services to a plurality of customer premises DSL modems located at respective customer premises. In general a DSLAM VRAD receives broadband service content for a subscriber from for example a backbone server. A CO DSL modem at the DSLAM VRAD forms from the content a downstream DSL signal to be transmitted to a customer premises DSL modem via a telephone line that electrically couples the CO DSL modem at the SAI RT or CO to the customer premises DSL modem. Likewise the CO DSL modem receives an upstream DSL signal from the customer premises DSL modem via the corresponding subscriber s telephone line and the DSLAM VRAD provides the data received via the upstream DSL signal to the backbone server. One or more characteristics of the subscriber s telephone line determine what type s and or speed s of DSL services can be supported by the subscriber s telephone line.

Example methods and apparatus to pre qualify user communities for communication services are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes configuring a first remote network demarcation associated with a first loop to a loop back state interrogating the first loop to determine a first parameter representative of the first loop configuring a second remote network demarcation associated with a second loop to the loop back state interrogating the second loop to determine a second parameter representative of the second loop and compiling a report based on the first and second parameters the report containing a value that represents a degree to which a communication service can be provided to a user community associated with the first and second loops.

A disclosed example system includes a first customer premises associated with a first subscriber line and having a first demarcation point a second customer premises associated with a second subscriber line and having a second demarcation point a first test module to interrogate the first subscriber line to determine a first parameter representative of the first subscriber line a second test module to interrogate the second subscriber line to determine a second parameter representative of the second subscriber line and a pre qualification server. The pre qualification server to configure the first network demarcation point associated with the first subscriber line to a loop back state configure the second network demarcation point associated with the second subscriber line to the loop back state and generate a report based on the first and second parameters the report containing a value that represents a degree to which a communication service can be provided to a user community associated with the first and second subscriber lines.

Another disclosed example method includes installing evaluation software on a computer communicatively coupled to a customer premises equipment CPE modem the evaluation software to configure the CPE modem to a test state interacting with the CPE modem while in the test state to interrogate a wire associated with the first CPE modem to determine a first parameter representative of the wire and generating a report based on the first parameter the report containing a value that represents a degree to which a communication service can be provided to a user community associated with the wire.

Yet another disclosed example method includes prompting a user for permission to test whether a wire associated with the user is capable to support a communication service configuring a CPE modem associated with the user to a test state when the permission is received wherein the CPE modem while in the test state is to test the wire for the communication service presenting a first value representative of a result of the test to the user and prompting the user to provide a second value representative of an interest in the communication service.

In the interest of brevity and clarity throughout the following disclosure references will be made to an example access network of . However the methods and apparatus described herein to pre qualify user communities for communication services are applicable to other types of access networks and or communication systems constructed using other network technologies topologies and or protocols. Other example systems include but are not limited to those associated with public switched telephone network PSTN systems public land mobile network PLMN systems e.g. cellular wireless distribution systems wired or cable distribution systems coaxial cable distribution systems Ultra High Frequency UHF Very High Frequency VHF radio frequency systems satellite or other extra terrestrial systems cellular distribution systems power line broadcast systems fiber optic networks passive optical network PON systems and or any combination and or hybrid of these devices systems and or networks.

While in the illustrated example of the DSLAMs VRADs are implemented at the CO any of the DSLAMs VRADs may be additionally or alternatively implemented at an RT at an SAI and or at any other location between the CO and the customer premises . In such instances a fiber optic cable not shown may be used for example to communicatively couple the remotely located DSLAM VRAD to the CO .

In the illustrated example of the DSLAM provides DSL services to the CPE DSL modems via respective subscriber lines and . Subscriber lines are sometimes also referred to in the industry as wires wire pairs subscriber loops and or loops. While throughout this disclosure reference is made to the example loops of a loop e.g. any of the example loops used to provide a DSL service to a customer premises location e.g. any of the locations may include and or be constructed from one or more segments of twisted pair telephone wire e.g. any combination of a feeder one F1 cable a feeder two F2 cable a feeder three F3 cable a feeder four F4 cable a distribution cable a drop cable and or customer premises wiring terminals and or distributions points e.g. an RT an SAI a serving terminal a vault a pedestal and or any other type s of wiring distribution points . Such segments of twisted pair telephone wire may be spliced and or connected end to end and or may be connected at only one end thereby creating one or more bridged taps. Regardless of the number type s gauge s and or topology of twisted pair telephone wires used to construct the example loops they will be referred to herein in the singular form but it will be understood that the term loop may refer to one or more twisted pair telephone wire segments and may include one or more bridged taps.

As commonly used in the industry the term network demarcation denotes a location and or device where cabling and or equipment associated with a service provider e.g. associated with the CO and or the DSLAMs VRADs is physically electrically and or communicatively coupled to cabling and or equipment associated with a customer premises a subscriber a user and or a customer e.g. any of the example customer premises . Such subscriber cabling and or equipment are often owned by the customer but may in some instances be owned leased and or otherwise provided by the service provider. Typically a network demarcation unit e.g. a network interface device NID is located at the network demarcation e.g. on the outside of an exterior wall of the customer premises to implement the physical electrical and or communicative coupling between the subscriber and service provider sides of the network demarcation. For instance the example NID of contains a first set of screw terminals and or jacks to couple the loop to the NID and contains a second set of screw terminals and or jacks to couple subscriber cabling to the NID . The example subscriber cabling electrically couples the CPE DSL modem to the NID and thus to the loop . Example NIDs and likewise contain screw terminals and or jacks as described for the NID . In a conventional and or traditional NID such as the example NID of a jumper and or wire electrically couples the two sets of cabling and across the NID .

To permit probing interrogation sensing and or any other form s of testing of the example loops and from the example CO the example NIDs and of are enhanced NIDs eNIDs . The example eNIDs and of each include a switch to allow the loops and to be looped back at the eNIDs and respectively. The example switches of may be used to configure a loop back for an individual loop and or to configure a loop back using an additional loop. In general the type of loop back realized by the example switches at any particular eNID depends on how conductors of the loops and and conductors of the subscriber wiring and are connected to respective terminals of the example switches . The example switch of the example eNID of can be controlled configured and or positioned to a electrically couple a first conductor of the example loop to a second conductor of the loop or b electrically couple the first and second conductors of the loop to respective conductors of the subscriber wiring . The example switch of the example eNID of can be controlled configured and or positioned to a electrically couple conductors of the example loop to respective conductors of another subscriber loop or b electrically couple the conductors of the loop to respective conductors of subscriber wiring . In some examples all NIDs within a geographic area are eNIDs. Additionally or alternatively a statistically representative set of NIDS within a geographic area implement eNIDs. In such examples test data collected using the associated representative set of loops can be used to infer project and or otherwise construe the ability of the geographic area as a whole to support the communication service.

To allow the example switches to be remotely configurable and or controllable each of the example eNIDs and of includes a switch controller . The example switch controllers of receive one or more values parameters and or signals from any type of network management server NMS via the example DSLAM and a corresponding loop . The received values parameters and or signals indicate to a particular switch controller whether the eNID associated with that switch controller is to be configured in a loop back state. In some examples telemetry signals are used to provide loop back state information to the switch controllers via the loops and .

To test the ability of the loops to support a communication service the example DSLAMs VRADs of implement any number and or type s of line test modules three of which are designated at reference numerals and . Using any number and or type s of device s component s transmitter s receiver s method s algorithm s rule s procedure s and or logic the example line test modules of probe interrogate sense and or otherwise test the example loops by for example sending and or receiving one or more test signals on a looped back subscriber line . Based on the transmitted and or received test signal s the example test modules determine one or more test results values and or parameters that represent and or characterize the loops and or that represent and or characterize the ability of the loops to support a particular communication service. Example test results values and or parameters include but are not limited to a supportable communication service type a supportable communication service data rate a useable frequency band whether bridged taps are present loop lengths wire gauge s attenuation versus frequency data amount of noise and or interference that is present etc.

To test pre qualify and or otherwise determine whether a communication service could be reliably efficiently and or cost effectively provided to a user community at a desired level of customer satisfaction the example access network of includes a pre qualification server . As used herein the term user community refers to any plurality of customer premises persons users and or subscribers associated with a particular geographic area and or associated with a particular communication distribution point. Example geographic areas include but are not limited to a neighborhood a street a telephone exchange an area code a portion of a city a city a zip code a postal code a county a region a country and or any combination thereof. Example communication distribution points include but are not limited to a DSLAM VRAD a cable head end a CO an RT a SAI an intermediate office a serving office and or any combination thereof.

The example pre qualification server of assesses the ability of the example access network to provide one or more communication services to a user community. For example the example pre qualification server can be used to assess estimate and or otherwise analyze whether it is feasible reasonable and or appropriate to begin marketing selling promoting and or deploying VDSL services to a user community associated with the example CO . In particular the example pre qualification server assesses the ability of the example loops to support the VDSL services. The example pre qualification server of assesses the loops by a remotely controlling the eNIDs and into a loop back state via the example NMS and b controlling the test modules to test the loops and . The loops and may be tested sequentially and or in parallel. The time s of day s at and or during which testing is performed may be selected a priori to minimize the interruptions of existing services and or selected by sensing when an existing service is inactive and only performing testing during such inactive periods. Based on the test results determined by the example test modules the example pre qualification server of generates a pre qualification report that represents characterizes and or reflects how practical it is to deploy a particular communication service to the user community and or a degree to which a particular communication service may be provided to and or operated for the user community. The example pre qualification server compiles the test results from multiple loops to generate the pre qualification report. In the illustrated example of the generated pre qualification report is provided to a sales and or marketing server and or organization . An example pre qualification test report is described below in connection with .

An example metric that may be used to represent the ability of a user community to support a particular service for example a 50 Mbps VDSL service and or represent a degree to which the service may be provided to and or operator for the user community is the number and or percentage of the loops that do not appear to be currently able to support the service. That is the number and or percentage of loops that have exceptions which may currently preclude deployment of the communication service. For example if less than 10 percent of the loops would require maintenance and or repair for example to remove bridge taps and or to reduce interference noise marketing and or sales organizations can widely market sell and or promote the service to the user community. If between 10 and 30 of the loops may require maintenance and or repair the service can be marketed sold and or promoted on a limited basis depending on the availability of adequate numbers of service technicians to diagnose and or troubleshoot service problems that arise during installations and or in response to customer calls. When more than 30 of the loops may require maintenance and or repair it may be more cost effective to delay marketing selling and or promoting the service until adequate remediation of the loop plant is performed. If such loop plant remediation is not performed up front customer satisfaction and or revenues may be negatively impacted. An example process that may be carried out to pre qualify a user community for a community service is described below in connection with .

The device s component s transmitter s receiver s method s algorithm s rule s procedure s and or logic implemented by the example test modules of to test characterize and or pre qualify the loops for a communication service can be progressively improved as the communication service is installed for different user communities. For example pre qualification test results determined for a first user community can be compared with actual installation experiences for the first user community to identify enhancements refinements and or improvements to the pre qualification process es implemented by the example pre qualification server and the test modules to pre qualify one or more loops associated with a second user community for the communication service. For example if it was empirically observed that more loops of the first user community were unable to support the communication service than the number estimated by the example pre qualification server one or more threshold s method s algorithm s rule s procedure s and or logic used by the example test modules can be modified and or adjusted accordingly.

In addition to or alternative to the automated testing and or pre qualification of a user community for a communication service described above the example pre qualification server of can interact with and or utilize a user customer and or subscriber to assess whether it is feasible to install and or deploy a particular communication service for that user . While such testing is performed responsive to individual users the results of such testing can be combined with a testing performed for and or by other individual users and or b automated testing results to pre qualify a user community at large for the service.

The example user of may learn about and or be notified of new and or upgraded communication service s via any number and or type s of means. For example the user may be receive a flyer via postal mail may receive an email and or be presented with a webpage. Such notifications can present information e.g. cost features etc. regarding the new and or upgraded communication service s provide information regarding how the user can learn more about the new and or upgraded communication service s and or provide information regarding how to test or assess whether they are able to receive the new and or upgraded communication service s at their respective customer premises . In response to any such notification s the example user of downloads and installs evaluation software on any type of personal computer PC that is communicatively coupled to their respective CPE DSL modem . The example evaluation software of may be downloaded from for example the pre qualification server via the VRAD the loop and the CPE DSL modem . In some examples the example evaluation software is implemented with a web based graphical user interface GUI and implements one or more web based application programming interfaces APIs to interact with the CPE DSL modem and or the example pre qualification server .

When execution of the evaluation software is activated and or started on the example PC the example evaluation software of collects from the pre qualification server information e.g. cost features etc. regarding the new and or upgraded communication service s and presents the collected information to the user via for example a web based GUI. The presented web based GUI includes one or more user interface elements such as buttons check boxes menus etc. which allow the user to indicate and or provide permission for the CPE DSL modem and the example pre qualification server to a temporarily interrupt one or more existing services present on the loop and to test the loop and b determine whether the loop is capable to support the new and or upgraded communication service s .

After receiving permission from the user the example evaluation software of activates a test module implemented by the example CPE DSL modem . Using any number and or type s of device s component s transmitter s receiver s method s algorithm s rule s procedure s and or logic the example test module of probes interrogates senses and or otherwise tests the example loop by for example exchanging one or more test signals with the example test module via the loop . Based on the exchanged test signal s the example test module and or the example test module determine one or more test results values and or parameters that represent and or characterize the loop and or that represent and or characterize the ability of the loop to support one or more communication services. Example test results values and or parameters include but are not limited to an estimated data rate a useable frequency band whether bridged taps are present loop lengths wire gauge s attenuation versus frequency data amount of noise and or interference that is present etc.

When testing of the loop is completed the example evaluation software of restores the previous configuration of the example CPE DSL modem to restore any existing communication service s that were interrupted by the testing of the loop . The example evaluation software presents one or more results of the testing to the user via for example a web based GUI. Example presented results include but are not limited to an indication of whether the new and or upgraded communication service s can be supported by the loop and if supported how the user can request and or make further inquiry about the new and or upgraded communication service s . In some examples the presented results include a uniform resource link URL that allows the user to proceed to a customer service and or order entry website which allows the user to request activation and or installation of the new and or upgraded communication service s . The presented web based GUI also includes one or more user interface elements such as buttons check boxes menus etc. which prompt the user to indicate and or provide how interested they are in subscribing to the new and or upgraded communication service s . Service interest information collected by the evaluation software from the user is provided to the pre qualification server via for example the CPE DSL modem the loop and the VRAD .

Based on the testing performed on the loop and or the collected interest information the example pre qualification server of generates a customer premises evaluation report that includes one or more results of the testing and or the interest level provided by the user . An example user evaluation report is described below in connection with . Based on the example test the example pre qualification server also updates a market analysis report and or a pre qualification test report.
