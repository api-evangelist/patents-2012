This application relates to co pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13 444 691 filed Apr. 11 2012 entitled SYSTEM METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR GENERATION OF LOCAL CONTENT CORPUS which is also incorporated herein by reference.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright or mask work protection. The copyright or mask work owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright or mask work rights whatsoever.

This disclosure relates generally to online search and social media. More particularly embodiments disclosed herein relate to a system method and computer program product for discovering curating and editing online local content.

Social media and Internet technologies have enabled any computer user local organizations and small business to easily publish content. Blogging Twitter and Facebook have become the main channels for user content publication. Local organizations libraries and local businesses have transitioned their communications from physical media newspapers physical bulletin boards fliers and Yellow Pages to informational websites and more recently social media outlets to attempt to connect with their audiences.

Although information publication has become relatively easy due to web publication technologies reaching geographically local users continues to be difficult due to the content discovery mechanism driven by Internet search engines.

A search engine indexes collects parses and stores data to facilitate fast access and relevant information retrieval. Search engines incorporate interdisciplinary concepts from linguistics cognitive psychology mathematics informatics physics and computer science.

Today leading search engine providers use a variety of algorithms to index and retrieve information based on user keyword search. To enable a general search service applicable to all web users these search engines index and rank content based on general mathematical properties including web page link analysis in order to determine the likely most relevant content based on key words provided by the user. The number of external links to a given web page affects the ranking of the web page within search results. Users are presented content in rank order based on the score determined by the search engine s indexing algorithms.

Unfortunately traditional Internet search must index an extremely large number of web pages and this limits the type of algorithms that can be applied. These algorithms tend to be extremely general and large amounts of content that might be relevant do not appear within given search results as they are not linked by other sites on the web. Due to the fact content that is highly geographical topical local content competes with the entire body of Internet content for rank positioning. In general the more local the web page the fewer external links the content is likely to have. For every position lower on the search rank a user is 10 less likely to click through a link. Content is effectively buried when ranked off the first page of search results.

For example if user searches for the terms Italian food search engines return the set of all ranked content on the Internet of Italian Food . Recently search engines have attempted to improve search relevancy by geo locating users via IP address and narrowing a user s search by adding the user s location context to their searches and providing more geographically targeted search results. This change enables local content to better compete against Internet wide content. However users still have to guess the best search terms when attempting to find local data and the data is presented as a long list of disconnected items. Consequently there is always room for innovations and improvements.

Embodiments disclosed herein provide a new system method and computer program product for creating one or more self editing content streams based on geographic information web crawling and machine learning. The system can be automated or semi automated.

In some embodiments the system is configured to learn the local flavor of content and can deploy automated editors for each community serviced by the system. In some embodiments these automated editors can discover who publishes content locally what is locally interesting to the local audience and then generate on an ongoing basis streams of content based on the learned place interest. There is a large amount of local content hidden on the Internet and by mining this content and creating and automated editing facility end users can be presented with best local content available on the Internet for their area.

In some embodiments the system may comprise one or more server machines a geographic database and at least one non transitory computer readable medium storing instructions translatable by the one or more server machines to implement a method comprising particular steps performed at various stages.

At a first stage the method may comprise bootstrapping an initial set of terms for a particular place utilizing the geographic database. This bootstrapping process can be performed for every place in the geographic database. The geographic database may contain geographic information and spatial data. Local entity weighting data can be stored and associated with geo points line or polygon data types and may have an associated spatial reference system.

At a second stage the method may comprise building a local content corpus for the particular place utilizing the initial set of terms from the first stage. The local content corpus containing contents such as documents that are particularly relevant with respect to the particular place. At this stage a local content corpus also referred to as a local corpus may be built for every place geo space or geo point in the geographic database.

At a third stage the method may comprise populating an index with information from the local content corpus. The index contains relevancy of all the contents with respect to the place. The index can be used to retrieve content that is local and relevant to the particular place.

Documents that have been placed in a local corpus may not be ranked relative to the place or to each other. Instead they may be ranked in real time utilizing a weighting function. For example in response to a request about a place documents that have been placed in a local corpus for the place may be ranked based on local terms local entities in the documents. These local terms are deemed to be associated with that particular place relative to the entire body of text outside the place.

The request about the place may come from a browsing application or mobile app running on a client device connected to the one or more server machines. Software running on the one or more server machines may form a query to an indexing engine or search platform. In response to the query the system may dynamically rank the documents in the local content corpus with respect to search parameters in the query and relative to the place.

The system may perform on an ongoing basis targeted web crawling for additional content local to every place in the geographic database. Once content is acquired and indexed supervised content curating may be conducted. The system may be configured to collect categorization votes that selectively categorize indexed content based on target content categories. The categorization votes can be used to automatically classify new documents. An automated editing process may be configured to traverse a place hierarchy and to edit content pulled from the index to meet editing targets.

As discussed above using the IP geo locating methodology online local content can better compete against the entire body of content available on the Internet but users still have to guess the best search terms when attempting to find local data and the data is presented as a long list of disconnected items. Also due to the low resolution of IP geo locating current geographic search results tend to include only city level qualified content which makes neighborhood or address level search based on a user s current IP address impossible outside the realm of mobile devices.

Today to discover local information a search user continues to be confronted with guessing appropriate search terms for a given locality. This is a key usability problem. Users need to know an area before they can guess good search terms for that area. However users cannot get to know an area without knowing good terms. Guided content discovery can help users bridge this search term gap by using their geographical affiliation to deliver edited content about the area of interest which enables efficient local content discovery.

For the perspective of local content provider however this presents another problem. Search engine optimization SEO is the process of improving the visibility of a website or a web page in search engines via the natural or un paid organic or algorithmic search results. Savvy content providers and publishers alike often attempt to organize their content in a way that influences the ranking in search engine results. For example they may embed keywords and links in their content to drive up their content s relative ranking within search engine results. Competition for ranking has become highly specialized beyond the level of sophistication for most local content providers.

Recognizing the intrinsic need for local content embodiments disclosed herein provide a system for automated discovering curating and editing local content. The system can enable local content publishers to better reach local content consumers. Additionally local content can be provided in context with other local content to facilitate user information discovery.

In some embodiments the system can be organized into several stages of information acquisition and processing with each stage focusing on filtering or qualifying content based on geographic information. illustrates an example method implementing an embodiment of the system comprising first stage second stage and third stage . As will be described in further detail below method may comprise bootstrapping an initial set of terms for a place at first stage building a local content corpus for the place at second stage utilizing the initial set of terms for the place from first stage and populating an index at third stage with information from the documents in the local content corpus.

Within this disclosure a place can be any named area where a user has a primary affiliation. For example for cities a named area can be a neighborhood whereas for small towns a named area can be a town or municipality itself. In order classify content relative to place in some embodiments the system can be built to enable near constant time classification of content. As will be further described below this approach can be based on a local entity weighting approach for content classification.

The system allows self edited content to be created from general content templates based on web crawling and machine learning algorithms. These content templates are based on likely interest areas and can be customized by the end user. In this context self refers to the system. Editing is the process of reviewing and then condensing correcting or arranging written material images sound video or film with the objective of preparing it for final presentation. As an editor the system uses its understanding of the audience to determine the best content for publication. The system approximates simulates and automates the editing process by discovering who publishes content locally what is locally interesting to the local audience then generating on an ongoing basis streams of content based on the learned place interest.

The system also finds the relationships amongst data based on learning and or finding common patterns of information in the content. The relationships amongst data enable content tapestries to be created which in turn enables a user to see content in its local context.

In some embodiments the system may leverage enabling technologies. One example may be keyword search implementing a search algorithm. In computer science a search algorithm broadly speaking is an algorithm for finding an item with specified properties among a collection of items. Another example may be geotagging. Geotagging is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to various media such as photographs video websites SMS messages or RSS feeds described below and is a form of geospatial metadata. This data usually consist of latitude and longitude coordinates though they can also include altitude bearing distance accuracy data and place names. Geotagging is commonly used for photographs giving geotagged photographs. The amount of geotagged data is growing due to the adoption of personal mobile devices.

In some embodiments the system may leverage known standards including Internet publication standards which have emerged to enable easy interchange of content between parties. One example is RSS most commonly expanded as Really Simple Syndication which is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated works such as blog entries news headlines audio and video in a standardized format. An RSS document which can be called a feed web feed or channel includes full or summarized text plus metadata such as publishing dates and authorship. Web feeds benefit publishers by letting them syndicate content automatically. They benefit readers who want to subscribe to timely updates from favored websites or to aggregate feeds from many sites into one place. RSS feeds can be read using software called an RSS reader feed reader or aggregator which can be web based desktop based or mobile device based. A standardized XML file format allows the information to be published once and viewed by many different programs. The user subscribes to a feed by entering into the reader the feed s URI or by clicking a feed icon in a web browser that initiates the subscription process.

In some embodiments the system utilizes an indexing engine to build and index all the local content. Features of this indexing engine may include powerful full text search hit highlighting faceted search dynamic clustering database integration and rich document e.g. Word PDF etc. handling. Enabled by the indexing engine s distributed search and index replication functionality the system can be highly scalable and can support virtually unlimited content queries.

In one embodiment key word bootstrap may be configured to perform bootstrapping an initial set of terms for a place at first stage . Given any populated area there exists a set of well known geographic places. By using a geographic database also referred to herein as a geodatabase key word bootstrap can automatically create a set of keyword search terms.

A geodatabase is a database designed to store query and manipulate geographic information and spatial data of low dimensionality. Within a spatial database spatial data is treated as any other data type. Local entity weighting data can be stored and associated with geo point line or polygon data types and may have an associated spatial reference system. One primary advantage of spatial databases over file based data storage is that a geographic information system GIS can be built on the existing capabilities of relational database management systems RDBMS . This gives an otherwise standard database an ability to retrieve geospatial query terms and includes support for SQL and the ability to generate complex geospatial queries. Also a database s client server architecture supports multiple users simultaneously and lets them view edit and query the database without conflict.

A geodatabase record can use a geometry data type to represent the location of an object in the physical world and other standard database data types to store the object s associated attributes.

As an example geodatabase may contain state municipality macro area and neighborhood name data. Note however geography boundaries are not limited to any set of real state boundaries. Boundaries can include any affiliation that exists as a function of user location. These boundaries include school districts political municipal zoning etc. By leveraging these key word search terms based on key words based on boundaries and their name hierarchy and geo spatial queries based on boundary polygons an initial content data stream to be created for a given set of boundaries.

In one embodiment geodatabase may hold a set of all geo spatial polygons associated with places. This database also contains a place hierarchy. In one embodiment geographic places can be arranged in the place hierarchy where each level represents a geographic level. For example a U.S. address can be represented to reflect a geographic hierarchy for the purpose of efficient postal routing. More specifically suppose a U.S. address is as follows 

The address starts with the street which is the lowest level of a geographic hierarchy followed by the city then the state and then the country. Oriented in a parent to child order the address would read 

Local geographies decompose further into areas oriented around neighborhoods in most metropolitan areas. These local geographies are mainly a function of real estate boundaries and socio economic factors that partition populations within cities. As such this hierarchy encodes important social context that enable a reasonably targeted automated key word search to prime content acquisition. depicts local hierarchy and depicts an example of local hierarchy that captures a neighborhood located in Austin Tex.

This hierarchy further qualifies where Rosewood neighborhood resides by providing the macro area East Side as its parent. East Side refers to a section of Austin that is distinct from other sections of Austin.

In many cities this macro level decomposition reflects the compass directional North South East West etc. . However many cities may have districts that exist due to real estate development or area history.

The system can therefore be organized around places each representing a named area where a user has a primary affiliation. For cities this can be the neighborhood and for small towns this can be the town or municipality itself. Place affiliation can be a key to enabling effective content acquisition. When a user provides the system with their address the user is implicitly providing a rich context for the system to base automated content acquisition. In some embodiments these places groups can be defined by local boundaries below the city level. The system can be designed to operate best in the most specific local context.

Currently there is not a 100 reliable source for local boundaries i.e. boundaries below the city level . In order to drive content acquisition efficacy the system can be connected with local information sources to compile local boundary information for areas where the system is deployed.

In one embodiment by applying the following algorithm an initial set of bootstrap content can be generated. The content is referred to as bootstrap as it requires no a priori knowledge of an area other than local geographic hierarchy.

With this initial set of local search terms a set of keyword searches can be generated automatically for any place. These initial terms enable a bootstrap content stream to be created for any given place where the system is deployed.

Key word searches based on this algorithm enable an initial set of priming content or corpus to be created for the system e.g. at stage . This priming content establishes the initial body of content that the system will use to begin to baseline content relevancy. The system leverages Bayesian probability that local content for a place will have local entities with a higher relative probability.

To generate a local corpus the system first generates local content streams from each of the top level content data sources and aggregators using the bootstrap keyword search terms. Place based keyword search and geo spatial search based on local boundaries allow the system to build up for each place in the system a body of content relative to the place place corpus .

This place corpus provides the system with an importance of local terms local entities associated with a given place relative to the entire body outside a given local area. This importance can be determined using TFIDF term frequency inverse document frequency weighting. The TFIDF weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus and can be used in information retrieval and text mining. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. One example of TFIDF weighting algorithm is as follows 

In order to classify content relative to place the system enables near constant time O automated classification of content. This approach is based on a local entity weighting model approach for content classification. In system this is implemented in entity analyzer .

Document classification categorization is a general problem in information science. The task is to assign an electronic document to one or more categories based on its contents. Document classification tasks can be divided into two sorts supervised document classification where some external mechanism such as human feedback provides information on the correct classification for documents and unsupervised document classification where the classification must be done entirely without reference to external information. There is also a semi supervised document classification where parts of the documents are labeled by the external mechanism. In one embodiment the system is supervised and semi supervised where content is tagged by both internal content voting external input from users and existing reference tagged corpus for named entity recognition.

One example of a local entity weighting model may be a vector space model or term vector model which is an algebraic model for representing text documents and any objects in general as vectors of identifiers such as for example index terms. It is used in information filtering information retrieval indexing and relevancy rankings. In this case documents dj and queries q are represented as vectors with entity weights w1 . . . t .

Each vector corresponds to a separate term. If a term occurs in the document its value in the vector is non zero. The entity weights are established through TFIDF weighting. In one example the system defines local entities as people places and things found in local content using named entity recognition.

Vectorization can enable the system to highly compress and index the entire history of all content seen in or associated with a place by representing the history of content as a single large vector. This vector is updated as new content is discovered for or associated with a place and as product management selectively classifies sample documents by pre defined classification.

Each document that the system processes is mapped to a corresponding document vector by computing the CRC cyclical redundancy check one example of which is illustrated in .

As illustrated in the CRC computation resembles a polynomial long division operation in which the quotient is discarded and the remainder becomes the result with the important distinction that the polynomial coefficients are calculated according to the carry less arithmetic of a finite field. A CRC for a given string of characters has a high probability for being unique within a given sequence of bits. Using the CRC allows the system to create a hash that is unique for each term and map that hash into the term vector. The goal of using the hash is to insure that term vectors are both unique and highly orthogonal. An example vectorization algorithm is as follows 

These term vectors can then be plugged into a content history algorithm for a given document class to find the vector sum of all document vectors seen in that place 

To compute whether a document is similar to documents of a given class of documents within a place the system computes the cosine similarity between a document and that given class.

Those documents with higher cosine similarities computed against a place s term history are mathematically more relevant to that place than those documents with lower scores within document classes.

In addition to the vectorization approach described above other types of local entity weighting models may also be used.

Now that the system has local content corpora each representing a body of content that is local to a place the system uses an indexing engine to build and index all the local content. One example indexing engine is Elastic Search a distributed open source search server that supports the near real time search of Apache Lucene. Elastic Search can index data using JavaScript Object Notation JSON over HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP .

JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C family of languages including C C C Java JavaScript Perl Python and many others. Provide an index name a type and an identifier of a typed JSON document to Elastic Search and it will automatically perform indexing using a unique identifier at the type level and return the actual JSON document used to index the specific data. Each index in index database can have its own settings which can override the master settings. One index can be configured with a particular memory storage and have multiple 1 . . . n shards with 1 replica each and another index can have a file based storage with 1 shard and multiple replicas. All the index level settings can be controlled when creating an index using a JSON format.

Other suitable distributed search and index platforms may also be used for example Apache Solr which is an open source enterprise search platform from the Apache Lucene project. The system therefore can leverage features of Apache Lucene which include powerful full text search hit highlighting faceted search dynamic clustering database integration and rich document e.g. Word PDF handling. Both Elastic Search and Solr architectures enable wide scaling of the indexing system to support virtually unlimited content queries. As illustrated in system can deploy an instance of indexing engine that is shared across the entire system architecture.

These indexing engines enable the system to implement a customized neighborhood content ranking algorithm that determines the relevancy of documents contained in the index relative to a geo place.

To reflect use bias to most local content the system may implement a rank boosting algorithm based on content geotagging. Only a small percentage e.g. 5 of content found on the Internet is hard tagged with an originating location encoded as latitude and longitude using the standard geo microformats. Due to the low occurrence of hard geotagging local boosting is a function of both local relevancy score by document classification and geotag data when available. This allows content to be soft geotagged by using the local entity weighting classifier when no geotag is available for the content.

The boosting algorithm can be integrated into the indexing engine by implementing a custom ranking query one example of which is as follows 

The bigger SP is the more locally relevant the story is likely to be. The ranking function must work with hard geotagged data when soft geotagged data is not present. This gives the soft geotagged data equal footing with the hard geocoding which is useful since all pages will have soft geotagged data while only a small percent will have hard geotagged data.

If there is no hard geotagged data let L 0.25 arbitrary . Otherwise use previously calculated value of L 2 1 

The effect of applying this exponential boosting is creating shelves of very local data around places making content very near to the user boosted with higher relevancy and data from external neighborhoods to be driven down the rank effectively being excluded or filtered from the results. This allows strict partitioning of local data along the place hierarchy. A key aspect of geo places ranking is to rank content based on both Euclidian distance and whether the content is pinned inside a place boundary.

A namespace may be utilized to represent a place boundary. A namespace is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols i.e. names . Neighborhood names can have a crowded namespace due to their frequent re use from locality to locality. This neighborhood name collision when ranking content can be addressed by negating search results using a custom query capability configured for a suitable indexing engine of choice such as Elastic Search or Solr . Search results from the content index are negated when references to outside localities are encountered in the content.

As an example Hyde Park refers to a place in Chicago England and Austin Tex. The local content index allows search results to be filtered by applying Boolean negation to additional place references within the contents body. By combining geodatabase information and the content index searches can be easily pruned for less relevant content by applying stop words search filters implicitly for queries within a locality.

Output from the indexing engine in response to this sample search query is provided in Appendix A attached to this application.

With a content index in place and an initial base line of local entity weights by place the system can enable targeted web crawling for additional local content. This can be done at a stage that is separate or in conjunction with other stages also referred to as post indexing stages . As illustrated in a crawler e.g. content acquisition may be configured to continuously acquire content from Internet content sources at stage . The system may process the acquired content as described above and fine tune local content corpus . Index can be updated to include additional content with local relevancy with respect to local content corpus . As will be described further below the system may also conduct supervised and or semi supervised content curation for local content corpus at stage and self edit content in local content corpus at stage .

To enable the ongoing content polling at stage in one embodiment the system utilizes an open source crawler such as Nutch. depicts a diagrammatic representation of an example Nutch architecture. In one embodiment crawler can provide the underlying system platform with the following capabilities 

The crawler can enable the system to crawl links from local content and keyword search and score newly discovered content through local entity weighting and other customized criteria as links are crawled. This creates a targeted optimized web crawler for every place in the system. This web crawler uses a place s local taste encoded in the place s entity weights to find content that place would likely find interesting.

As discussed above the crawler can also monitor content sources on an ongoing basis to determine if there are any updates which enables large volumes of websites to be watched on a frequent basis. Once the system finds a good local source of content for a place that local source will be continuously monitored for updates and those updates are placed into the local content index e.g. index stored in the indexing engine. The crawler s continuous monitoring allows a set of frequently updated content streams to be created from a set of low frequency infrequently published sources.

As illustrated in once content is acquired and indexed product management or team of authorized users collectively curator can selectively categorize content based on target content categories utilizing voting application . These categorization votes category decisions can be stored in databases and factored in a post processing process not shown . Curator can vote on a current place s publication and the top of local content index for a given place.

As an example classifications may include neighborly content reflecting local flavor spam sports crime and other interest related categories. Curator can add and remove categories based on editorial judgment. These classifications can be arbitrary and can be combined with one another through logical composition.

Votes can associate entity weights with a particular classification and update existing entity weights that are used to automatically classify new documents.

Further category classification votes can be augmented based on user clicks to update the weights of each of the categories. For example and also referring to if a user clicks through a categorized content item via any one of categorized document streams based on category and does not page bounce from that item this viewing content voting can ascribe a weighted acceptance of a content s categorization. This value content classification data is weighted due to the uncertainty in the information the viewing ascribes. Votes views and likes may be stored in database accessible by the indexing engine described above.

Over time as the system runs and more clicks and more votes are collected the categories and entity weight histories capture the place relative categorization. These categories are place relative due to the fact the entity weights vary from place to place and reflect a place s tendency to contain local entities. With these entity weights in place any content can be scored for place affinity for any place in the system.

Using with the local content index and automated content categorization based on local entity weighting an automated editing process can be created. depicts a diagrammatic representation of an example of a supervised learning process which draws from content in the index based on editing targets and optimizing based on best available content and content mixes. As an example and also referring to automated editing function or editor may operate to review a curated piece of content step perhaps with place ranking data and determine whether that content is local to a certain place step . If so the system may add to the local weight of entities in the curated content step . If not the system may subtract from the weights of entities found in the curated document step . Database is then updated to reflect any adjustment made to the local weighted entities step .

Content mixes can enable editing targets to reflect available content. This can be useful with respect to density in various places. For example urban centers often have a high amount of social content like Twitter and there are large numbers of places of interest which anchor content streams. By contrast suburban communities have sparser content streams driven by occasional posts from fixed content sources. An optimization goal for the automated editor is to drive regular updates to each content stream as available content allows.

In one embodiment an automated editing process pulls from the content index and applies a customized collection algorithm based on content mix type. The collection algorithm pulls from the index creating a rotation of content based on geographic and content categories. An example editing algorithm is provided below 

The editing algorithm climbs the place hierarchy to meet content targets. This allows the system to optimize for the most local relevant content available by each of the content categories. Other suitable editing algorithms may also be implemented.

The system s knowledge increases with each pass of process strengthening the system s ability to dynamically rank local content that is highly relevant to a particular place and or local favor. Each place added in the geodatabase may also increase the system s ability to further distinguish local entities.

As a specific example in causing request to be sent user may not need to proactively do anything other than opening an application. If user is using a mobile device this may be as simple as opening a mobile app. The mobile app knows the location through internal GPS and time. The mobile app may comprise client software of system the client software capable of forming a query to search index that essentially asks What is the most local place to eat or piece of news content at this time and place. An example input in JSON to the search index is as follows 

In response system returns at least one stream of most relevant news articles and places to go at that time. Stream may be presented to the user in various ways. As a specific example suppose the user is in the Bay Area opening an app implementing an embodiment disclosed herein may cause a client device running the app to display stream as a thermal image or media showing the most relevant white hot news articles and places to go in the Bay Area as illustrated in . Local content relevant to the Bay Area may also be presented using a pinned map with each pin representing a geographic feature which can be either a point on the map a street corner between Bay Street and Columbus Avenue in San Francisco Calif. or a polygon San Jose Calif. . Other ways to present local content relevant to a place may also be possible.
