It is not intended that the invention be summarized here in its entirety. Rather further features aspects and advantages of the invention are set forth in or are apparent from the following description and drawings.

In a set up phase of a website a human editor creates enhanced book memos see step and associates the enhanced book memos with text or objects such as photos or graphics or video on a website see step . An enhanced book memo comprises structured data and optional data as discussed below. A book memo differs from a bookmark i the same book memo may be available at multiple web sites whereas a bookmark is unique to a website and ii the book memo does not necessarily indicate the web site at which it was found whereas a bookmark indicates the web site at which it was found. A book memo is similar to a bookmark in that both relate to webpages and both are saved to special data stores associated with a user.

In a set up of a user account registered at the website a user may optionally configure their memobook see step that is their book of book memos with one or more lists.

In operation a website displays text or objects associated with enhanced book memos in a specific manner such as a different color or background or frame or with a special icon superimposed thereon. A user hovers his or her cursor over an enhanced book memo to cause a window to pop up enabling saving of the enhanced book memo to the user s memobook possibly with annotations by the user.

During operation a user can view their memobook showing the contents of each enhanced book memo as created by the editor.

Accordingly a user can quickly save meaningful information for things found on the Internet. The providers of information have the opportunity to give descriptive and operational information to users beyond the information presented on a web page. The enhanced book memos can be shared from one user to another in various ways. Enhanced book memos improve the ease of saving information the ease of acting on information and the ease of purchasing products.

An embodiment of the present invention will now be discussed. The user s file or book of enhanced book memos is referred to as a memobook . An enhanced book memo is also referred to as an entry or clipping in the memobook.

For instance for a small display size a webpage is configured in a one column format whereas for a large display size a webpage may be configured in a four column format.

Partnersite is a website that is operated by a third party. During creation of webpages for partnersite an editor and or developer adds special icons or signifiers for enhanced book memos to the webpages stored in data storage see step . In this embodiment the enhanced book memos for partnersite are stored in data storage . When a user registered at mainsite receives a webpage from partnersite the user can add an enhanced book memo from partnersite to his or her memobook maintained at mainsite .

Generally mainsite provides an application programming interface API for use by a developer at partnersite explaining how to create an enhanced book memo and embed it on the web site of partnersite . In some cases the user must go to mainsite to access their memobook. In other cases the developer at partnersite uses the API to make the user s memobook accessible to the user at the web site of partnersite .

In other embodiments discussed below the enhanced book memos are maintained at mainsite see step and can be updated by the creator owner of the enhanced book memo see step .

The third row is provided by a webpage from mainsite and includes a horizontal navigation bar with links to MyAccount Memobook and Help . Clicking on or otherwise suitably indicating the Memobook link enables the user to view their memobook as discussed below. The Memobook link is an actuatable indication of a database program.

The body of the webpage has four multi media areas Picture Picture Picture and Picture which represent multi media files such as a graphic image photograph audio video file or audio file. Proximate to each of the multi media areas is a logically associated text area Text Text Text and Text.

The webpage in has five indicators for enhanced book memos. An icon shown as MB in a multi pointed oval appears as an overlay on each of Picture Picture and Picture. Specially highlighted text in each of Text and Text indicates that the text is associated with an enhanced book memo. The highlighting may include one or more of a different color than the main text a different font type or font size or font emphasis bold underline italic a different background color or a special effect such as blinking text. Each icon and specially highlighted text is an actuatable indication of a saveable file the enhanced book memo.

The enhanced book memo indicated by the icon overlaid on Picture is the same as the enhanced book memo indicated by the specially highlighted text in Text . That is there can be multiple ways to indicate the same enhanced book memo.

At the bottom of the webpage shown in there is provided an area labelled FOR YOUR MEMOBOOK that indicates the four enhanced book memos on the webpage. Each of the enhanced book memos is represented as its thumbnail image.
