Other needle systems are contemplated including one or more microneedles. In one embodiment the injector is needleless non limiting examples of which include jet injectors electroporation iontophoresis ultrasound micro shock wave powder injection and tape stripping see e.g. Jagadeesh et al. . 2011 18 539 545 which is incorporated herein by reference . In one embodiment the at least one type of injector is a syringe with a standard length injection needle. For example standard injection needles range in length from 3 16 inches 5 mm to 1 inches 38 mm from the tip of the needle bevel to the needle hub. The choice of injection needle will also be dependent upon how deep the injection is intended to go. For example needles ranging in length from inch to inch can be used for subcutaneous injections while needles ranging in length from 1 inch to 1 inch can be used for intramuscular injections. Injection needles are further defined by the outer diameter i.e. gauge of the needle shaft. The gauge of an injection needle is inversely proportional to its outer diameter. Injections needle range in gauge from 7 gauge outer diameter approximately 4.6 mm to 34 gauge outer diameter approximately 0.19 mm . Injection needles commonly used for injecting agents into mammalian tissue range in size from 21 to 32 gauge.

In one embodiment the one or more of a letter number shape symbol color or combination thereof are representative of at least one depth of injection at the one or more illuminated injection sites. The depth to which a needle for example is inserted at any given illuminated injection site and into the underlying tissue of the body region is dependent upon both the specific features of the body region and on the injectable agent being injected at said illuminated injection site. For example specific features of an individual s face could dictate injection depth including the severity of lines or wrinkles and or the thickness of the tissue layers at any given injection site. For example the thickness of the epidermis top layer of skin is about 0.05 mm near the eye lids while the epidermis on the rest of the face is on average of about 0.1 to 0.3 mm. In addition the injection depth may be dependent upon the age of the individual as the tissue layers thin with increasing age. Furthermore the depth may be dependent upon the injectable agent being injected and the type of tissue into which said injectable agent is injected. For example the dermal filler hyaluronic acid can be injected into the superficial papillary dermis for treating fine wrinkles and scars but is injected deeper into the reticular dermis for deeper lines. Similarly collagen filler can be injected into the papillary and middle dermis to treat fine lines and wrinkles in the upper lip the periorbital area and glabella of the face. Polymethylmethacrylate microspheres filler can be injected subdermally e.g. into the border of the dermis and subcutaneous fat to treat rhytids and scars. toxin can be injected to about 2 to 3 mm below the surface of the skin.

In one embodiment the one or more of a letter number shape symbol color or combination thereof are representative of at least one angle of injection at the one or more illuminated injection sites. The angle at which a needle of an injector is inserted into the underlying tissue of the body region is dependent upon the nature of the injectable agent and the depth to which the injectable agent is being injected. In one embodiment the at least one injectable agent is injected with an injector at the one or more illuminated injection sites at a 90 degree angle relative to the surface of the body region. In one embodiment the at least one injectable agent is injected with an injector at the one or more illuminated injection sites at less than a 90 degree angle relative to the surface of the body region. For example injections into the muscle with e.g. penicillin may be done with an injector at a 90 degree angle injections into the subcutaneous tissue with e.g. morphine may be done with an injector at a 45 degree angle and injections into the epidermis or dermis with e.g. a vaccine may be done with an injector at a 10 to 15 degree angle.

The state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware software and or firmware implementations of aspects of systems the use of hardware software and or firmware is generally but not always in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs.

For example if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and or firmware vehicle alternatively if flexibility is paramount the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation or yet again alternatively the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware software and or firmware. Hence there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and or devices and or other technologies described herein can be effected none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns e.g. speed flexibility or predictability of the implementer any of which may vary.

A system and method are described for generating an illuminated injection guide for cosmetic treatment of a facial region e.g. forehead of an individual with an injectable agent e.g. toxin. The system includes a computing device including a processor e.g. a desktop computer and a non transitory signal bearing medium bearing one or more instructions implemented on the desktop computer. The system can optionally include one or more image capture devices for capturing digital images of the facial region of the individual.

A digital representation of the face of an individual is generated from one or more digital images of the individual s face including at least a portion of the individual s forehead. The one or more digital images are received by the desktop computer either from a second computing device via wired or wireless transmission or from the one or more image capture devices. For the latter two charge coupled device cameras and a projector connected to the desktop computer are used to scan the body region of the individual s face as described in Feng et al. . 2010 48 105 109 which is incorporated herein by reference. The individual s face is exposed to structured light which the cameras collects upon reflection to obtain an optical representation of the body region by a point cloud of up to 300 000 points in three dimensional coordinates. The three dimensional coordinates are acquired by the computer and used to construct a digital representation of the face using a CAD CAM software package e.g. Geomagic Studio Morrisville N.C. . One or more physical registration landmarks e.g. anatomical features of the face are incorporated into the digital representation of the face as digital registration landmarks.

Digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation of the individual s face. The digitally registered injection sites can be added automatically by the computing device based on a preprogrammed injection treatment plan. Alternatively the digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation of the individual s face by a physician or other practitioner using a user input device e.g. a keyboard or touchpad associated with the desktop computer. The physician or other practitioner may work directly with the individual to position the digitally registered injection sites so as to attain a desired outcome e.g. reducing wrinkles without excessively immobilizing facial muscles.

The digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation in an injection treatment pattern. The injection treatment pattern includes a triangular pattern of 9 to 13 digitally registered injection sites which are added to the region of the digital representation corresponding to the individual s forehead. The 9 to 13 digitally registered injection sites correspond to intended injections sites for toxin on the individual s forehead. The digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation relative to physical registration landmarks represented by digital registration landmarks. In this example the physical landmarks include the eye brows frontal scalp line and midline of the forehead. The digitally registered injection sites are registered 0.5 centimeters below the lateral brow in the midpupillary line halfway between the eyebrow and the frontal scalp on each side of the model at the vertex of the forehead at the midline just below the meeting of the eyebrows at the midline of the forehead halfway between the nasal radix and the vertex of the scalp and over the corrugators approximately 1 centimeter above the medial portion of the each eyebrow see e.g. Bain et al. . 2006 26 617 619 which is incorporated herein by reference .

The digitally registered injection sites further include information regarding treatment parameters in the form of letters number and or colors. The digitally registered injection site are represented by B3 to represent 3 Units of toxin to be injected at said site. Typical dosages of toxin per injection site range from 1 to 6 Units. The placement of injection sites as well as the treatment patterns can be either automatically added to the digital representation or added by a physician or other practitioner using a user input device. The physician or other practitioner can also decide how many units should be injected per injection site based on the depth and or intensity of the wrinkles on the individual s forehead and add that information to the digital representation.

The digital representation including the digitally registered injection sites corresponding to one or more illuminated injection sites and one or more digital registration landmarks corresponding to one or more physical registration landmarks is directly by the computing device on which it was generated to proceed with guided injection using illuminated injection sites or can be sent via a wireless transmission to another computing device for actual injection treatment.

A system and method of guiding injection in an individual is described. The system consists of controllable light emitting elements e.g. laser diodes wired to a computing device including a processor e.g. a laptop computer and an image capture device e.g. a digital camera. A digital representation of the facial region of an individual in need of treatment is received by the computing device via the internet from a referring physician. The digital representation includes digital registration landmarks corresponding to physical registration landmarks on the face of the individual. The physical registration landmarks include anatomical features e.g. nose eyes cheeks wrinkles and the like as well as pigmented areas e.g. freckles associated with the facial region of the individual. The digital representation also includes digitally registered injection sites that have been registered relative to the digital registration landmarks. In this example the digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation of the facial region in accordance with an injection treatment plan by the referring physician using one or more of the methods described herein prior to transmission of the digital representation to the laptop computer.

The laptop computer is operable to control the controllable laser diodes to emit light onto the surface of the facial region of the individual in accordance with the injection treatment plan. A first set of laser diodes emits red light a second set of laser diodes emits green light and a third set of laser diodes emits blue light. The color of light emitted depends upon the dose of toxin required at a given illuminated injection site. The illuminated injection sites corresponding to the digitally registered injection sites are arranged in an injection treatment pattern. In this example the injection treatment pattern of illuminated injection sites is arranged for treatment of the glabella region i.e. the space between the eyebrows. In this instance the glabella region can be divided into the superior lateral region and the central and inferomedial regions. Injection sites are illuminated on the superior lateral region over the medial portion of the corrugators muscle near its origin. Additional injection sites are illuminated over the mid portion of the muscle belly. Each of these sites is illuminated with red light indicating treatment with 5 units of toxin. In addition injection sites are illuminated over the middle of the procerus muscle belly which is slightly off midline at the level of the superior orbital rims. This pattern is repeated on the other side. Each of these sites is illuminated with green light indicating treatment with 6 units of toxin. Injection sites are illuminated over the depressor supercilli muscle which is approximately 1 centimeter above the medial canthal tendon on both sides. Each of these sites is illuminated with blue light indicating treatment with 3 units of toxin.

A physician or other practitioner prepares the toxin e.g. toxin A sold under the trademark BOTOX for injection. A 100 Unit vial of BOTOX which has been stored frozen is thawed and mixed with 2.5 4.0 milliliters ml of 0.9 non preserved sterile saline solution to create a final concentration of 40 25 Units ml. Saline including a preservative or water for injection WFI can also be used for this purpose.

In some instances depending on the sensitivity pain threshold of the individual the surface of body region is coated with a layer of anesthetic cream e.g. a eutectic mix of the local anesthetics lidocaine 2.5 and prilocaine 2.5 prior to injection. Alternatively or in addition the surface of the body region is cooled with application of an ice pack for 10 15 minutes as a means of reducing the pain of injection and or post injection swelling. A 1 or 3 ml syringe with a 30 gauge needle is used for injection although needles ranging in gauge from 27 to 32 can be used for this purpose. Appropriate length needles for this purpose include inch 12.7 mm 5 16 inch 8 mm and 3 16 inch 5 mm lengths. A syringe including a 30 gauge needle is filled with the appropriately prepared toxin and the needle is inserted into the underlying tissue of the body region at an illuminated injection site and the appropriate amount of toxin is injected based on the color of the illuminated injection site. Similar steps are repeated for additional injections until all the illuminated injection sites of the treatment pattern have been injected. In some treatments a single syringe may be filled with enough toxin for the entire treatment pattern and the needle is changed between injections or the same needle is used for all injections.

The image capture device e.g. digital camera of the system provides feedback as to where the illuminated injection sites are relative to the physical registration landmarks. For example the digital camera captures images of the illuminated injection sites on the surface of the facial region and including the physical registration landmarks. This information is processed by tracking software in the laptop computer and signals are sent to the controllable laser diodes to adjust the positioning of where they are illuminating the surface of the body region in order to keep the illuminated injection sites appropriately registered.

The individual may return from 30 to 120 days later for a repeat course of injections depending upon the sustainability of the treatment. In repeat visits the same injection treatment pattern of illuminated injection sites may be used if appropriate. Alternatively the physician or other practitioner may alter the illuminated injection sites and or the associated treatment parameters.

Generation and use of one or more illuminated injection sites in an injection treatment pattern is described. The injection treatment pattern is part of an injection treatment plan designed to treat the skin folds associated with the nasolabial folds i.e. laugh lines of an individual s face with injected hyaluronic acid filler.

A digital representation is generated from one or more digital images of at least a portion of an individual s face with particular emphasis on the nasolabial folds. The digital representation is generated using the image capture methods described in Example 1. Alternatively the digital representation of the individual s face is generated using a PRIMOS optical three dimensional in vivo skin measurement device GFMesstechnik Teltow Germany . This system projects structured light e.g. a parallel stripe pattern onto the face of the individual the reflection of which is captured on a charge coupled device chip of a shooting camera through a shooting optic. The measurement system consists of a freely movable optical measurement head with an integrated micro mirror projector a projection optic a shooting optic and a charge coupled device recording camera together with a computer system. A three dimensional effect is achieved by deflection of the parallel projection stripes by the topography the individual s face. The deflections are digitalized and quantitatively evaluated using software. Mathematical algorithms are used to generate a three dimensional image of the individual s face which becomes the basis for the digital representation see e.g. Levenberg . 2010 20 615 619 which is incorporated herein by reference .

A pattern of one to ten digitally registered injection sites is added to the digital representation of the individual s face each injection site represented by a circle. Injection of hyaluronic acid into the nasolabial folds can be done at a single injection site by the process of threading or at multiple injection sites along the fold. Threading involves injecting the needle under the skin all the way to a distant point and then slowly removing the needle while releasing the injectable agent. To accommodate threading in which the injection needle is injected at an angle of about 10 to 30 degrees relative to plane of the skin surface annotations are added to the digital representation and are projected onto the individual s face. For example an annotation indicating an angle of injection e.g. 25 degrees at the illuminated injection sites is added to the digital representation. For multiple injection sites multiple digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation relative to a linear path along the nasolabial fold.

Annotations are added to the digital representation to indicate the dosage of hyaluronic acid filler to be used at each injection site. For injection into the nasolabial folds the injection volume can be as high as 6 ml per fold although the preferable volume is 1 3 ml per fold and depends upon the depth of the fold and how much correction is desired by the individual see e.g. Prager Steinkraus . 2010 20 748 752 which is incorporated herein by reference . The physician or other practitioner can determine the appropriate dosage of the hyaluronic filler by assessing the depth of the nasolabial fold from either viewing the individual s face directly or viewing the captured and processed three dimensional image of the individual s face on a computer monitor. Alternatively the computing device used to generate the digital representation can include one or more algorithms to determine the appropriate dosage based on the captured image information.

The surface of the individual s face is wiped with a disinfectant e.g. rubbing alcohol and the injection sites are illuminated using a mini projector e.g. a 3M Mobile Projector MP220 from 3M St. Paul Minn. . The illuminated injection sites correspond to the digitally registered injection sites. The projector also projects the annotations onto the surface of the body region.

The hyaluronic acid filler for injection is preferably one of the agents approved by the United States Food Drug Administration FDA e.g. Restylane from Medicis Aesthetics Inc. Scottsdale Ariz. . Restylane is provided by the manufacturer in a disposable glass syringe. Needles inch in length and either 29 or 30 gauge are recommended for use with this product. The hyaluronic acid filler is injected at the illuminated injection sites with instructions from the annotations the annotations including treatment parameters and or other instructions pertinent to the injection treatment plan.

An embodiment of a system and method are described for guiding neurotoxin injection in an individual for treatment of blepharospasm eye lid spasm . The system includes controllable light emitting elements configured to emit non destructive light a computing device including a processor and an injector tracking device. The system can also optionally include an image capture device.

A digital representation of the facial region of an individual with blepharospasm is received by the computing device of the system the digital representation including digital registration landmarks corresponding to physical registration landmarks. The physical registration landmarks include the inner and outer canthi of both eyes the pre tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid the lateral pre tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid the levator palpebrae superioris the medial lower lid the center of the upper lip the outer corners of the mouth the intersection of the frontal bone and two nasal bones of the skull nasion the tip of the nose pronasale a subnasal point and a chin point.

The digital representation of the individual s face further includes digitally registered injection sites added to the digital representation of the eye lid area of the individual. The digitally registered injection sites are represented by crosshairs to indicate injection sites. The crosshairs vary in color to indicate specific treatment parameters e.g. the dose of toxin used at each injection site. For the treatment of blepharospasm with a toxin e.g. BOTOX from Allergan Inc. Irvine Calif. the digitally registered injection sites are registered relative to the eye lid region corresponding to regions either proximal to or over the medial and lateral pre tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid and into the lateral pre tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid. Care is taken to avoid registering injection sites near the levator palpebrae superioris and the medial lower lid to avoid complications of ptosis and diplopia respectively. A series of digitally registered injection sites represented by crosshairs and corresponding to 5 to 10 individual injection sites per eye are added to the digital representation. In addition annotation is added to the digital representation indicating the number units of toxin to be injected e.g. 1.25 to 3.0 units per injection for a total of 30 units per eye. The digitally registered injection sites are also registered so as to avoid injection into an underlying blood vessel. The location of underlying blood vessels are imaged using a light emitting diode illumination system such as that described in U.S. Patent Application 2008 0306392 which is incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding blood vessel location is added to the digital representation of the individual s face and avoided when placing the digitally registered injection sites.

The injection sites are illuminated onto the surface of the individual s face with laser diodes the illuminated injection sites corresponding to the digitally registered injection sites. Each injection site on the surface of the individual s face is sequentially illuminated with a crosshair approximately 9 millimeters in length. The crosshair is generated using a crosshair diffractive diffuser DE R 201 Cross 5 from Frankfurt Laser Co. Germany and a red 633 nm laser diode.

BOTOX is prepared for injection per the manufacturer s instructions. A 30 gauge needle with a length of 4 mm is used for injecting 1.5 units of BOTOX per injection site at the illuminated injection sites. A syringe including the 30 gauge needle includes a removable injector tracking device for tracking movement of the syringe relative to the illuminated injection sites. The injector tracking device includes a photo sensor that is a photo diode with high performance in ambient light e.g. the dimmed background light in a treatment room as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 891 570 which is incorporated herein by reference. The injector tracking device includes a processor capable of subtracting out signals due to the ambient light relative to the bright red illuminated injection site. The injector tracking device further includes a miniature audio chip operably connected to the photo sensor and configured to emit a peeping sound when the photo sensor is activated by proximity of the syringe to the illuminated injection site. BOTOX is injected into the underlying eyelid area to a depth of 2 mm. Each treatment lasts approximately three months following which the procedure may be repeated. At that time the injection treatment pattern and or the treatment parameters may be modified.

Systems and methods are described for illuminating a pattern of injection sites onto the upper thigh of an individual as part of an injection treatment plan for self injecting hormones to induce ovulation for use in in vitro fertilization.

A digital image of the upper thigh of an individual is acquired using one of the methods previously described herein. Alternatively digital images of the upper thigh of the individual are acquired with a standard digital camera and combined with images of blood vessels at or near the surface of the skin. An example of an apparatus for imaging blood vessels is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 522 911 which is incorporated herein by reference. The digital images further ideally include one or more physical registration landmarks e.g. freckles moles tattoos etc. for registering digitally registered injection sites. If no visible landmarks are present on the surface of the body region the physician or other practitioner can add markings e.g. ink or adhesive pieces to the upper thigh for use as physical registration landmarks. The digital images are used by a computing device to generate a digital representation of the upper thigh including digital registration landmarks corresponding to the physical registration landmarks.

A series of digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation of the body region. The number of digitally registered injection sites is dependent upon the number of planned injections during the ovulation cycle. The number of planned injections is further dependent upon the types of injectable hormones used and the menstrual cycle of the individual. Eggs are matured in vivo prior to harvesting for in vitro fertilization using some combination of gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH antagonists follicle stimulating hormone FSH and human chorionic gonadotropin hCG . In this example the injection treatment plan is individualized to the individual s menstrual cycle and includes multiple injections of the GnRH antagonist leuprolide acetate e.g. Lupron and FSH over the course of 14 to 21 days and a final injection with hCG two days prior to harvesting eggs. Digitally registered injection sites are added to the digital representation of the upper thigh the digitally registered injection sites represented by letters numbers and shapes. The letter number and shapes further indicate treatment parameters e.g. the type of drug to be injected the dose of drug to be injected and or the day in the treatment cycle. Alternatively or in addition treatment parameters are included as annotations that are projected at or near illuminated injection sites.

The digital representation of the upper thigh including the digitally registered injection sites the digital registration landmarks any annotations and instructions for projecting the injection guide are received by a computing device incorporated in a head mounted system. The head mounted system includes the computing device controllable light emitting elements and an image capture device. An illustrative example of a head mounted system and an annotated injection treatment pattern are provided in . shows head mounted system worn on head region of an individual. In this example head mounted system is attached to a strap encircling head region but the system could be incorporated into a hat or other head covering. Head mounted system emits light beam onto the surface of the upper thigh . Light beam illuminates injection site .
