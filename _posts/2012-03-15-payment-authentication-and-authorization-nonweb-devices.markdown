The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Appl. Ser. No. 61 453 843 filed Mar. 17 2011 and titled PAYMENT AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION NON WEB DEVICES which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The present application is also related to concurrently filed U.S. Applications entitled CONDUCTING SECURE TRANSACTIONS OVER A MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE bearing U.S. Pat. No. 13 420 654 and SINGLE DIGITAL WALLET ACROSS MULTIPLE PAYMENT PLATFORMS bearing U.S. Pat. No. 13 420 663 both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to conducting electronic transactions and more particularly to conducting transactions using a media display device such as a television set.

Before the rise of electronic media consumers usually go to physical brick and mortar stores to conduct their purchases. As electronic commerce became increasingly popular in recent years consumers have been given more options to complete their shopping without leaving their homes. For example the consumer may see a product advertised during a TV infomercial. If the consumer wishes to purchase the product he may then call the merchant selling the product or go to the merchant s website to complete the purchase. However transactions like the one described above may be cumbersome for example they require the consumer to leave the TV may not be interactive enough and may also lack sufficient security.

Therefore while existing electronic commerce transactions involving TVs have been generally adequate for their intended purposes they have not been entirely satisfactory in every aspect. It would be advantageous to make it easier for prospective consumers to conduct secure transactions through a TV.

The present disclosure involves a method of conducting a transaction comprising indicating while a media program is being displayed on a media display device an item associated with the media program is available for purchase receiving authentication information of a prospective purchaser of the item and completing a purchase of the item in response to the authentication information.

The present disclosure involves an apparatus comprising a non transitory tangible machine readable storage medium storing a computer program wherein the computer program contains machine readable instructions that when executed electronically by processors perform indicating while a media program is being displayed on a media display device an item associated with the media program is available for purchase receiving authentication information of a prospective purchaser of the item and completing a purchase of the item in response to the authentication information.

The present disclosure involves an apparatus comprising a media display device operable to display a media program and indicate while the media program is being displayed an item associated with the media program is available for purchase and a set top box coupled to the media display device wherein the set top box is operable to receive authentication information of a prospective purchaser of the item and complete a purchase of the item in response to the authentication information.

It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of the present disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are of course merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. Various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for simplicity and clarity.

Before the rise of electronic media consumers usually had to conduct their shopping outside their homes. A prospective consumer would have to go visit one or more physical brick and mortar stores to survey the merchandise available at each store. If the consumer is interested in a piece of merchandise he then buys and pays for the merchandise at the store that offers it for sale.

As electronic commerce became more popular in recent years consumers have been given more flexibility regarding being able to do shopping without having to leave their homes. For example a consumer may see a product being advertised while watching an infomercial on television TV . The infomercial may display the merchant s phone number and or website address. If the consumer is interested in purchasing the product he may call the merchant or log on to the merchant s website to complete the purchase. However these types of transactions may be inconvenient to the consumer as the consumer may not be able to instantly buy the product but may be forced to leave the TV. In addition these transactions may not be secure enough.

According to the various aspects of the present disclosure an improved method of conducting a transaction through a TV is disclosed as discussed in more detail below.

The method continues with a step in which a consumer is prompted to enter his account verification information associated with the third party payment provider. In some embodiments the consumer may be prompted to enter his mobile telephone number or another suitable personal identification number PIN linked to his account with the third party payment provider. In other embodiments the consumer may be prompted to enter a username and a password that are associated with his account with the third party payment provider. In certain embodiments the consumer may be allowed to choose to enter either the mobile telephone number or the username and password or another suitable identifier associated with his account.

The method continues with a decision step to determine if the account information has been verified. In embodiments where the consumer chooses to enter a mobile telephone number or another suitable PIN the decision step checks to see if the entered mobile telephone number or PIN matches any existing numbers associated with the third party payment provider. If the answer is no then the method may proceed to a step in which the consumer is prompted to register for an account with the third party payment provider. In some embodiments if the consumer wishes not to register for an account a guest PIN may be sent to the consumer e.g. as a text message to the consumer s mobile telephone or as an email to the consumer s email address upon the consumer s request. The guest PIN provides a temporary login for the consumer to complete the transaction.

In a similar manner in embodiments where the consumer chooses to enter a username and a password the decision step checks to see if the combination of entered username and password matches an existing account with the third party payment provider. If the answer is no then the method proceeds to the step in which the consumer is prompted to register for an account with the third party payment provider. Once again if the consumer chooses not to register for an account at this time a temporary guest login may be sent to the consumer to complete the transaction.

If the answer from the decision step is yes whether as a result of a matched mobile phone number or a correct combination of username and password being entered the method continues with a step in which the purchase is confirmed with the consumer. In various embodiments the purchase confirmation may display to the consumer information such as the consumer s name and address as well as the product s name quantity and price. In some embodiments as a part of the execution of the step the consumer may be given an option to change one or more aspects of the purchase including but not limited to the quantity or the consumer s shipping address.

The method continues with a step in which it is determined whether automatic login should be used for subsequent purchases. In some embodiments the consumer may be specifically prompted as to whether he would prefer to have the login information remembered for his subsequent purchases. Having the login information remembered is convenient when the consumer lives alone and or is using his own TV at home. On the other hand if the consumer is traveling e.g. watching a TV program at a hotel at which he is staying or has to share the TV with other roommates then the consumer may choose not to have his login information remembered for security purposes. Based on the answer received form the consumer the method may either remember or discard the login information.

It is understood that the method discussed above merely illustrates an example process flow and is not intended to be limiting and that additional steps may be performed before during or after the steps of the method . To facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the method are provided to graphically illustrate some embodiments of the method .

Referring to an example user interface A is displayed. According to the various aspects of the present disclosure the user interface A is a screenshot of a TV program that the consumer is watching. In some embodiments the TV program may be a movie a TV show a music video a commercial a documentary an educational program a sporting event a video game or another suitable media program displayed on the consumer s TV set. According to certain aspects of the present disclosure the TV program is being displayed to the TV set through a video stream or data stream . At various points of the video stream there are embedded trigger points in the video stream to notify the consumer that an offer for a merchandise is available.

In some embodiments the offer may be displayed as a text box or a dialog box A which contains a brief description of the product being offered. As discussed above with reference to the product being offered may be a tangible piece of merchandise or a digital item. As an example the product being offered in is the musical soundtrack from the TV program which is a movie. As other non limiting examples the product being offered may be a piece of clothing e.g. for a specific brand name that the actor actress is wearing a coupon for a restaurant or store shown in the background or a deal to buy an item appearing in the scene of the TV program e.g. a 20 off offer to buy a motorcycle that is shown in the scene . In other words the product being offered is integrated into or embedded within the TV program. At predetermined times while the TV is program is being shown to the consumer the right offers will be triggered and be displayed to the consumer.

In some embodiments the availability of the offer will initially be displayed as a small icon not illustrated herein which may be shown unobtrusively near a corner of the screen so as to not disrupt the consumer s viewing of the TV program. The icon may or may not indicate what the product being offered will be. If the consumer is interested in finding out more about the offer he can click on the icon which may then expand into the text box A shown in . In certain embodiments the consumer may be given a choice with respect to how he wishes to be notified of the offer he may elect not to be notified of any offers at all or he may elect to be first notified of an availability of an offer with the small unobtrusive icon or he may elect to be notified of the offer with a text box such as the text box A of . The consumer may set these preferences before or during the TV program is being played.

In addition to displaying the description of the product being offered the text box A may also display the price and or quantity of the product as well as one or more payment options. For example a logo of the third party payment provider e.g. PAYPAL may be displayed as one of the payment options.

Referring now to once the consumer chooses to pay with the third party payment provider an example user interface B is displayed to the consumer in which the consumer is prompted to enter suitable identification information associated with his account with the third party payment provider. In the embodiment illustrated in the user interface B contains a text box B that prompts the consumer to enter a mobile telephone number that is linked to his third party payment provider account. In some embodiments the consumer may enter the mobile telephone number through a suitable mechanism such as a TV remote.

Referring now to after the consumer inputs his mobile telephone number an example user interface C is displayed to the consumer. In this case it has been verified that the mobile telephone number that the consumer has entered does match a telephone number for an existing user in the third party payment provider s system. Consequently the user interface C displays a text box C that prompts the consumer to enter a secret code or a PIN associated with the correct user. For example the secret code or PIN may be a multi digit number.

Referring now to the consumer has entered the correct secret code or PIN and has been successfully verified and he is now considered logged in to the system. It is understood that in some embodiments the consumer may also log in to the system using an email address and a password rather than the mobile phone number and a PIN. The consumer may be given the option to choose a preferred login method. For reasons of simplicity the user interfaces pertaining to the email password login method is not illustrated herein. Regardless of which method the consumer chooses to log in to the system once he has been correctly verified an example user interface D then displays a text box D to the consumer. The text box D may contain details regarding the transaction such as the amount total of the purchase and or the shipping address of the purchaser. The text box D may also allow the consumer to change the shipping address.

Referring now to once the consumer confirms that all the purchasing information is correct and follows through with the purchase an example user interface E is then displayed to the consumer. The example user interface E includes a text box E that informs the consumer that the transaction is successful and that the consumer need not login to the third party payment platform for subsequent purchases. The text box E may also optionally inform the consumer that an electronic confirmation such as an email confirmation regarding the purchase may be sent to the consumer soon.

As discussed above with reference to if the consumer does not have an account with the third party payment provider and does not wish to register for an account he may be given a temporary guest login to complete the transaction. An example of this situation is graphically illustrated in in which a user interface F displays a text box F to the consumer. The text box F may inform the consumer that a guest PIN or temporary secret code has been sent to the consumer s mobile phone or email address and the consumer is prompted to enter that guest PIN. Once the correct PIN is entered the purchasing transaction may resume in a similar manner as discussed above with reference to .

On the other hand if the consumer does not have an account with the third party payment provider but is ready to register for an account an example user interface G may be displayed to the consumer as illustrated in . The user interface G may include a text box G that informs the consumer that additional account signup information has been sent to his mobile phone or email address. In addition the consumer may also visit a website of the third party payment provider in order to sign up for an account.

Also as discussed above with reference to the consumer may be given an option to log in to the third party payment provider automatically for the subsequent purchases. This aspect of the present disclosure is graphically illustrated in which asks the consumer such question in a text box H. If the consumer chooses yes then he no long needs to perform a login to the third party payment provider every time. Instead his login information will be remembered for subsequent purchases.

The discussions above pertain to the purchase of a single item as an example. According to the various aspects of the present disclosure the consumer may indeed purchase multiple products in the same transaction. is a flowchart of a method that illustrates an example process flow for performing a purchasing transaction involving multiple products.

Referring to the method includes a step in which one or more products are displayed on TV. This step is similar to the step of . For example as a live TV program is being displayed to the consumer the consumer is notified that a product may be available. The product may be associated with or embedded as an element within the TV program.

The method continues with a decision step to determine whether or not the consumer is a known user once the consumer decides to purchase the product. In some embodiments the consumer may add the product to a virtual or digital shopping cart. As the consumer performs this transaction the method will determine if the consumer is a known user e.g. a consumer who has been authenticated previously or is a new user. If the answer from the decision step is no meaning the user has not been previously authenticated then the method proceeds to a step to authenticate the consumer. The execution of the step may involve substantially similar processes as those discussed above with reference to where a consumer is authenticated for the first time.

On the other hand if the decision step confirms that the consumer had already been authenticated as a known user for the third party payment provider the method proceeds to step in which the product selected by the consumer user is added to his digital shopping cart. The cart may or may not include other products previously selected and added to the cart by the consumer. In some embodiments the products in the cart may be displayed as a list and the consumer may be able to scroll up and down the list to view the details of each product. The consumer may also be given the option to edit the cart for example changing the quantity of each item in the cart.

The method then proceeds to a decision step to determine if the consumer is ready to check out. If the answer is no the method then proceeds to a step in which the products in the cart are saved for a later checkout and the consumer may resume watching the TV program. If the decision step determines that the consumer is ready to check out the method proceeds to a decision step to determine if the consumer has been authenticated. If the answer is no the method proceeds to a step in which the consumer is authenticated in a procedure similar to that discussed above with reference to . For example the consumer may be authenticated using a mobile phone number and a PIN linked to the third party payment provider account or using the correct combination of a username and a password.

If the consumer had already been authenticated or after the consumer finishes the authenticated process in step the method proceeds to a step in which the purchasing details are verified with the user. For example the consumer may be prompted to confirm that the quantity and price of the products in the cart are correct and or that his shipping address is correct. After the consumer confirms the purchasing details the method proceeds to a step to complete the purchase.

The method discussed above merely illustrates an example process flow and is not intended to be limiting and additional steps may be performed before during or after the steps of the method . To facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the method are provided to graphically illustrate some embodiments of the method .

Referring to an example user interface A is displayed. The user interface A is similar to the user interface A of . For example it may be a screenshot of a TV program that the consumer is watching. And similarly an offer may be communicated to the consumer at various points of the TV program. The offer may be displayed as a text box or a dialog box A which contains a brief description of the product being offered. The text box A gives the consumer an option to add the product to a digital or virtual shopping cart or save it for a later purchase.

Referring now to an example user interface B is displayed to the consumer after the consumer adds the product to the cart. The user interface E shows a text box B in which the consumer s shopping cart is displayed. The consumer may be able to scroll through the shopping cart to view the details associated with each item in the cart. In some embodiments the consumer may be able to edit the shopping cart such as changing the quantity of the items in the cart. The consumer can initiate the checkout process or alternatively save one or more items in the cart for a later purchase.

Referring now to as the consumer initiates the checkout process an example user interface C is displayed. The user interface C includes a text box C that prompts the consumer to enter his login information for a third party payment provider. In some embodiments the consumer can choose to enter a mobile number and a PIN to authenticate himself. In other embodiments the consumer can choose to enter a username and a password to authenticate himself.

Referring now to the transaction details are displayed to the consumer in a text box D in an example user interface D. The consumer is asked to verify details such as the consumer s shipping address and or the price quantity in the cart. Thereafter in an example user interface E includes a text box E that displays a confirmation for the purchasing transaction.

In all the above examples the consumer may interact with the TV for example selecting different options or inputting text in a variety of ways. In some embodiments the consumer may use a remote control to perform the transaction. In other embodiments the consumer may use a gesture based mechanism to perform the transaction. The gesture based mechanism may include a sensor device coupled to the TV where the sensor device can detect gestures or physical movements of the consumer and interpret the corresponding meaning of the gestures. For example a particular hand waving motion may correspond to an enter or yes command while a different hand waving motion may correspond to a cancel or no command. In yet other embodiments the TV screen itself may be touch sensitive so that the user can interact with the TV set through the touch sensitive controls.

Compared to conventional shopping experiences the purchasing scheme described above offers the consumers greater flexibility and a more interactive shopping experience. For example the products can be offered to the consumer throughout a TV program that the consumer is watching. If the consumer is interested in a product he need not leave his couch or bed and go make a phone call or log online to contact the merchant. Rather he can browse through the available products and make a purchase while he is watching the TV program. Of course the user may have the option to pause the TV program as he is making the purchase. The user may also choose to configure the notification icon of a product availability to be unobtrusive so as to not diminish his TV viewing experience. In addition the TV program containing offers may or may not be live. The consumer may still interact with the TV the same way even if the TV program is on tape delay or is a digitally pre recorded program.

Moreover while the consumer may initiate and complete the purchase through a TV he is not required to do so. In some embodiments the consumer may just manipulate his third party payment shopping cart e.g. add or delete items to his cart by interacting with the TV and he can finish the checkout process on any computing device later for example after he has finished watching the TV program. Stated differently the consumer can initiate a commercial transaction through TV but he is not necessarily required to finish that commercial transaction through TV.

Furthermore since the products being offered are integrated into or embedded within the TV program e.g. an article of clothing worn by the lead actress or a car driven by the actor the product is discretely and yet efficiently advertised to the consumer. As such the consumer may be able to better gauge his interest level of the product. For example the consumer might decide that the dress or jewelry worn by the actress would look very good on his wife or that the soundtrack from the movie is really enjoyable. Because the consumer can more accurately gauge his interest level in the product and because he can make a purchase instantly using the TV the consumer is more likely to follow through with the purchase. Hence the type of advertising platform discussed above not only offers convenience to the consumers but also offers advantages to merchants as well.

The discussions above have used an example of a single user conducting a transaction securely through a TV. However a single user case is merely one of many example scenarios according to various aspects of the present disclosure and some additional multi user scenarios are briefly discussed below.

In one multi user scenario a father logs into his XBOX account and decides to make a purchase in the XBOX market place. The father chooses a sports game that he would like to play with his son over the weekend. On a payment option screen he may select to pay with a third party provider with which he has an account. This may be the first time that the father is using his third party payment provider account in the XBOX marketplace. After the father enters his security credentials to log in the third party payment provider he is given an option to add an account for other eligible users. The father may then set up an account for his son and enters the required information for his son s account. The father can then fund his son s account after it is set up. Thereafter the son may make purchases from the XBOX marketplace using the balance in his new account with the third party payment provider. The son may also make purchases through the TV in the interactive manner described above.

In another multi user scenario user A and user B are roommates living together and thus share the same TV though the TV may be owned by either the user A or the user B . Suppose that while watching a TV program together the user A sees a product that she would like to purchase but is not sure as to how to conduct the purchasing transaction. The user A asks the user B to make the purchase for her. The user B initiates the transaction using the third party payment provider and during the login process the user B is given an option to switch users. By choosing this option a mobile phone number for the user A may be entered. If the user A does not have an account with the third party payment provider the TV will display a notification message indicating that a message has been sent to the user A s phone. The user A may then set up her account with the third party payment provider which may be done using any suitable computing device. Thereafter both the users A and B may conduct purchasing transactions interactively through the TV in the manner described above. During the purchasing transaction the users A and B may switch back and forth between their third party payment provider accounts depending on who is making the purchase.

The infrastructure of implementing the interactive shopping through a TV will now be described. Referring to a simplified block diagram of a media infrastructure is illustrated. The media infrastructure includes a TV device . The TV device may include a television set which may be an analog TV set or a digital TV set. The TV device may also include a set top box STB .

The TV device includes software e.g. STB software that supports various applications. Examples of STB software include applications based on an Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format specification EBIF . EBIF is a multimedia content format defined by a specification developed under the OpenCable project. The primary purpose of the EBIF content format is to represent an optimized collection of widget and byte code specifications that define one or more multimedia pages similar to web pages but specialized for use within an enhanced television or interactive television system. An EBIF resource file i.e. a sequence of bytes that conforms to the EBIF content format forms the primary information contained in an ETV Application. An ETV User Agent acquires decodes presents widgets and executes actions contained in an EBIF resource in order to present a multimedia page to an end user.

Of course EBIF is just one of the many ways that can enable the media infrastructure . Other standards or specifications may also be used to enable an interactive TV infrastructure.

In the embodiment illustrated in a TV commerce app is implemented as software on the TV device . The TV commerce app may pertain to one or more specific merchants. In some embodiments the TV commerce app comes pre installed on the TV device . In other embodiments the user of the TV device may install the TV commerce app after the TV device has been purchased and installed. The TV commerce app may be invoked when the TV is displaying a TV program. For example as a video stream comes through the TV device there may be one or more trigger points embedded in the video stream. These trigger points may be capable of invoking one or more specific TV commerce apps such as the TV commerce app .

A third party payment provider component is also implemented as software on the TV device . The third party payment provider component will handle security tasks such as verifying username and passwords or PINs or the temporary login information entered by the user. The third party payment provider component can also handle user presentation. The third party payment provider component communicates securely with the third party payment provider. For example the third party payment provider component may encrypt the communication taking place between itself and external devices. In some embodiments the third party payment provider and a vendor for the TV device may agree on public keys bundled with a library of the third party payment provider. The third party payment provider component interacts with device specific intelligence and collects device data.

In some embodiments the third party payment provider component includes a front end component that resides on a TV set and a back end component that resides on a set top box. The front end component is configured for direct interaction with the user. For example the front end component may display the various user interfaces discussed above in association with or . The front end component may instruct the TV set to display a text box of 300 pixels by 500 pixels with the texts being a certain font. The back end component is a lower level component and handles tasks such as encryption algorithms and encryption keys. In some embodiments the back end component includes a library for example an EBIF library. The user may interact with the front end component and the front end component communicates with the back end component and the back end component communicates with a third party payment provider server discussed later.

Similar to the TV commerce app the third party payment provider component may also be pre installed on the TV device or may be installed on the TV device afterwards. The third party payment provider component interacts with the TV commerce app to facilitate an interactive commercial transaction through TV as discussed above.

The TV device may also contain a program guide app and firmware . The program guide app is shown herein to illustrate the internal workings of a cable set top box. The firmware is a component that exists in many set top boxes and that controls the communication and other functions of the set top box. The firmware may interact with the third party payment provider component in order to perform certain tasks of the set top box.

The media infrastructure includes a network . In the embodiment illustrated in the network is a cable TV network. The cable TV network includes a plurality of homes . A TV device like the TV device may be implemented inside each of the homes . The homes may be divided into different groups where the homes in each group share a common node . For example as illustrated in a subset of the homes A may be connected to a node A through common cabling while a different subset of the homes B may be connected to a node B through common cabling.

In a hierarchical manner a group of the nodes are then connected to a data equipment . The data equipment is then connected to a data center . Data communication may take place between the nodes and the data equipment and between the data equipment and the data center . The data center may generate media content or media programs by itself or may receive media programs generated by a media provider not illustrated herein and relay the media programs to the TV device which is done through the data equipment the node A and the homes A. The nodes the data equipment and the data center may contain suitable machines or equipment for carrying or delivering the media content. For example the nodes may include multiplexers for multiplexing or consolidating signals. The data equipment and the data center may include may include computer servers for processing signals.

The cable TV network serves as a bridge for connecting the TV device to the Internet since the TV device itself otherwise lacks Internet connection capabilities. It is also understood that other types of networks may also be used to provide Internet access to the TV device . For example a satellite TV network may be used in place of the cable TV network . The satellite TV network may include appropriate equipment such as satellite dishes transmitters receivers etc. Other alternative networks such as IPTV networks may also be implemented but they are not discussed in detail herein for reasons of simplicity.

In the embodiment illustrated in the data center communicates with a third party payment provider end point . In some embodiments the third party payment provider end point includes an application programming interface API system built with intelligence to understand what device s is interacting with it. Based on the device data and type the third party payment provider end point will present users with the appropriate presentation and security challenge. Also based on device data and type the third party payment provider end point will allow or deny certain types of transaction. The third party payment provider end point may also apply the corresponding risk models rules based on the device data and type. The third party payment provider end point may include one or more computer or data servers for processing these various tasks.

As examples the third party payment provider end point includes software modules or software engines such as a user authentication software module a risk assessment software module and a core money transaction software module . The user authentication software module can interact with the third party payment provider component to verify the security credentials entered by a user. The risk assessment software module can monitor the purchasing history of a user and detect anomalous purchases. For example if the user has never bought any merchandise exceeding 100 dollars then a supposed purchase of 5 000 dollars may be flagged by the risk assessment software module which can then send an alert to the user and or appropriate financial institutions. The core money transaction software module represents a merchant infrastructure in some embodiments. For example the core money transaction software module may facilitate the movement and transfer of funds between a merchant and users accounts.

It is understood that the third party payment provider end point may include a plurality of additional software or hardware modules that are designed and configured to accomplish specific tasks but they are not discussed herein for reasons of simplicity.

As discussed above a user may stream media programs to his TV device from a media content or media program provider. For example the media programs may be streamed from the data center to the data equipment to the node to the home and then to the TV device . In some embodiments the video stream is an analog video stream. Offer trigger mechanisms are embedded at various points in the analog video stream. For example the media program may be a commercial for a clothing apparel. The trigger mechanisms communicate with the TV commerce app . In some embodiments the TV commerce app is customized for a specific type of media program and the TV commerce app actively listens for the right trigger mechanism as the media program is being streamed to the TV device .

Once a trigger mechanism is identified the TV commerce app may display a small icon or a larger pop up window on a viewing screen of the TV device which indicates to the user watching the TV program that an offer to purchase one or more specific types of cloth apparel is available. When the user is ready to make a purchase based on the displayed offer the TV commerce app interacts with the third party payment provider component to facilitate the transaction. For example the TV commerce app may request the third party payment provider component to display a login screen overlying the TV program screen itself so that the user can enter his login credentials i.e. PIN username password etc for the third party payment provider.

Data which may contain the user s login credentials and or other sensitive information such as the user s credit card or bank account numbers is then sent to the third party payment provider end point for verification. As discussed above since the TV device itself lacks Internet connectivity the data is delivered to the third party provider end point through the network . In the embodiment illustrated in the data is routed outside the home inside which the TV device is located and travels through the node the data equipment and thereafter the data center before eventually reaching the third party payment provider end point . The node the data equipment and the data center may each be referred to as an intermediate hop since they are intermediate relay points between the TV device and the third party payment provider end point .

When the third party payment provider end point receives the data from the TV device the third party payment provider end point determines whether the credentials entered by the user matches with an existing user s account. If not the third party payment provider end point may send a message back to the TV device through the network to prompt the user to either re enter his login information or to register for an account with the third party payment provider end point in case the user has not registered for one yet. If the user credentials are correct the third party payment provider end point may grant the user s authentication request to log in to the server of the third party payment provider end point . The third party payment provider end point may then send the TV device data that contains an authentication permission. For example the authentication permission may include an authentication token. The authentication token allows the user operating the TV device to gain access to the third party payment provider end point but may impose limitations on such access. For example the authentication token may restrict such access to a specific time period or other session related elements or even for a specific device type.

After the user has been authenticated the third party payment provider component may also display a user authorization screen to collect the user s authorization for the purchasing transaction. The relevant request is sent to the third party payment provider end point along with the authentication token. The third party payment provider end point may respond back with an authorization token. The third party payment provider component specifically the back end component may then make a request along with the authorization token to the third party payment provider end point to execute the payment

Thus it can be seen that the communication between the TV device and the third party payment provider end point is a two way communication as each entity may send and receive data from the other. As discussed above such data is delivered through the intermediate hops of the network . Due to these intermediate hops high levels of security measures will be taken to ensure that the data is not compromised while it is in transit from the TV device to the third party payment provider end point or vice versa. In various embodiments these security measures include channel encryption and or message encryption. Also in certain embodiments the communication between the data center and the third party payment provider end point is based on client mutual authentication for example through a Secure Sockets Layer SSL handshake so as to authenticate the data center. Also because of the intermediate hops the third party payment provider end point will possess intelligence to know the specific route taken by the data to reach the third party payment provider end point .

Based on the discussions above it can be seen that one aspect of the media infrastructure involves implementing a secure digital technology component on a TV device which may includes a set top box and enabling the digital technology component to securely communicate with a server on the Internet. The communication takes place by propagating data through a network with intermediate hops without any of the intermediate hops looking side or inspecting the data. Stated differently the intermediate hops of the network merely forwards the data to its next destination. In various embodiments the secure digital technology component is the third party payment provider component which may contain Internet related security mechanisms whereas the intermediate hops of the network include the nodes the data equipment and the data center when the network is a cable TV network.

Referring to the media infrastructure includes a TV device which contains a TV commerce app a third party payment provider component a program guide and firmware . The media infrastructure also includes homes nodes the data equipment the data center and the third party payment provider end point . Similar to the media infrastructure of the nodes the data equipment and the data center are parts of a layered analog media network. Unlike the media infrastructure however the TV device is Internet capable. The TV device directly communicates with the third party payment provider end point without any terminations on any of the intermediate hops e.g. the nodes the data equipment the data center . In some embodiments the TV device communicates with the third party payment provider end point in a secure manner such as through a SSL handshake. And since there are no terminations in the intermediate hops the security measures herein may not be as strict as in the media infrastructure . For example channel encryption alone may be sufficient for the communication between the TV device and the third party payment provider endpoint .

Thus according to various aspects of the present disclosure a user or a plurality of users is allowed to make an instant purchase from a TV device without requiring an account set up or the use of a personal computer or other computing device . In certain embodiments a third party payment provider digital component based on an STB ecosystem e.g. EBIF Application is embedded into STB based on EBIF runtime . Changes are made to the EBIF specifications to enable security and to embed the interactive functionality into runtime. The interactive functionality enables an end user to directly make payments through a TV. These aspects of the present disclosure may involve one or more of the following elements 

These elements offer enhanced security e.g. site key and message encryption and allow full control of the user interaction including multiple users on a single device.

According to various aspects of the present disclosure an example use case scenario for conducting a simple commercial transaction through a TV device is described below with the following steps 

In the manner described above the third party payment provider is able to provide secure on device payments within a TV device ecosystem e.g. set top boxes . Thus the users will be able to purchase products and services directly from their TV and TV devices without any further interaction with their computing devices e.g. PC laptop or mobile phones .

According to various aspects of the present disclosure a single digital wallet can also be used to conduct electronic transactions across with different merchants and across different platforms. Such digital wallet may be referred to as a white label wallet.

Traditionally when a user or consumer sees a product that he wishes to buy he can go to that merchant who is offering the product and set up an account with the merchant. His subsequent transactions with that merchant may be done through this account with the merchant. However if the user wishes to buy a product from a different merchant the account he set up with the first merchant is useless and he would have to set up a different account with the second merchant to conduct transactions with the second merchant.

Here the user can set up an account with the third party payment provider. Once that account is set up he may use that account to conduct different transactions with different merchants across different platforms. For example say the user is watching a TV program and sees a first product e.g. clothing worn by the actor that he wishes to buy from a first merchant. He can then log in to the third party payment provider in the manner described above to complete the purchase. If the user does not have an account with the third party payment provider he only needs to set it up once. Afterwards his login information can be remembered by the TV device for example by the set top box for future transactions.

Thereafter while watching the same TV program or even a different TV program if the user sees another product e.g. a motorcycle that the actor is riding that he wishes to buy from a different merchant the same login information for the user can be used to access his account with the third party payment provider again. In some embodiments the user need not re enter his login information if it is already remembered. The third party payment provider may complete the user s purchase with the second merchant seamlessly without requiring the user to supply additional data thereby simplifying the transaction for the user.

In some cases the user may also wish to supply other types of payment information other than his account access information with the third party payment provider. For example the user may elect to enter his credit card number or a band account number through the TV device. However the third party payment provider may still be the back engine that operates behind the scenes to facilitate the transaction. For example if the user has entered a credit card number from the user s perspective it is the credit card company who is handling the transaction with a given merchant. In actuality that merchant may delegate the responsibilities of handling the transaction to the third party payment provider. The third party payment provider may then forward the credit card information supplied by the user to a suitable credit card network. Similarly had the user provided a bank account number or an account number with another financial institution the third party payment provider may forward the bank account number to the appropriate bank or financial institution. This is done without requiring the user to understand what is going on behind the scenes. In other words the user may be interacting with the third party payment provider without realizing that he is doing so. In this manner the third party payment provider serves as a one size fits all payment platform.
