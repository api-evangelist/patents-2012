With proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones users are enjoying numerous applications of numerous kinds that can be run on their devices. One popular type of such application is mapping and navigation applications that allow user to browse maps and get route directions. Despite their popularity these mapping and navigation applications have shortcomings with their user interfaces and features that cause inconvenience to the users.

Some embodiments of the invention provide an integrated mapping application that includes several useful modalities including location browsing map searching route identifying and route navigating operations. These operations are complex tasks that while complementary each have very different user interface UI requirements. The mapping application in some embodiments has a novel UI design that addresses the difficult challenges of integrating the needed controls for each of its different modalities into a seamless and cohesive application user interface. The novel UI design and the application are defined to be executed by a device that has a touch sensitive screen that displays the output of the application. In some embodiments this device has a multi touch interface for allowing a user to provide touch and gestural inputs through the screen to interact with the application.

In some embodiments a goal of the mapping application UI is that on screen controls are kept to a minimum in order to display as much of the interactive map as possible. One element in this design is a button cluster that floats on top of the content itself rather than taking up the full width of the screen as typical in phone UI elements. Additionally this cluster adapts to the task at hand adjusting its contents in an animated fashion when a user moves between the different modalities e.g. between browsing searching routing and navigating . This common element with an adaptive nature enables the mapping application to optimize for different tasks while maintaining a consistent look and interaction model while moving between those tasks.

One example of an adaptive floating control in some embodiments is the list control. When there are opportunities to display a list of items be it a list of instructions in a route or a list of search results when multiple results are found for a given query the mapping application of some embodiments displays a list button as one of the floating controls. Tapping the list button brings up a modal list view in some embodiments. Having a modal list view keeps the mapping application simple and the map front and center. In some embodiments the list view itself is adapted and optimized for the type of list being displayed in that search results will be displayed with star ratings when available and route steps will include instructional arrows.

Another floating control is a control for viewing map or inspecting a route in three dimensions 3D . The mapping application provides the 3D control as a quick mechanism of getting into and out of 3D. This control also serves as 1 an indicator that the current view is a 3D view and 2 an indicator that a 3D perspective is available for a given map view e.g. a map view that is zoomed out might not have a 3D view available .

In addition to the 3D control the mapping application of some embodiments allows a user to transition a map view from a two dimensional 2D presentation to a 3D presentation through gestural inputs of the multi touch interface of the device. For instance through a two finger gestural input the user can be made to experience pushing down a 2D map view into a 3D map view or pulling up a 3D map view into a 2D map view. This can also be thought of as pulling down a virtual camera from a 2D directly from above view into a 3D side angle view through the two finger gesture. As further described below the 3D view of the map is generated in some embodiments by rendering the map view from a particular position that can be conceptually thought of as the position of a virtual camera that is capturing the map view.

Through gestural inputs the mapping application allows a user to also rotate a 2D or 3D map in some embodiments. The mapping application in some embodiments is a vector mapping application that allows for direct manipulations such as rotation and 2D 3D manipulations of the map while browsing it. However some of the effects to the map can be disorienting. Without an easy way to get back to north up orientation i.e. an orientation where the north direction is aligned with the top of the device some users may have difficulty interacting with the map views. To solve this the mapping application of some embodiments provides an unobtrusive floating compass control on the map that serves both as an indicator that points to north and as a button to restore a north up orientation. To further minimize clutter on the map the mapping application only shows the button only in a limited number of situations such as when the map is rotated etc. .

In order to minimize the number of on screen controls certain less frequently used actions are placed in a secondary UI screen behind a page curl that is displayed on a map view that is provided by the application. In some embodiments the page curl is permanently displayed on at least some of the map views that the application provides. For instance in some embodiments the application displays the page curl permanently on the initial map view that it provides for allowing a user to browse or search a location or to identify a route. In some embodiments the page curl is a controllable UI item that has different appearances in different embodiments such as a button a curled up corner of a page a highlighted corner of a map etc. The page curl 1 indicates the location of another set of controls that are conceptually behind the current view and 2 when selected directs the application to present an animation that peels off the current view to display another view that shows the other set of controls. The mapping application allows the user to control the page curl using a number of different gestures e.g. selecting dragging tapping sliding rotating etc. . In some embodiments the mapping application displays an animation of the page being folded lift up and or curled in different combination of angles and rotation as the user provides different gestural inputs as if the user is manipulating a sheet of paper by grabbing a corner of the sheet.

The use of the page curl allows the application to display more of the map while offering an unobtrusive way to access further functionality that is provided by the other set of controls. Additionally in some embodiments the application does not use the page curl in map views where the additional functionality is deemed to be inappropriate to the task at hand. For instance in some embodiments the application does not display this page curl while presenting the map view that is used during navigation.

In some embodiments the application displays the page curl for every map view that the application provides. In other embodiments the application does not display the page curl with every map view that the application provides. For instance the application of these embodiments does not display the page curl when a map view is used during navigation. However in some embodiments the page curl returns when the application is showing the overview of the route during navigation.

The search field of the mapping application in some embodiments is another UI tool that the application employs to make the transition between the different modalities seamless. In some embodiments a user can initiate a search by tapping in the search field. This directs the application to present an animation that 1 presents an on screen keyboard and 2 opens a search table full of invaluable completions. This table has some important subtleties. When the search field is tapped and before the terms are edited or when the search field is empty the table contains a list of recents which in some embodiments are recent searches and route directions that the user has requested. This makes it very easy to quickly bring up recently accessed results.

After any edit in the search field the table is filled with search completions both from local sources e.g. bookmarks contacts recent searches recent route directions etc. and remote servers. Some embodiments however include recent route directions only when the user has not yet entered any text into the search field. Once text is entered the mapping application removes recent route directions from the search completions table. The incorporation of the user s contact card into the search interface adds additional flexibility to the design. When showing recents a route from current location to the user s home is always offered in some embodiments while it is offered in the contexts that are deemed to be appropriate in other embodiments. Also when the search term matches at least part of an address label e.g. ork for Work the application presents the user s labeled address as a completion in the search table in some embodiments. Together these behaviors make the search UI a very powerful way to get results onto a map from a variety of sources. In addition to allowing a user to initiate a search the presence of the text field in the primary map view in some embodiments also allows users to see the query corresponding to search results on the map and to remove those search results by clearing the query.

Another way that the mapping application tightly integrates the search and route identification experience is by providing several different ways to get directions. As mentioned above the search table provides quick access to recently used routes. For any location selected on the map view the mapping application in some embodiments also presents an info display banner e.g. a window that displays a quick route navigation UI control e.g. button that fetches a route e.g. a driving route from the current location to that pin without ever leaving the map view. In addition the mapping application also provides a selectable direction UI control e.g. button on the main map view e.g. on the top left corner which when selected presents a modal directions editing interface that enables the user to request more customized routes such as routes that do not begin from the current location or a walking route instead of just driving routes. In some embodiments the mapping application provides several different selectable routes based on a route query that it receives through the direction UI control. In such embodiments the user can then select one of the routes. In some embodiments one of the routes is presented as a default selected route and the user can change the selected route to be one of the other presented routes. It should be noted that while neither the route history entries in the search field nor quick route navigation control perform actions that cannot be achieved with the direction item they serve as important accelerators that make it much easier to obtain the most commonly desired routes.

Once route directions have been obtained they remain present until they are expressly cleared. This enables the mapping application to enter a mode that is optimized for navigation. The navigation mode has many novel features. One novel feature is that at any time while navigating the user can move between a full screen mode that presents a display view optimized for turn by turn directions and an overview mode that presents a display view of the remaining route that better accommodates browsing. Some embodiments also allow for a search to be performed while navigating in the overview mode. For instance some embodiments provide a pull down handle that allows the search field to be pulled into the overview display. Alternatively or conjunctively some embodiments allow for searches to be performed during navigation through a voice recognition input of the device of some embodiments.

Continuity between the overview mode and the full screen mode is achieved by an in place transition in the map and a constant set of controls. To enter full screen mode the application in some embodiments 1 automatically hides the floating controls and a bar containing UI controls along the top and 2 completely uncurls the map. During the full screen mode the application restricts touch interaction with the map. In some embodiments a tap is required to access the controls that were automatically hidden and even then they are adapted towards a full screen navigation look with a prominent display of the ETA in the bar along the top.

The mapping application of some embodiments allows the user to stop navigation in both overview and full screen modes by selecting a control to end navigation at any time while navigating. The mapping application of some embodiments also allows the user to modify the turn by turn navigation view to see alternative three dimensional 3D views or to present a two dimensional 2D view at any time while navigating. In some embodiments the 3D turn by turn navigation is an animated rendering of navigated route that is rendered from the vantage point of a virtual camera that traverses along the direction of the route based on the traversal direction and speed of the user which in some embodiments is captured by directional data e.g. GPS data triangulated cell tower data etc. associated with the device.

While navigating the mapping application of some embodiments allows a user to change the position of the virtual camera i.e. the position from which the navigated route is rendered through gestural input on the device s screen. Movement of the virtual camera i.e. movement of the position from which the route is rendered allows the mapping application to present alternative 3D view. Some embodiments even use the virtual camera to render a top down 2D view for the turn by turn navigation while other embodiments render the top down 2D view by zooming in and out of a 2D map. In some embodiments the mapping application presents a 3D button that serves both as 3D indicator and 3D initiator toggle.

Different embodiments provide different gestural inputs to adjust the 3D 2D view during turn by turn navigation. In some embodiments the gestural input is a two finger pinching spreading operation to adjust the zoom level. This adjustment of the zoom level inherently adjusts the position and rotation of the camera with respect to the route direction and thereby changes the 3D perspective view of the route direction. Alternatively other embodiments provide other gestural inputs e.g. a finger drag operation that change the position of the camera instead of or in addition to the zoom operation. In yet other embodiments a gestural input e.g. a finger drag operation momentarily changes the viewing direction of the camera to allow a user to momentarily glance to a side of the navigated route. In these embodiments the application returns the camera to its previous view along the route after a short time period.

The mapping application of some embodiments provide realistic looking road signs that are used during navigation and during the browsing of an identified route. In some embodiments the signs are textured images that bear a strong resemblance to actual highway signs and they include instructional arrows text shields and distance. The mapping application of some embodiments presents a wide number of variants in a large number of different contexts. For maneuvers that are close together a secondary sign is presented hanging just beneath the primary sign. Signs are presented in different colors according to the regional norms in some embodiments. Also as one maneuver is passed during navigation the mapping application animates the sign away with a motion that mimics a sign passing overhead on the highway. When a maneuver is approached the mapping application draws attention to the sign with a subtle animation e.g. a shimmer across the entire sign .

As mentioned above the mapping application of some embodiments uses the realistic looking road signs to provide a novel method of browsing a route that it has identified. For instance in some embodiments the mapping application allows a user to select and scroll through the signs of the junctures along an identified route when it presents the identified route to the user. As the user scrolls through each sign the portion of the route associated with the currently in focus sign is presented or highlighted e.g. through color highlighting or through another geometry e.g. a circle or other mark marking the portion . Alternatively or conjunctively the user can scroll through each sign by selecting different junctures of the route in order to view the sign associated with that juncture. Some of these embodiments provide this interaction only for routes that are not defined between a user s current location and a destination. In other words these embodiments do not provide this browsing experience when a route is presented that connects the user s current location to a destination. Other embodiments however provide the route browsing experience through the road signs in other or all other contexts in which a route is displayed.

The above described features as well as some other features of the mapping application of some embodiments are further described below. In the description above and below many of the features are described as part of an integrated mapping application that provides novel location browsing locating searching route identifying and route navigating operations. However one of ordinary skill will realize that these novel operations are performed in other embodiments by applications that do not perform all of these operations or perform other operations in addition to these operations.

The preceding Summary is intended to serve as a brief introduction to some embodiments of the invention. It is not meant to be an introduction or overview of all inventive subject matter disclosed in this document. The Detailed Description that follows and the Drawings that are referred to in the Detailed Description will further describe the embodiments described in the Summary as well as other embodiments. Accordingly to understand all the embodiments described by this document a full review of the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawings is needed. Moreover the claimed subject matters are not to be limited by the illustrative details in the Summary Detailed Description and the Drawing but rather are to be defined by the appended claims because the claimed subject matters can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the subject matters.

In the following detailed description of the invention numerous details examples and embodiments of the invention are set forth and described. However it will be clear and apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth and that the invention may be practiced without some of the specific details and examples discussed.

Some embodiments of the invention provide an integrated mapping application that includes several useful modalities including location browsing map searching route identifying and route navigating operations. The mapping application in some embodiments is defined to be executed by a device that has a touch sensitive screen that displays the output of the application. In some embodiments this device has a multi touch interface for allowing a user to provide touch and gestural inputs through the screen to interact with the application. Examples of such a device are smartphones e.g. iPhone sold by Apple Inc. phones operating the Android operating system phones operating the Windows 8 operating system etc. .

Several detailed embodiments of the invention are described below. Section I describes UI controls and map browsing experience that the mapping application of some embodiments provides. Section II then describes behaviors of the novel search field of the mapping application. Section III follows with a description of a novel UI for presenting different types of details information about a location. Next Section IV describes several different ways for the user to get route directions from the mapping application. Section V then describes different operational modes of the integrated mapping application of some embodiments. Section VI describes example electronic systems with which some embodiments of the invention are implemented. Finally Section VII describes a map service operating environment.

The second stage shows the device after the mapping application has opened. As shown in this stage the mapping application s UI has a starting page that in some embodiments 1 displays a map of the current location of the device and 2 several UI controls arranged in a top bar and as floating controls. As shown in the floating controls include a position control a 3D control and a page curl control while the top bar includes a direction control a search field and a bookmark control .

The direction control opens a page through which a user can request a route to be identified between a starting location and an ending location. As further described below this control is one of three mechanisms through which the mapping application can be directed to identify and display a route between two locations the two other mechanisms are 1 a control in an information banner that is displayed for a selected item in the map and 2 recent routes identified by the device that are displayed in the search field . Accordingly the information banner control and the search field are two UI tools that the application employs to make the transition between the different modalities seamless.

In some embodiments a user can initiate a search by tapping in the search field . This directs the application to present an animation that 1 presents an on screen keyboard and 2 opens a search table full of invaluable completions. This table has some important subtleties. When the search field is tapped and before the terms are edited or when the search field is empty the table contains a list of recents which in some embodiments are recent searches and route directions that the user has requested. This makes it very easy to quickly bring up recently accessed results.

After any edit in the search field the table is filled with search completions both from local sources e.g. bookmarks contacts recent searches recent route directions etc. and remote servers. Some embodiments however include recent route directions only when the user has not yet entered any text into the search field. Once text is entered the mapping application removes recent route directions from the search completions table. The incorporation of the user s contact card into the search interface adds additional flexibility to the design. When showing recents a route from current location to the user s home is always offered in some embodiments while it is offered in the contexts that are deemed to be appropriate in other embodiments. Also when the search term matches at least part of an address label e.g. ork for Work the application presents the user s labeled address as a completion in the search table in some embodiments. Together these behaviors make the search UI a very powerful way to get results onto a map from a variety of sources. In addition to allowing a user to initiate a search the presence of the text field in the primary map view in some embodiments also allows users to see the query corresponding to search results on the map and to remove those search results by clearing the query.

The bookmark control e.g. button allows location and routes to be bookmarked by the application. The position control allows the current position of the device to be specifically noted on the map. Once this position control is selected the application maintains the current position of the device in the center of the map as the device is moving in some embodiments. In some embodiments it can also identify the direction to which the device currently points. The mapping application of some embodiments identifies the location of the device using the coordinates e.g. longitudinal altitudinal and latitudinal coordinates in the GPS signal that the device receives at the location of the device. Alternatively or conjunctively the mapping application uses other methods e.g. cell tower triangulation to compute the current location.

The 3D control is a control for viewing map or inspecting a route in three dimensions 3D . The mapping application provides the 3D control as a quick mechanism of getting into and out of 3D. This control also serves as 1 an indicator that the current view is a 3D view and 2 an indicator that a 3D perspective is available for a given map view e.g. a map view that is zoomed out might not have a 3D view available . In some embodiments the 3D control provides at least three different appearances corresponding to some of these indications. For instance the 3D control gets colored grey when the 3D view of the map is unavailable black when the 3D view is available but the map is in the 2D view and blue when the map is in the 3D view. In some embodiments the 3D control has a fourth appearance e.g. a button showing a building image or shape when the immersive 3D map presentation is available at a given zoom level. Immersive and non immersive 3D presentations are described further in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702 entitled Rendering Maps concurrently filed with this application. This concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702 is incorporated herein by reference.

The page curl control is a control that allows the application to minimize the number of on screen controls by placing certain less frequently used actions in a secondary UI screen which is accessible through the page curl control displayed on the map. In some embodiments the page curl is permanently displayed on at least some of the map views that the application provides. For instance in some embodiments the application displays the page curl permanently on the starting page illustrated in second stage that it provides for allowing a user to browse or search a location or to identify a route.

The page curl indicates the location of another set of controls that are conceptually behind the current view. When the page curl control is selected the application presents an animation that peels off the current view to display another view that shows the other set of controls. The third stage illustrates an example of such an animation. As shown by this stage the peeling of the starting page reveals several controls which in this example are the drop pin print show traffic list standard satellite and hybrid controls. In some embodiments these controls perform the same operations as similar controls do in currently available smartphones such as iPhones operating iOS .

The use of the page curl allows the application to display more of the map while offering an unobtrusive way to access further functionality that is provided by the other set of controls. Additionally in some embodiments the application does not use the page curl in map views where the additional functionality is deemed to be inappropriate to the task at hand. For instance in some embodiments the application does not display this page curl while presenting the map view during navigation.

Also the third stage illustrates that the user drags a corner or an edge of the page to peel off the page in some embodiments. However in other embodiments the animation that peels off the page is displayed by simply tapping the page curl control without dragging the corner or the edge.

As mentioned above the mapping application in some embodiments adaptively adds and removes controls to the floating control cluster set in order to adapt this cluster to the different tasks while maintaining a consistent look and interaction model between those tasks. illustrates an example of the application adaptively modifying the floating control cluster to add and remove a list view control . This example is provided in the context of using the direction indicator to obtain a route between two locations.

This example is also provided in terms of six stages of interactions with the mapping application. The first stage illustrates the selection of the direction indicator . The second stage next illustrates the selection of a route generation control after the user has entered starting and ending locations for the route in the starting and ending fields and . The second stage also shows that the mapping application is displaying several recently used route generation requests below the fields for entering the starting and ending locations.

The third stage shows two routes and that the mapping application has identified for the provided starting and ending locations. In some embodiments the mapping application highlights one of the routes to indicate that the highlighted route is a default route that the mapping application recommends. This stage also illustrate the start of an animation that shows the list view control sliding out from under the 3D icon . When there are opportunities to display a list of items be it a list of instructions in a route or a list of search results when multiple results are found for a given query the mapping application of some embodiments displays a list control as one of the floating controls. Tapping the list control brings up a modal list view in some embodiments. Having a modal list view keeps the mapping application simple and the map front and center. In some embodiments the list view itself is adapted and optimized for the type of list being displayed in that search results will be displayed with star ratings when available and route steps will include instructional arrows.

The fourth stage shows the selection of a clear control to clear the identified routes and from the illustrated map. In response to this selection the routes and are removed from the map and an animation starts to show the list control sliding back under the 3D control as illustrated in the fifth stage . The sixth stage shows the application UI after the animation has ended and the list control has been removed from the floating control set.

Another floating control that the mapping application of some embodiments employs is a compass. illustrates an example of the application adaptively modifying the floating control cluster to add and remove a compass . This example is provided in the context of using the position control to view the current position and orientation of the device on the map presented by the device. In some embodiments the position control can cause the mapping application to operate in three different states. For instance when the position control is not selected the mapping application displays a map view. Upon receiving a first selection of the position control the mapping application shifts the map to display a region of the map that includes the current location of the device in the center of the region. The mapping application of some embodiments from then on tracks the current location of the device as the device moves.

In some embodiments the mapping application maintains the current location indicator in the center of the display area and shifts the map from one region to another as the device moves from one region to another region. Upon receiving a second selection of the position control while the mapping application is maintaining the current location of the device in the center of the displayed region the mapping application displays a simulated light projection in the map from the identified current position in the direction that the device currently faces. When the position control is selected again while the mapping application is displaying a simulated light projection the mapping application returns back to the state that was before receiving the first selection. That is the projection will disappear and the current position of the device is not tracked.

The example illustrated in this figure is provided in terms of five stages of interactions with the mapping application. The first stage illustrates that the mapping application is displaying a map region that happens to not include the current location of the device i.e. the current location indicator is not displayed in the map region .

The second stage illustrates the position control being selected once. As mentioned above the first selection of the position control will result in shifting the map to display a map region that has the current location indicator in the center. The third stage shows the result of selecting the position control . Some embodiments identify the device s current position by using the current location indicator . The current location indicator has different appearances in different embodiments. For instance the current location indicator of some embodiments has appearance of a colored dot e.g. a blue dot on the map. Identification of the current position is useful when the user has explored e.g. through gestural swipe operation the displayed map such that the device is not currently displaying the user s current location on the map.

The fourth stage illustrates the position control being selected again. The second selection of the position control in some embodiments will cause the application to display a simulated light projection in the map from the identified current position in the direction that the device currently faces. This projection helps the user identifies the direction that the device faces at any time. In some embodiments this projection always points towards the top of the device i.e. the location along which the search field is positioned while the device is held in the portrait direction .

This projection is illustrated in the fifth stage . This stage also shows that in this mode the mapping application presents a floating compass . This compass serves as an indicator that the user can use to identify the direction to the North Pole. In some embodiments this compass is in the shape of two isosceles triangles that abut at their bases with one of the triangles pointing north in a direction away from the abutting bases and having a color e.g. orange that differentiates it from the other triangle. As further described below the compass can also be used to restore a north up orientation after the user has rotated a 2D or 3D view of the map. In some embodiments the compass may remain in the map view after the mapping application receives another selection of the position control . In some embodiments the compass will not disappear until the mapping application receives a user input to remove the compass e.g. selection of the compass .

The fifth stage also shows that the map has rotated to maintain the projection s direction to the top of the device. This is because the device has been facing a different direction than the direction to the top of the device in the previous stage . As the direction of the device moves so will the direction of the compass with respect to the top of the device. The compass has moved to indicate the device is facing a northwest direction.

In some embodiments the mapping application changes the appearance of the position control once after the first selection and another time after the second selection. The fifth stage shows the appearance of the position control after the second selection which is different than the appearance of the position control after the first selection.

The mapping application in some embodiments can display a location in the map in either a 2D mode or a 3D mode. It also allows the user to browse a location in the map in either a 2D mode or a 3D mode. As mentioned above one of the floating controls is the 3D control that allows a user to view a map or inspect a route in three dimensions 3D . This control also serves as 1 an indicator that the current view is a 3D view and 2 an indicator that a 3D perspective is available for a given map view e.g. a map view that is zoomed out might not have a 3D view available .

The second stage shows a three dimensional presentation of the user s current location on the map. As mentioned above the mapping application generates the 3D view of the map in some embodiments by rendering the map view from a particular position in the three dimensional scene that can be conceptually thought of as the position of a virtual camera that is capturing the map view. This rendering will be further described below by reference to .

The third stage shows the user browsing about the current location by performing a swipe operation e.g. by dragging a finger across the touch sensitive screen of the device . This swipe operation changes the 3D map view presented on the device to display a new location on the 3D map. This new location is illustrated in the fourth stage .

In some embodiments the mapping application presents the 3D view of the map while the mapping application is operating in a navigation mode i.e. while the mapping application is presenting turn by turn navigation view . In order to provide visual distinction between the 3D view of the map during navigation and the 3D view of the map during map browsing the mapping application of some embodiments use different stylesheets that define rendered graphics differently. For instance the mapping application of some embodiments uses a stylesheet that defines grey colors for buildings white colors for roads and rounded corners for blocks in the 3D view of the map during map browsing. The mapping application of some embodiment uses a stylesheet that defines white colors for buildings grey colors for roads and sharp corners for blocks in the 3D view of the map during navigation. In some embodiments the mapping application applies these stylesheets to the same map tiles for a given region of the map. In other embodiments the mapping application applies these stylesheets to different map tiles e.g. map tiles navigation tiles etc. for the given region. Using stylesheets to render maps are further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702 entitled Rendering Maps concurrently filed with this application. This concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702. is incorporated herein by reference.

The first stage shows the virtual camera at a first perspective position pointing downwards towards the 3D scene at a first angle e.g. 30 . In this position the camera is pointing to a location that may be a stationary position of the device or of a location being explored or a moving position in front of a moving location of the device in a case where the map is used for navigation. In some embodiments the default position of the camera is to be at a particular orientation with respect to the current location but this orientation can be modified when the user rotates the map. Rendering the 3D scene from the first angle results in the 3D map view .

The second stage shows the virtual camera at a different second perspective position pointing downwards towards the scene at a larger second angle e.g. 45 . Rendering the 3D scene from this angle results in the 3D map view the buildings and the roads smaller than their illustration in the first map view .

The third stage shows the virtual camera at a top down view that looks downwards on a location on a 2D map that corresponds to the location in the 3D map scene that was used to render the 3D views and . The scene that is rendered from this perspective is the 2D map view . Unlike the 3D rendering operations of the first and second stages that in some embodiments are perspective 3D rendering operations the rendering operation in the third stage is relatively simple as it only needs to crop a portion of the 2D map that is identified by a zoom level specified by the application or the user. Accordingly the virtual camera characterization in this situation somewhat unnecessarily complicates the description of the operation of the application as cropping a portion of a 2D map is not a perspective rendering operation.

As in the third stage the mapping application in some embodiments switches from rendering a 3D scene from a particular perspective direction to cropping a 2D scene when the camera switches from the 3D perspective view to a 2D top down view. This is because in these embodiments the application is designed to use a simplified rendering operation that is easier and that does not generate unnecessary perspective artifacts. In other embodiments however the mapping application uses a perspective rendering operation to render a 3D scene from a top down virtual camera position. In these embodiments the 2D map view that is generated is somewhat different than the map view illustrated in the third stage because any object that is away from the center of the view is distorted with the distortions being more the further the object s distance from the center of the view.

The virtual camera moves along different trajectories or arcs in different embodiments. Two such trajectories and are illustrated in . In both these trajectories the camera moves in an arc and rotates more downward as the camera moves upwards on the arc. The trajectory differs from the trajectory in that in the trajectory the camera moves backwards from the current location as it moves up the arc.

While moving along one of the arcs the camera rotates to maintain a desired location on the map at the focal point of the camera. The desired location in some cases is a stationary location of the device or a stationary location that the user is browsing on the map. In other cases the desired location is a moving location in front of the moving location of the device as the user is moving with the device.

Besides or instead of having the navigation application control the camera e.g. turning from 3D to 2D when going around corners some embodiments also allow the user to adjust the position of the camera. Some embodiments allow the user to make a command gesture with two fingers to adjust the distance height and angle of the camera. Some embodiments even allow multiple types of gestures to control the camera.

The first stage shows the virtual camera at a first perspective position pointing downwards towards the 3D map at a first angle e.g. 45 degrees with respect to the horizon. In this position the camera is pointing to a location that may be a stationary position of the device or of a location being explored or a moving position in front of a moving location of the device in a case where the map is used for navigation. In some embodiments the default position of the camera is to be at a particular orientation with respect to the current location but this orientation can be modified when the user rotates the map. Rendering a 3D map view of based on the virtual camera s position results in the 3D map view .

The second stage shows the virtual camera at a different second perspective position pointing at a lower perspective towards the 3D map at a smaller second angle e.g. 30 degrees with respect to the horizon. The stage also shows that a user has provided input to adjust the perspective of the view of the 3D map by touching two fingers on the screen and dragging the two fingers in an upward direction e.g. a swipe gesture . The scene rising is accomplished by the virtual camera lowering and decreasing the viewing angle with respect to the horizon. Rendering a 3D map view using the virtual camera positioned at this angle results in a 3D map view in which the buildings and the roads are taller than their illustration in the first map view . As indicated by the dashed line version of the virtual camera the virtual camera moved farther downwards along arc while tilting e.g. pitching farther up.

The third stage shows the virtual camera at a different third perspective position pointing at a higher perspective towards a location e.g. the virtual camera s point of focus on the 3D map at a larger third angle e.g. 80 with respect to the horizon. The stage also shows that the user has provided input to adjust the perspective of the view of the 3D map by touching two fingers on the screen and dragging the two fingers in a downward direction e.g. a swipe gesture . The scene dropping or flattening out is accomplished by the virtual camera rising and increasing its angle with respect to the horizon. As shown at this stage in some embodiments the mapping application flattens the buildings e.g. reduces the z axis component of the polygons to the ground level in the 3D map when the virtual camera is positioned in a top down or near top down position so that 3D map views rendered using the virtual camera appear 2D. Rendering a 3D map view using the virtual camera positioned at the angle in the third stage results in a 3D map view in which the buildings appear smaller flatter and the roads appear smaller than their illustration in the second map view . As shown by the dashed line version of the virtual camera the virtual camera moved farther upwards along arc while tilting e.g. pitching farther down.

In some embodiments the virtual camera can be made to move in this manner when the mapping application receives input for adjusting the perspective for viewing the 3D map . In some of these embodiments the mapping application switches to a top down mode where the rendering position faces straight down that produces 2D map views when the zoom level reaches a particular zoom out level.

While moving along an arc the virtual camera rotates to maintain a desired location on the map at the focal point of the camera. The desired location in some cases is a stationary location of the device or a stationary location that the user is browsing on the map. In other cases the desired location is a moving location in front of the moving location of the device as the user is moving with the device.

In addition to the 3D control the mapping application of some embodiments allows a user to transition a map view from a two dimensional 2D presentation to a 3D presentation through gestural inputs of the multi touch interface of the device. For instance through a two finger gestural input the user can be made to experience pushing down a 2D map view into a 3D map view or pulling up a 3D map view into a 2D map view. This can also be thought of as pulling down a virtual camera from a 2D directly from above view into a 3D side angle view through the two finger gesture.

Different embodiment use different two finger gestural operations to push down a 2D map view into a 3D map view or pull up a 3D map view into a 2D map view. illustrates one example of two finger gestures for pushing down a 2D map into a 3D map. This figure presents this example in terms of four stages of operation of the UI of the mapping application. The first stage shows the application UI presenting a 2D map view about a current location of the device.

The second stage then shows the start of a two finger gesture operation to push down the 2D view until a 3D view is presented. In some embodiments the application identifies a push down of the 2D map when it detects that two contacts are placed horizontally or approximately horizontally on a 2D map and move upwards together. Some embodiments require the movement to exceed a certain amount in order to impose an inertia that acts against the pushing of a 2D map into a 3D map and thereby prevent such a transition to occur accidentally.

Other embodiments use other schemes to transition from a 2D map to a 3D map through a gestural input. For instance the application of some embodiments performs such a transition when a user places two fingers vertically with respect to each other and exerts a greater force on the top finger so as to trigger one of the sensors of the device e.g. gyroscope etc. or to trigger a rotation of the fingers. Yet other embodiments require an opposite operation to be performed to transition from the 2D map view to a 3D map view. For instance some embodiments require the two horizontally aligned fingers to move downwards on the 2D map in unison in order to push down the 2D view into a 3D view.

The third stage shows the two fingers of the user after they have moved up by a certain amount across the device s screen. It also shows that the 2D map has been replaced with a 3D map . The fourth stage shows the 3D map at the end of the two finger gesture movement. The 3D control appears highlighted in this stage to indicate that the current map view is a 3D map view.

In some embodiments a 3D map view can be pulled up into a 2D map view by performing the opposite two finger operation. Specifically in these embodiments the mapping application transitions between a 3D map and a 2D map when it detects two horizontal or approximately horizontal contacts on a 3D map that move downwards in unison by an amount greater than a threshold amount.

When transitioning from a 2D map view to a 3D map view some embodiments provide an animation that shows object that appear as flat in the 2D map view as rising and becoming larger in the 3D map view. Generating such animation that shows object rising falling and becoming larger smaller is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 027 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014 0071119 entitled Displaying 3D Objects in a 3D Map Presentation concurrently filed with this application. This concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 027 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014 0071119 is incorporated herein by reference. illustrates this animation in three stages. The first stage shows a user selecting the 3D control when viewing a 2D map view. The second and third stages and show subsequent views though not necessarily successive views that the mapping application provides after it starts to provide a 3D map view. As the zoom in level increases between the second and third stages the height of the buildings in the map views increases to provide an animation that conveys that the view is moving into the 3D scene from the 2D view.

When transitioning from the 3D view to the 2D view the mapping application of some embodiments provides an opposite animation that shows the objects in the scene shrinking until they collapse into flat objects in a 2D map.

In some embodiments the mapping application provides a transition from 2D to 3D or from 3D to 2D while the mapping application operates in the navigation mode or in the route inspection mode. These two operational modes of the mapping application are described further below.

The second stage shows that the mapping application is displaying the map at a higher zoom level than it did at the previous stage . However the 3D control is maintaining the first appearance because the 3D map data is still not available even at this particular higher zoom level. The second stage also shows that the mapping application is receiving another gestural input to zoom in the map further.

The third stage shows that the mapping application is displaying the map at a higher zoom level than it did at the previous stage . The mapping application has changed the appearance of the 3D control into a second appearance e.g. 3D in black letters to indicate that the 3D map data is available at this zoom level. When the mapping application receives a selection of the 3D control the mapping application of some embodiments would change the appearance of the 3D control to a third appearance e.g. 3D in blue letters and display the map in 3D e.g. by changing into a perspective view from a straight down view for 2D . The third appearance therefore would indicate that the map is displayed in 3D. The third stage shows that the mapping application is receiving yet another gestural input to zoom in the map even further to a higher zoom level. The third stage shows that the mapping application of some embodiments is displaying buildings in the map as grey boxes.

The fourth stage shows that the mapping application is displaying the map at a higher zoom level than it did at the previous stage . The mapping application has changed the appearance of the 3D control into a fourth appearance e.g. a building icon in a first color as shown in order to indicate that 3D immersive map data for rendering immersive 3D map view are available at this zoom level. The fourth stage also shows that the mapping application is receiving a selection of the 3D control .

The fifth and sixth stages and show subsequent views though not necessarily successive views that the mapping application provides after it starts to provide a 3D immersive map view. The zoom level does not change between the fifth and sixth stages in some embodiments but the height of the buildings in the map views increases to provide an animation that conveys that the view is moving into the 3D immersive map view from the 2D view. Also from the stage to the mapping application has changed the appearance of the 3D control into the fifth appearance e.g. a building icon in a second color as shown in order to indicate that the map is displayed in the 3D immersive view.

The mapping application allows a user to explore about a location that is shown in the map through a variety of mechanisms in some embodiments. For instance as mentioned above the mapping application of some embodiments allows a user to browse about a location by performing one or more swipe operations e.g. by dragging a finger across the touch sensitive screen of the device. Such operations move the view presented by the application to new locations on the map. One example of the swipe operation in 3D map view was described above by reference to .

Through gestural inputs the mapping application also allows a user to rotate a 2D or 3D map in some embodiments. The mapping application in some embodiments is a vector mapping application that allows for direct manipulations such as rotation and 2D 3D manipulations of the map while browsing it. However some of the effects to the map can be disorienting. Without an easy way to get back to north up orientation i.e. an orientation where the north direction is aligned with the top of the device some users may have difficulty interacting with the map views. To solve this the mapping application of some embodiments provides the floating compass control on the map. As mentioned this compass serves both as an indicator that points to north and as a button to restore a north up orientation. To further minimize clutter on the map the mapping application only shows this button when the map is rotated.

The second stage also shows that in response to the rotation of the map the application has presented the compass on the map to indicate the north direction on the rotated map. The third stage then shows the user s selection of the compass . The fourth stage then shows that after the selection of the compass the application rotates the map back to the map view i.e. north up orientation .

The second stage also shows that in response to the rotation of the map the application has presented the compass on the map to indicate the north direction on the rotated map. The third stage then shows further rotation of the map in response to user s another two finger gesture. The compass still indicates the north direction but has rotated along with the rotated map. The fourth stage then shows even further rotation of the map and the compass .

In some embodiments the mapping application does not allow the user to rotate a 2D or 3D map at some zoom levels. For instance when the map is zoomed out to a low zoom level the mapping application does not rotate the map upon receiving the user s gestural input e.g. two figure rotation operation to rotate the map. In some embodiments a module of the mapping application that is responsible for the virtual camera movement checks the current zoom level and decides to ignore such instructions if the map should not be rotated at the current zoom level.

In some other embodiments the application rotates the map a particular distance when the user provides the gestural input for rotating the map but rotates the map back to a default orientation e.g. North when the user releases or stops the gestural input.

In some embodiments the mapping application provides an inertia effect for rotation of a map. When a user provides a particular type of gestural input e.g. input that terminates at an angular or translational velocity greater than a threshold velocity to rotate the map the mapping application generates an inertia effect that causes the map to continue rotating and decelerate to a stop. The inertia effect in some embodiments provides the user with a more realistic interaction with the map that mimics behaviors in the real world.

As shown the 2D map view includes several streets running in a parallel or perpendicular directions. The first stage also shows that a user is providing input to rotate the 2D map view . Specifically the user is performing a gesture to rotate the 2D map view by touching two fingers at two locations on the touchscreen and rotating the two fingers in a clockwise direction as indicated by the two arrows depicted in the figure. In this example the highlighting of the fingertips are illustrated for purposes of explanation. In some embodiments the mapping application does not actually display the highlighting around the fingertips.

The second stage shows the 2D map immediately after the user has completed the input to rotate the 2D map. For this example the user completed the input by lifting the two fingers off the touchscreen of the device as indicated by the highlighting around the fingertips no longer shown. In addition the second stage shows a 2D map view of the 2D map rendered by the mapping application. As shown the mapping application has rotated the 2D map in a clockwise direction from the 2D map view to the 2D map view . The streets shown in the first stage have rotated approximately 45 degrees in clockwise direction.

The mapping application of different embodiments utilizes different methods to implement an inertia effect for a rotation operation. For instance in some embodiments the mapping application determines an angular or translational velocity of the user s input at or near the instance at which the user stops the movement of the fingers or lifts the fingers from the touchscreen based on one of the fingers or an average of both of the fingers. When the user repeats stopping the figures without lifting and starting to move the fingers again the mapping application of some embodiments treats each stop as an end of an input while in other embodiments the mapping application treats it as one input until the user lifts the fingers from the screen.

The mapping application uses the angular velocity to determine an angle amount e.g. degrees for the inertia effect and determines the manner at which the virtual camera used to view the 2D map decelerates e.g. constant exponential logarithmic etc. the angular velocity to rotate the determined angle amount. In some embodiments the mapping application renders and displays an animation of the inertia effect e.g. a decelerating rotation of the 2D map from the 2D map view that rotates the 2D map the determined angle amount .

In some embodiments the mapping application does not itself analyze the user s gestural inputs. For instance the mapping application of these embodiments does not determine the angular velocity of the user s input. Instead the mapping application of these embodiments receives the angular velocity determined by the operating system of the device on which the mapping application runs. The operating system of the device has an interface to receive the user s gestural inputs. The operating system analyzes the received inputs and provides the analysis to the mapping application. The mapping application will determine the inertia effect to apply based on the analysis of the inputs.

The third stage illustrates the 2D map after the mapping application has rendered and displayed the animation of the inertia effect. As shown a 2D map view of the 3D map rendered by the mapping application is displayed. In the third stage the mapping application has rotated the 2D map farther clockwise after the user completed the input in the second stage . As shown the 2D map view in the third stage shows the streets rotated farther clockwise from the streets shown in the 3D map view .

In some embodiments the mapping application also provides the inertia effect for operations other than rotating the map such as panning the map or entering or exiting 3D operations e.g. panning rotate entering from 2D to 3D . Inertia effect for these other operations are further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702 entitled Rendering Maps concurrently filed with this application. This concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702 is incorporated herein by reference. conceptually illustrates a process of some embodiments for rotating a map view based on gesture input. In some embodiments the mapping application performs the process when the mapping application is in a map viewing mode e.g. a location browsing mode a navigation mode a 2D viewing mode a 3D viewing mode etc. and the mapping application receives a gesture through a touchscreen of a device on which the mapping application is executing.

The process starts by receiving at a gesture for rotating the map view. In some embodiments a gesture for rotating the map view includes a multi touch gesture received through a touchscreen e.g. simultaneously touching the touchscreen with multiple fingers . In this example the process receives a two touch rotate gesture.

Next the process identifies at a rotation component of the received gesture. The process of some embodiments identifies the rotation component of the gesture by identifying an amount of rotation of the gesture s touch points. For instance in some such embodiments the process identifies the amount of rotation of the gesture s touch points by 1 determining a first vector from the initial location of one touch point to the initial location of the other touch point 2 determining a second vector from a second location of the one touch point to a second location of the other touch point and 3 determining a rotation direction based on the initial locations of the touch points and the second locations of the touch points.

The process then determines at whether the amount of rotation is within a threshold amount. When the process determines that the amount of rotation is not within the threshold amount the process ends. Otherwise the process determines at an axis of rotation based on the gesture. In some embodiments the process determines the axis of rotation by 1 identifying a point along a vector from the initial location of one touch point to the initial location of the other touch point and 2 determining a point on map view that corresponds to the point along the vector e.g. the point on the map that coincides with the point along the vector . The process uses the determined point on the map view as the location of an axis e.g. a z axis about which the map view is rotated.

Next the process adjusts at the map view based on the axis of rotation and the amount of rotation. In some embodiments the process adjusts the map view by rotating the map view about the determined axis of rotation by the determined amount of rotation in the determined rotation direction. Different embodiments use different coordinate spaces for a map. For example the map of some embodiments uses a Mercator unit coordinate space. In such embodiments the process adjusts the virtual camera s position with respect to the map in order to adjust the map view. As another example in some embodiments the map uses a World Geodetic System e.g. WGS 84 as the map s coordinate space. The process in some such embodiments adjusts the map with respect to the virtual camera s position in order to adjust the map view.

Finally the process renders at the adjusted map view for display on the device. In some embodiments the rendered map view is an image that represents the adjusted map view. Then the process ends.

In some embodiments the 3D map is rotatable at a defined range and or set of zoom levels. For example in some embodiments the mapping application allows the 3D map to be rotated at a defined number of the highest zoom levels e.g. zoom levels and prevents the 3D map from being rotated at the remaining lower zoom levels e.g. zoom levels . In some such embodiments the mapping application does not generate instructions to rotate the 3D map when the mapping application receives input to rotate the 3D map at a zoom level that is defined to not allow rotation operations. In other such embodiments the mapping application generates instructions to rotate the 3D map when the mapping application receives input to rotate the 3D map at a zoom level that is defined not to allow rotation operations but the mapping application simply ignores the instructions. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the zoom levels at which rotation operations are allowed to be performed on a 3D map might be defined in any number of different ways in different embodiments.

The mapping application of some embodiments uses novel techniques to adjust or leave unadjusted the text and or symbols that appear in the map view as the map view rotates. illustrates one example of this novel approach in terms of four stages to of UI operations. In this example the name Apple Inc. appears at a location which is 1 Infinite Loop Cupertino Calif.

In the first stage the name Apple Inc. is upright in a particular map view. In the second and third stages and the map view rotates in response to a user s two finger rotation operation. In both of these stages the name Apple Inc. is shown to slightly rotate at a much smaller angle than the rotation angle of the map. The behavior of the name Apple Inc. is as if this name is pinned at its center or top to the map but its center of gravity points downwards. Hence whenever the map rotates the name slightly rotates as well but its center of gravity makes it rotate less and eventually brings back the name to its upright position. This upright position of the name Apple Inc. is shown in the fourth stage . This stage shows the map view after the rotation operation has completed.

Maintaining the constant upright position of all the text and or symbols in the a rotating map however might be a little bit distracting when the map has many text characters or symbols and many of them are fighting against the rotation to remain straight up. Accordingly for some of the characters and or symbols the mapping application of some embodiments employs an alternative mechanism to adjust their orientation during a rotation.

In the first stage the street names are aligned with the upward and rightward direction of travel on the streets. In the second and third stages and the map view rotates in response to a user s two finger rotation operation. In both of these stages none of the street names have rotated since the map has not been rotated by the necessary threshold amount. However by the time the map is rotated to reach its orientation in the fourth stage the map has been rotated enough to pass a threshold amount which would require some of the street names streets to have to be rotated to maintain their alignment with the upward travel direction.

Alternatively or in conjunction with the perspective adjustment feature described above by reference to the mapping application of some embodiments allows the user to zoom in and out of a view of a 3D map e.g. by providing gesture input with two fingers . illustrates a zoom adjustment feature provided by the mapping application of some embodiments. In particular illustrates a virtual camera at three different stages that show the movement of the virtual camera in response to zooming adjustments. As shown shows a location in a 3D map contains two buildings and two roads forming a T junction.

The first stage shows a 3D map with a virtual camera at a particular position pointing towards the 3D map . In this position the camera is pointing to a location that may be a stationary position of the device or of a location being explored or a moving position in front of a moving location of the device in a case where the map is used for navigation. Rendering a 3D map view based on the virtual camera s position results in the 3D map view .

The second stage shows the virtual camera at a different zoom level position pointing towards the 3D map . The stage shows that a user has provided input to increase the zoom level of the view of the 3D map by touching two fingers near each other on the screen of the device and moving the fingertips apart while the fingers are touching the screen e.g. a spread gesture .

The zoom in adjustment is accomplished by the virtual camera moving closer to the 3D map along a line . In some embodiments the line that the mapping application uses to move the virtual camera along is a line formed by the front of the virtual camera and the virtual camera s point of focus. The mapping application of some embodiments moves the virtual camera along a line formed by the front of the virtual camera and a location in the 3D map based on the user s input to zoom into the view of the 3D map .

Rendering a 3D map view using the virtual camera at this position results in a 3D map view in which the buildings and the roads appear closer than the position shown in the 3D map view . As indicated by the dashed line version of the virtual camera the virtual camera moved closer towards the 3D map along the line .

The third stage shows the virtual camera at a different zoom level position pointing towards the 3D map . In this stage the user has provided input to decrease the zoom level of the 3D map by touching two fingers far apart on the screen of the device and moving the fingertips closer together while the fingers are touching the screen e.g. a pinch gesture .

The zoom out adjustment is accomplished by moving the virtual camera moving farther away from the 3D map along a line . In some embodiments the line that the mapping application uses to move the virtual camera along is a line formed by the front of the virtual camera and the virtual camera s point of focus. The mapping application of some embodiments moves the virtual camera along a line formed by the front of the virtual camera and a location in the 3D map based on the user s input to zoom into the view of the 3D map .

Rendering a 3D map view using the virtual camera at this position results in a 3D map view in which the buildings and the roads appear farther than the position illustrated in the 3D map view . As shown by the dashed line version of the virtual camera the virtual camera moved farther from the 3D map along the line .

As described above illustrates several example zoom adjustment operations and the corresponding movement of a virtual camera in a 3D map that is used to render 3D map views of the 3D map. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that any number of different zoom adjustments are possible. Additionally the mapping application of some embodiments performs zoom adjustment operations in response to additional and or different types of input e.g. tapping the screen double tap the screen etc. .

The first stage shows the virtual camera at a particular position along the arc . As shown the arc represents a defined range e.g. angular range within which the virtual camera is movable. The first stage also shows three positions along the arc e.g. perspective view angles . In this example the mapping application moves the virtual camera along the arc between the high perspective end of the arc e.g. the position along the arc when the virtual camera is most tilted downwards and the position in a manner similar to that described above by reference to . Rendering a 3D map view of based on the virtual camera s position in the first stage results in 3D map view .

When the virtual camera passes the position while moving towards the low perspective end of the arc the mapping application reduces the speed e.g. decelerates at which the virtual camera moves towards the low perspective end of the arc regardless of the input provided by a user. In some embodiments the mapping application reduces the speed of the virtual camera at a constant rate while in some embodiments the mapping application reduces the speed of the virtual camera at an exponential rate. Additional and or different methods for decreasing the speed of the virtual camera are used in some embodiments.

The second stage shows that the virtual camera has moved to a position along the arc at or near the low perspective end of the arc . As shown a user is providing input to adjust the perspective of the view of the 3D map by touching two fingers on the screen and dragging the two fingers in an upward direction e.g. a swipe gesture . In response to the input the mapping application moved the virtual camera toward the low perspective end of the arc while tilting the virtual camera upwards. When the virtual camera reaches the position along the arc the mapping application prevents the virtual camera from moving lower beyond the position while the user continues to provide input to decrease the perspective of the view of the 3D map e.g. the user continues to drag the two fingers upwards on the touchscreen .

In some embodiments when the user stops to provide input to decrease the perspective of the view of the 3D map e.g. the user lifts the two fingers off the touchscreen the mapping application bounces or snaps the position of the virtual camera from the position up to the position along the arc . As the mapping application is generating or rendering 3D map views of the 3D map based on the view of the virtual camera during the bounce or snap motion the generated 3D map views provide a bounce animation that displays the 3D map view briefly bouncing or snapping down in order to indicate to the user that the perspective of the map view cannot be decreased any farther. Rendering a 3D map view using the virtual camera positioned at this angle results in a 3D map view in which the buildings and the roads are taller compared to the map view .

The third stage shows the virtual camera after the mapping application bounced or snapped the position of the virtual camera to the position in response to the user ceasing to provide input. Different embodiments use different techniques for implementing the bounce or snap of the virtual camera . For instance the mapping application of some embodiments starts quickly accelerating the virtual camera along the arc for a defined distance or until the virtual camera reaches a defined speed. Then the mapping application decelerates the virtual camera for the remaining distance to the position along the arc . Other ways to implement the bounce or snap effect are used in some embodiments. Rendering a 3D map view using the virtual camera positioned at the position along the arc in the third stage results in a 3D map view in which the buildings appear a little smaller and flatter and the roads appear a little smaller compared to the map view .

As described above illustrates a technique for preventing a virtual camera from moving beyond the low perspective end of an arc. Alternatively or in conjunction with preventing the virtual camera from moving beyond the low perspective end of the arc the mapping application of some embodiments utilizes a similar technique for preventing the virtual camera from moving beyond the high perspective end of the arc. In addition shows an example of a position along an arc at which to slow down a virtual camera a position along the arc to prevent the virtual camera from moving past and a position along the arc to which the virtual camera snaps or bounces back. Different embodiments define the positions any number of different ways. For instance in some embodiments the position along the arc at which to slow down the virtual camera is the same or near the position along the arc to which the virtual camera snaps or bounces back.

The tile retrievers perform various processes to retrieve map tiles in some embodiments according to requests for the map tiles from the mesh builders . The mesh builders as are described below identify existing map tiles that are stored on a mapping service server or in a cache on the device performing the processing pipeline needed to build their respective meshes. The tile retrievers receive the requests for the map tiles determine the best location from which to retrieve the map tiles e.g. from the mapping service from a cache on the device etc. and decompress the map tiles if required.

The mesh builders also referred to as tile sources of some embodiments are instantiated by the tile provider in order to build different layers of view tiles. Depending on the type of map being displayed by the mapping application the tile provider may instantiate a different number and different types of mesh builders . For instance for a flyover or satellite view map the tile provider might only instantiate one mesh builder as the flyover map tiles of some embodiments do not contain multiple layers of data. In fact in some embodiments the flyover map tiles contain an already built mesh generated at the mapping service for which the flyover images taken by a satellite airplane helicopter etc. are used as textures. However in some embodiments additional mesh builders may be instantiated for generating the labels to overlay on the flyover images when the application is in a hybrid mode. For a 2D or 3D rendered vector map i.e. a non satellite image map some embodiments instantiate separate mesh builders to build meshes for landcover polygon data e.g. parks bodies of water etc. roads place of interest marks point labels e.g. labels for parks etc. road labels traffic if displaying traffic buildings raster data for certain objects at certain zoom levels as well as other layers of data to incorporate into the map. Generating flyover view map is described in detail in PCT Application PCT EP2011 054155 published as PCT Publication No. WO 2012 126500 entitled 3D Streets. PCT Application PCT EP2011 054155 published as PCT Publication No. WO 2012 126500 is incorporated herein by reference.

The mesh builders of some embodiments receive empty view tiles from the tile provider and return built view tiles to the tile provider . That is the tile provider sends to each of the mesh builders one or more view tiles not shown . Each of the view tiles indicates an area of the world for which to draw a mesh. Upon receiving such a view tile a mesh builder identifies the map tiles needed from the mapping service and sends its list to the tile retrievers .

Upon receiving the tiles back from the tile retrievers the mesh builder uses vector data stored in the tiles to build a polygon mesh for the area described by the view tile. In some embodiments the mesh builder uses several different mesh building processors to build the mesh. These functions may include a mesh generator a triangulator a shadow generator and or a texture decoder. In some embodiments these functions and additional mesh building functions are available to each mesh builder with different mesh builders using different functions. After building its mesh each mesh builder returns its view tiles to the tile provider with its layer of the mesh filled in.

The tile provider receives from the controller a particular view i.e. a volume or viewing frustrum that represents the map view to be displayed i.e. the volume visible from the virtual camera . The tile provider performs any culling e.g. identifying the surface area to be displayed in the view tile then sends these view tiles to the mesh builders .

The tile provider then receives the built view tiles from the mesh builders and in some embodiments performs culling on the built mesh using the particular view from the virtual camera e.g. removing surface area too far away removing objects that will be entirely behind other objects etc. . In some embodiments the tile provider receives the built view tiles from the different mesh builders at different times e.g. due to different processing times to complete more and less complicated meshes different time elapsed before receiving the necessary map tiles from the tile retrievers etc. . Once all of the layers of view tiles have been returned the tile provider of some embodiments puts the layers together and releases the data to the controller for rendering.

The virtual camera generates a volume or surface for the pipeline to render and sends this information to the controller . Based on a particular location and orientation from which the map will be rendered i.e. the point in 3D space from which the user views the map the virtual camera identifies a field of view to actually send to the tile provider . In some embodiments when the mapping application is rendering the 3D perspective view for navigation the field of view of the virtual camera is determined according to an algorithm that generates a new virtual camera location and orientation at regular intervals based on the movement of the user device.

The controller is responsible for managing the tile provider virtual camera and map rendering engine in some embodiments. In some embodiments multiple tile providers may actually be instantiated and the controller puts together several view tiles e.g. map tiles and building tiles to create a scene that is handed off to the map rendering engine .

The map rendering engine is responsible for generating a drawing to output to a display device based on the mesh tiles not shown sent from the virtual camera. The map rendering engine of some embodiments has several sub processes. In some embodiments each different type of map element is rendered by a different sub process with the rendering engine handling the occlusion of different layers of objects e.g. placing labels above or behind different buildings generating roads on top of land cover etc. . Examples of such rendering processes include a road rendering process a building rendering process and a label rendering process a vegetation rendering process a raster traffic rendering process a raster road rendering process a satellite rendering process a polygon rendering process a background raster rendering process etc.

The operation of the rendering pipeline in some embodiments will now be described. Based on user input to view a particular map region at a particular zoom level the virtual camera specifies a location and orientation from which to view the map region and sends this viewing frustrum or volume to the controller . The controller instantiates one or more tile providers. While one tile provider is shown in this figure some embodiments allow the instantiation of multiple tile providers at once. For instance some embodiments instantiate separate tile providers for building tiles and for map tiles.

The tile provider performs any culling necessary to generate an empty view tile identifying regions of the map region for which a mesh needs to be built and sends the empty view tile to the mesh builders which are instantiated for the different layers of the drawn map e.g. roads land cover POI labels etc. . The mesh builders use a manifest received from the mapping service that identifies the different tiles available on the mapping service server i.e. as nodes of a quadtree . The mesh builders request specific map tiles from the tile retrievers which return the requested map tiles to the mesh builders .

Once a particular mesh builder has received its map tiles it begins using the vector data stored in the map tiles to build the mesh for the view tiles sent from the tile provider . After building the mesh for its map layer the mesh builder sends the built view tile back to the tile provider . The tile provider waits until it has received all of the view tiles from the various mesh builders then layers these together and sends the completed view tile to the controller . The controller stitches together the returned tiles from all of its tile providers e.g. a map view tile and a building view tile and sends this scene to the rendering engine . The map rendering engine uses the information in the map tiles to draw the scene for display.

The search field of the mapping application in some embodiments is another UI tool that the application employs to make the transition between the different modalities seamless. In some embodiments a user can initiate a search by tapping in the search field. This directs the application to present an animation that 1 presents an on screen keyboard and 2 opens a search table full of invaluable completions. This table has some important subtleties. When the search field is tapped and before the terms are edited or when the search field is empty the table contains a list of recents which in some embodiments are recent searches and route directions that the user has requested. This makes it very easy to quickly bring up recently accessed results.

After any edit in the search field the table is filled with search completions both from local sources e.g. bookmarks contacts recent searches recent route directions etc. and remote server suggestions. The incorporation of the user s contact card into the search interface adds additional flexibility to the design. When showing recents a route from current location to the user s home is always offered in some embodiments while it is offered in the contexts that are deemed to be appropriate in other embodiments. Also when the search term matches at least part of an address label e.g. Wo for Work the application presents the user s labeled address as a completion in the search table in some embodiments. Together these behaviors make the search UI a very powerful way to get results onto a map from a variety of sources. In addition to allowing a user to initiate a search the presence of the search field in the primary map view in some embodiments also allows users to see the query corresponding to search results on the map and to remove those search results by clearing the query.

As described above when the search field is initially tapped and before any search terms are provided or edited or when the search field is empty the search table displays a list of recent searched terms and searched route directions. illustrates four stages of a user s interaction with the application running on a user s device in order to display the search table with a list of the user s recent searches and recent route directions.

The first stage shows the device after the mapping application has opened. As mentioned above the mapping application s UI has a starting page that in some embodiments 1 displays a map of the current location of the device and 2 several UI controls arranged in the top bar and as floating controls. In the first stage the user taps the search field which is currently empty. The top bar includes the direction control and the bookmark control .

The second stage illustrates the application displaying a search table after receiving the user s tapping of the search field. This search table is displayed regardless of whether or not the user provides any search terms in the search field. The search table provides a list of suggested search completions including recently searched terms and route directions. In particular the search table indicates that the user recently searched for John Smith and Pizzeria. Each of the search completions listed in the search table also indicates certain other useful information. For instance an icon displayed next to John Smith indicates that this person is included in a contact list on the user s device and Pizzeria is currently saved as a bookmark as indicated by a bookmark icon .

The search table also lists the user s recent route directions which includes directions to Royal Burgers illustrated at the bottom of the search table . Also the search table lists an option to obtain directions from the user s current location to their home address which is illustrated as the first item of the search table . When showing recents a route from current location to the user s home is always offered in some embodiments. Moreover the mapping application of some embodiments displays recent route directions only when the search field is empty. That is once the user starts typing in a search query the mapping application does not include recent route directions in the list of suggested search completions.

The second stage also illustrates that the mapping application of some embodiments removes the direction control and the bookmark control from the top bar . The mapping application inserts a cancel control for canceling out of the search table and going back to the map view shown in the previous stage .

The third stage illustrates the user s selection of the directions to Home option listed as the first item in the search table. By providing some of the most frequently requested user searches and direction requests at the top of the search table including a direction to home option the application provides a user the ability to quickly obtain information for their most common requests without having to extensively navigate the application to receive these results.

The fourth stage illustrates the mapping application displaying a route corresponding to directions from the user s current location to their home. The mapping application of some embodiments also removes the search field and the cancel control from the top bar and places the clear control and a start control . The start control in some embodiments is for starting the navigation according to the selected route. In some embodiments the mapping application centers the current location indicator in the display area so that the route from the current location is displayed from the center of the display area.

A user may also provide a search query in the search field. When the user enters a full search term in the search field the mapping application of some embodiments provides a list of items that match or include the search term that has been typed in the search field so far. For each particular search the user has the option to select from the list of items displayed in the search table or the user may select a search button on the keyboard to execute a full search of the search term as it relates to the map and the user s current location.

The next stage shows the device after the user has typed in a search term Pavilion. A search table illustrates a list of search completions for the user entered query term Pavilion. The listed search completions include suggested searches for Pavilion Market Pavilion Theaters and directions to Bowling Pavilion from the user s current location. However the search completions for routes do not show the text Current Location in some embodiments. Instead the mapping application displays the address of the destinations as shown. This is because the mapping application of some embodiments assumes that the user s typing in the letters indicates that the user intends to get to the destinations that match the search query and therefore the destination address is more useful to the user information than the indication that the route is from the current location to the destination.

Moreover the list of suggested search completions in the search table does not display any bookmarks or contacts since there are no matching items stored locally on the user s device that match with Pavilion in this example. Furthermore because the user has not executed any recent searches or directions for Pavilion all of the suggested search completions listed in the search table have been obtained from the remote servers in some embodiments. Obtaining data from remote servers is described further below.

Furthermore the listed search completions may include search completions that match local geographies e.g. streets neighborhoods cites states or country . For instance Pavilion Street or City of Pavilion may appear in the search completions list when there are such street or city exist. Also as the user enters parts of an address e.g. 220 Pavilion the remote servers may retrieve the most significant completion for this address if such address exists e.g. 220 Promenade Drive Skycity Calif. .

The third stage illustrates the user disregarding any of the suggested search completions listed in the search table and instead selecting the search button on the keyboard. The fourth stage illustrates a map with a pin for Pavilion Theaters. In some embodiments the mapping application adjusts the zooming level of the map as is described further below. The mapping application in some of these embodiments does not display a pin for a location when the location falls out of the map at the current zooming level. As such a pin for Bowling Pavilion is not shown in the map. The mapping application has also removed the cancel control from the top bar and restored the direction control and the bookmark control in the top bar .

After any edit in the search field the mapping application of some embodiments instantly fills the search table with automatic search completions. That is as the user types in a search term in the search field the mapping application provides a list of suggested search completions based on the characters that have been typed in at a particular instance in time. The mapping application of some embodiments obtains these suggested search completions from local sources e.g. bookmarks contacts recent searches recent route directions etc. and also from remote servers.

The search table will continue to adjust and refine the list of suggested search completions in the search table as it receives more user input i.e. more alphanumeric characters and symbols and query terms in the search field. In some embodiments the mapping application adjusts and refines the list as the user provides more input even if the user is misspelling the term being entered. For instance when the user types in Piza the mapping application will show search completions that contains the correctly spelled word Pizza. The mapping application of some embodiments uses a spell checking and correction mechanism as well as other data e.g. search history etc. to find similarly spelled words to make the suggested list of search completions.

Each search completion may be derived from a variety of sources both local on the user s device and derived from remote sources and servers. The mapping application of some embodiments lists the search completions from local sources ahead of the search completions from remote sources and servers. For instance the search table illustrated in the second stage lists several search completions including Paul Pizza directions to Police Station and directions to Promenade in that order from the top to the bottom of the list. Paul is derived from a contact card on the user s device Pizza is derived from a previous user search stored in a search history file on the user s device and directions to Police Station is derived from a recently searched route directions. As mentioned above the search completions for routes do not show the text Current Location in some embodiments. Instead the mapping application of some of these embodiments displays the address of the destinations. In some cases the mapping application does not indicate the route is from the current location nor it displays the address of the destination. For instance the directions to Police Station do not additionally show the address because the search completion itself includes the address of the police station.

However Promenade is a search completion obtained from a remote server. A remote map server would suggest this completion based on the search queries that other users of the map server have used from the current location of the device. Hence Promenade is listed at the bottom of the search table after the three suggested completions that the mapping application obtained locally. As is described further below the mapping application of some embodiments orders locally obtained search completions.

In some embodiments the mapping application s suggested completions and search results are based on the current location of the device. That is the suggested completions and search results that fall within the region of the map that is within a range from the device s current location. Alternatively or conjunctively the region of the map that is currently displayed in the display area is what the mapping application of some embodiments bases its suggestion and search results. In these embodiments the mapping application favors the search completions and search results that fall within the currently displayed region of the map.

Moreover the mapping application considers other factors when defining and adjusting the list of suggested search completions. In some embodiments the mapping application considers the temporal factors. For instance the mapping application breaks up the search history i.e. the list of previously used search completions into different periods of a day e.g. late night early morning etc. week month and or year and favors the search completions and search results of a particular set of periods in which the time the current search being conducted falls.

The third stage illustrates the user selecting Pizza from the list of search completions displayed in the search table. The fourth stage illustrates the mapping application now displays a map with the location of Pizza Place illustrated as a banner and a pin on the map. The user may then select various icons displayed on the banner to perform a variety of functions including obtaining reviews for the restaurant invoking navigation to the restaurant or receiving directions to the restaurant and various other features as are described further below.

The banner includes a route fetch control depicted as an icon showing a car for fetching a route e.g. a driving route from the current location to that pin without ever leaving the map view. The route fetch control is also for initiating navigation experience. For instance the mapping application of some embodiments will provide one or more routes to the location of the pin from the current location of the device upon receiving a selection of the route fetch control. When a route is selected the mapping application can start operating in a navigation mode or in a route inspection mode.

The second stage also illustrates the user selecting Pizza from the list of search completions displayed in the search table. The third stage illustrates the mapping application now displays a map with the location of Pizza PLC1 and the location of Pizza

PLC2 banner not shown illustrated as associated pins and respectively on the map. The user may then select various icons displayed on the banner to perform a variety of functions including obtaining reviews for the restaurant invoking navigation to the restaurant or receiving directions to the restaurant and various other features as are described further below.

In order to provide certain search completions within the search table the mapping application of some embodiments analyzes a variety of local information stored in the user s device. For instance each user s device may contain a contacts list containing several contact cards. Each contact card may contain a variety of information and labels for each contact. For instance each contact card may contain contact labels with information if applicable regarding the contact s first and last name company name home address work address mobile phone number work phone number e mail address URL and various other information.

Likewise the contact list may contain a specific contact card corresponding to the particular user of the mapping application which the mapping application may specify as a ME card. The mapping application may frequently access the user s ME card to utilize certain information required for certain application features including the feature of obtaining directions from a user s current location to their home address or work address which are provided in numerous different contexts within the mapping application. In particular the mapping application of some embodiments lists search completions that the mapping application obtains from the ME card on the top of search table.

During the second stage the user has entered a partial number 12 that may match at least part to an address or a search term. In some embodiments the application first matches the user entered search query with information contained in the user s ME card and in the user s contact list stored on their device. If the application detects any matching contact labels between the search query and the user s ME card the application of some embodiments will display the information found in the identified contact as a suggested search completion listed at the top of the search table. In some embodiments the mapping application displays the information found in the identified contact as a suggested search completion only if the matching information is address of the contact. Underneath this suggested search completion the mapping application displays text e.g. Current Location to indicate the route is from the current location to home. However as mentioned above the mapping application of some embodiments instead displays the destination address instead of or in conjunction with displaying this text or does not display the text nor the destination address. The application will display other matching contact cards below the search completion originated from the ME card. In some embodiments the mapping application may also present search completions not related to the ME cards. For instance when the user enters a 12 the mapping application will present matching search completions from local previous search completions including social networking sites messages as well as matching search completions from remote servers.

The second stage illustrates the application automatically presenting the user s labeled home address derived from the user s ME card as a completion in the search table. The application detected a match between the user s entered query of 12 with the user s ME card that contained a home address label for 1234 A Street Santa . . . Since this match was derived from the user s ME card the application prioritizes this locally derived information and displays it near the top of the list of suggested search completions in the search table. The search table also displays other search completions including Bob Smith 12 Hour Fitness and John Doe all derived from various local and remote resources. For instance Bob Smith is currently stored in a contact list on the users device.

The third stage illustrates the user selecting the directions to home. The fourth stage illustrates the application displaying a map with a route corresponding to directions from the user s current location to the user s home.

The application may also analyze other information or labels stored in a user s contact list or contact card. illustrates an example in four stages of a user entering a partial search term and obtaining directions to their work address derived from their contact card. Specifically this figure illustrates that the mapping application of some embodiments lists the directions to the work address at the top or near the top of the search table.

In the first stage the user taps the search field to begin the process of entering their search query. During the second stage the user has entered a partial search term Wo that the application detects as a part of an address label for Work or A s Work stored in work label field of the user s contact card or ME card . The application presents the user s labeled work address as a completion in the search table in some embodiments. As shown the user s labeled work address at the top of the search table . Underneath this suggested search completion the mapping application displays text e.g. Current Location to indicate the route is from the current location to home. However as mentioned above the mapping application of some embodiments instead may display the destination address instead of or in conjunction with displaying this text or does not display the text nor the destination address.

As described above the mapping application of some embodiments displays any information matched and derived from the contact list of the user s device near the top of the list of items in the search table but below the information matched and derived from the user s ME card. For instance the search table also lists towards the top of the search table but below the user s labeled work address the contact information for Bob Woods derived from another contact card stored in the user s contact list. The search table next lists World Market as a suggested search completion provided by a remote server.

The order that each suggested search completion is listed in the search table may be derived from various ranking algorithms and heuristics that rank the strength of the relationship between the search query terms and the suggested search completion. One such heuristic is described further below. In some embodiments search completions derived from local sources e.g. a contact list generally receive a higher priority than information derived from the remote servers. These search completions are likewise displayed at the top of the search table.

The third stage illustrates the user selecting the list item corresponding to directions to Work from the search table. The fourth stage illustrates the application displaying a map with a route corresponding to directions from the user s current location to the user s work.

Search completions listed in the search table may also be obtained in some embodiments by accessing a variety of other information stored locally on a user s device. For instance some embodiments may analyze bookmark information stored on the user s device. Each bookmark may contain various location information for places in which the user has indicated an interest. illustrates four stages of a user entering a partial search query and selecting a bookmark from the list of search completions in the search table.

In the first stage the user taps the search field to begin the process of entering their search information. During the second stage the user has entered a partial search term Bur in the search field. The application matches this partial query term to various local and remote suggestions. The application matches include Burt Smith Burger Palace and directions to Royal Burgers. For this search query the application presents the user s labeled bookmark as a suggested search completion in the search table. In particular the application has matched Bur to Burger Palace because this restaurant is currently stored as a bookmark in the user s device as indicated by the bookmark icon next to Burger Palace. 

In some embodiments the information matched with the bookmarks of the user s device may be displayed in a particular sorted order within the search table. Some embodiments display the search completions derived from the bookmarks below the search completions derived from the user s contacts list. However the search completions derived from the bookmarks may still be displayed above any of the remote server search suggestions. The search field in stage illustrates that the contact Burt Smith is still displayed at the top of the list of suggested search completions since this was derived from a contact list on the user s device. Likewise the user s bookmark for Burger Palace is displayed as the second item in the search table and directions from current location to Royal Burgers is displayed at the bottom of the list.

The search table in some embodiments may define a different priority order for displaying the items that are derived from the local sources on the device. For instance some embodiments may factor the search history and frequency that a user selects different suggested search completions in order to determine the particular order that the suggested search completions are presented in the search table. For instance if a user frequently searches for and selects Burger Palace corresponding to a bookmark on the device the application may display this suggested search completion at the top of the list and Burt Smith corresponding to a contact card as the second item in the list displayed in the search table. The third stage shows the user s selection of a bookmark for Burger Palace. The fourth stage shows a pin and a banner for Burger Palace. 

As described above for any particular search query the search table is filled with search completions from 1 local sources e.g. bookmarks contacts recent searches recent route directions etc. and 2 remote server sources. The particular display order that the suggested search completions are displayed in the search table is derived using a variety of heuristics. In some embodiments in general the display order prefers search completions derived from local sources over those derived from remote sources.

The process begins by retrieving or receiving at the search query entered in the search field. The process then retrieves at matching information from one or more local sources. As mentioned above local sources in some embodiments include the user s contact list bookmarks search histories and recent directions. The process may match the query term with several information and labels stored in the contact card including an address label phone number name or URL among other information stored in the contact card. The process may also match the search query with other local information including bookmarks and user search history information.

Next the process determines at the display order for the retrieved matches from the local sources. In some embodiments the process first orders matches from each local source based on certain criteria e.g. frequency of usage of the completions strength of association between search query and a match etc. and takes only a certain number e.g. three of top matches from each local source. In some embodiments the process orders the retrieved matches based on the local sources. For instance the process displays the matches in an order of the ME card the contact list bookmarks and search histories. Other embodiments may have different order. The process then displays at the retrieved matches from the local sources in the search table according to the determined at display order.

The process then receives or retrieves at search suggestions from remote sources e.g. remote map servers by sending the search query to the remote sources. In some embodiments the process sends the search query to the remote sources and looks into the local sources to find matching information at the same time. In some embodiments the servers may apply their own search ranking algorithm to identify and score particular search suggestions. The server may then send a particular number of identified search results to the mapping application which the process may order and filter at using own heuristics e.g. frequency of usage of the completions strength of association between search query and a match etc. . For instance in some embodiments the process would suggest the top three server search suggestions in list of suggested search completions in the search table. Next the process displays at the matches from remote sources below the matches from the local sources. The process then ends.

Some embodiments may immediately present the local search suggestions and adjust these suggestions to include remote server suggestions as these are received from the server which provides a quasi real time feel to the search process. For instance if the search table provides enough screen space to list ten individual search completions or suggestions the process may initially list all ten of these search suggestions from locally derived sources e.g. bookmarks contacts search histories . The process may then replace these local search suggestions with suggestions received from the servers as they are obtained through the network. The process may constantly update the particular list of search suggestions as more information is received from the servers that may be considered more important than the information listed in the search table.

The first stage shows that the mapping application has a top bar that includes a set of controls including a search field and a list view control for showing a list of search results. In some embodiments the mapping application displays this list view control in the top bar upon completion of a search based on a search query as shown. In other embodiments the mapping application places the list view control in the search field . Yet in other embodiments the mapping application places the list view control by sliding the list view control out from under the 3D icon .

In some such embodiments the mapping application displays the list view control when the mapping application displays the search results in the map. In this example the first stage shows that the mapping application has run a search using Pizza as a search query. The mapping application displays search results as two pins and in a map view. The mapping application of some embodiments also displays an informational banner for one of the two pins which indicates that the point of interest POI represented by the pin is the top suggested result. The first stage also shows that the user is selecting the list view control .

The second stage shows that the mapping application is displaying a list of POIs that the mapping application has found using the search query. The list has three POIs in this example. The first two POIs correspond to the pins and respectively. The mapping application does not show a pin that corresponds to the third POI Pizza Planet because the third POI is not located within the region of the map that includes the first two POIs. In some embodiments the mapping application shifts the map to display another region when a POI selected from the list is not located within the region of the map that is currently displayed.

The third stage shows that the mapping application is receiving a selection of the third entry. The fourth stage shows that the mapping application has shifted the map to display another region of the map that includes a pin that corresponds to the third POI. In some embodiments the mapping application displays an animation for a duration of time to show that the map is being shifted to another region of the map. In some embodiments the mapping application displays an informational banner for the third POI because the pin for the POI is the only pin in the map region.

The search query parser receives the search queries that user types in through an input manger not shown of the device . The query parser sends parsed queries to the search completion manager so that the search completion manager can generate search requests to the remote sources manager and the local sources manager . The search query parser also receives a tap input on a search field e.g. the search field and notifies the search completion manager of such input so that the search completion manager can retrieve recent search completions and recent route directions from the recent search completions repository and the recent route directions repository .

The search completion manager looks up the recent search completions repository and the recent route directions when the search completion manager receives a notification from the search query parser that the user has tapped the search field when the search field is empty. In some embodiments the search completion manger retrieves search completions and route directions used for a certain period of time e.g. hours days weeks etc. before the tap input is received.

The search completion manager also directs the remote sources manager and the local sources manager to look for search completions based on the parsed search queries. The search completion manager then receives search completions and route directions that the remote source manager and the local sources manager return.

The search completion manager gathers the recent search completions the recent route directions the search completions and route directions received from the remote and local sources mangers and respectively and filters out any duplicate completions and directions. The search completion manager then send these completions and directions to the list manager .

The list manager orders the search completions and driving directions based on certain criteria. As mentioned above these criteria include the time which the search completions and route directions are used whether the completions and route directions are from the local sources or the remote sources etc. The list manger then passes the ordered list to a display manager not shown of the device so that it can be displayed for the user.

The search completion manager also relays search requests i.e. complete search queries selected from search completions list or search query that had been typed in the search field at the time the user selects enter or search control and selected route directions and passes the requests and directions to a search request manager not shown which will conduct searches using the search requests or compute routes. The search completion manager stores the search requests i.e. search completions actually used to conduct searches and selected route directions i.e. identifications of starting and destination locations in the recent search completions repository and the recent route directions repository respectively.

The recent completions repository and the recent route directions repository are memory spaces to store recently used search requests and directions that have recently been used to compute routes. In some embodiments the two repositories are caches for quick access.

The local sources manager looks up the contacts repository and the bookmarks repository to find contacts e.g. ME cards and bookmarks that at least partially match the parsed search queries received from the search completion manger . The local sources manager then generates search completions based on the matching contacts and bookmarks and return them to the search completion manager . The contacts and bookmarks stored in the repositories and are generated maintained and or accessed by applications that run on the device and these applications include the mapping application .

The remote sources manager sends the parsed search queries received from the search completion manager to one or more servers not all shown including the search and map server . The remote sources manager receives search completions and or route directions returned from the search and map server in response to the search queries sent to the server . The remote source manager then sends the completions and route directions to the search completion manger .

As shown the search and map server includes a search completions repository and a route directions repository . In some embodiments the search and map server stores search requests and route directions that were used to compute routes in the repositories and . The search and map server receives these search requests and route directions from devices including the device that run instances of the mapping application of some embodiments such as the mapping application . The search and map server then generates a suggested search completions and route directions to the device . In some embodiments the search and map server includes two servers serving map data and generating routes respectively. The search completions repository and the route directions repository of some embodiments are data storage structures for storing search request and route directions.

In addition to allowing a user to initiate a search the presence of the search field in the primary map view in some embodiments also allows users to see the query corresponding to search results on the map and to remove those search results by clearing the query. illustrates the user clearing results from a map in three stages .

The first stage illustrates the map displaying a pin for Pizza Place. This pin may have been placed on the map through various different mechanisms. For instance the user may have dropped a pin on the map and received a reverse direction s lookup or the user may have entered a search query for Pizza Place . 

The second stage illustrates the user selecting an X button within the search field that is used to clear any search query displayed in the search field . Furthermore when clearing the search query all search results pins displayed on the map that are related to the displayed search query will also be cleared from the map . The third stage illustrates that after the user selects the X button the search field is now empty and the pin for Pizza Place is no longer displayed on the map.

The first stage shows the device after the mapping application has opened. The second stage illustrates the application displaying a search table after receiving the user s tapping of the search field. This search table is displayed regardless of whether or not the user provides any search terms in the search field. The search table provides a list of suggested search completions including recently searched terms and route directions. In particular the search table indicates that the user recently searched for John Smith and Pizzeria. The search table also lists the user s recent route directions which includes directions to Royal Burgers illustrated at the bottom of the search table . Also the search table lists an option to obtain directions from the user s current location to their home address which is illustrated as the first item of the search table . The top bar includes the direction control and the bookmark control .

The second stage illustrates the user s selection of the directions to Home. The second stage also illustrates that the mapping application of some embodiments removes the direction control and the bookmark control from the top bar . The mapping application inserts a cancel control .

The third stage illustrates the mapping application displaying a route corresponding to directions from the user s current location to their home. As shown the route has two pins for the start and ending points of the route. The mapping application of some embodiments also removes the cancel control from the top bar and places the clear control and the start control . The third stage also illustrates the selection of the clear control . The fourth stage illustrates that the search field is now empty and the pins for the start and end points for the route are no longer displayed on the map because the mapping application of some embodiments removed them from the map upon receiving the selection of the clear control .

When the user is viewing the map in a certain view and executes a search query some embodiments will transition to a new map view that contains the search results for the user s query. The particular type of transition may include continuously adjusting the map zoom levels and possibly displaying an animation between the original map view and the new map view. The application considers a variety of factors in deciding the particular type of transition and whether or not to provide an animation between the different map views. Some factors may include the distance between the different map views given their particular zoom levels the data available for providing an animation between the map views the data bandwidth capabilities of the user s internet connection and various other factors.

The process begins by retrieving at the search results. The process then defines at the original region and the target region. The process in some embodiments considers the map being displayed to the user. The process defines this map display as the current map view that contains the original map region. The process then determines a proposed target map view with a target map region that it needs to display to the user in order to provide the optimal map view that displays some or all of the search results.

In some embodiments the process initially defines at the original region and the target region at the same zoom level. In some such embodiments the process initially keeps the zoom level for the original region and sets the zoom level of the target region to the zoom level of the original region. The process also sets the orientation of the target region to the orientation of the original region. Moreover different embodiments locate the target region differently. For instance the process in some embodiments defines the target region to include at least one search result. Also the process of some embodiments defines the target region by taking average coordinates of the search results and set the center of the target region to the average coordinate.

Next the process determines at whether the original region and the target region overlap at least partially. When the process determines at that the two regions overlap at least partially the process proceeds to which is described further below.

When the process determines at that the original and target regions do not overlap the process determines at whether the two regions are separated by more than a threshold distance. In some embodiments the process computes this threshold distance dynamically based on the current zoom levels of the original region and the target region. For instance the computed threshold value is inversely proportional to the zooming levels. That is the more the regions are zoomed in the shorter the computed threshold distance is.

When the process determines at that the two regions are separated by more than the threshold distance the process displays at the target region without animating from the original region to the target region. Otherwise the process displays at an animation to the target region from the original region. Different embodiments employ different animation techniques. For instance the process in some embodiments employs cross fading of the original region and the target region to transition from the original region to the target region. The process in some embodiments may transition from the original region to the target region as if the viewpoint of the virtual camera overseeing the original region is moving to the target region.

When the process determines at that the original region and the target region overlap at least partially the process determines at whether to modify the target region. The operation is described in further detail below by reference to . The process then determines at whether to display animation to target region. The operation is described in further detail below by reference to .

The process begins by determining at whether 1 the original region includes any search result and 2 the zoom level of the original region is less than a threshold zooming level i.e. the original region is not zoomed out more than a threshold zoom level . When the process determines at that the original region does not include any search result or the zoom level of the original region is not less than the threshold zooming level the process proceeds to which is described further below.

When the process determines at that the original region includes at least one search result and the zoom level of the original region is less than the threshold zooming level the process uses at the original region as the target region. The process then proceeds to which is described further below.

When the process determines at that the original region does not include any search result or the zoom level of the original region is not less than the threshold zooming level the process determines at whether the original region includes any search result. When the process determines at that the original region includes at least one search result the process proceeds to which is described further below.

When the process determines at that the original region includes no search results the process expands at the original region to include at least one search result and uses expanded original region as the target region. Different embodiments expand the original region differently. For instance in some embodiments the process expands in all directions from the center of the original region to include at least one search result while in other embodiments the process expands not in all directions from the center of the original region to include at least one search result. In some such embodiments the process expands in such a way to include a search result that is closest to border of the original region.

Next the process determines at whether 1 the most important result is outside the target region and 2 all search results in the target region are significantly less important. Different embodiments assess the importance of a search result differently. For instance some embodiments quantify the closeness of the search query to the search results and uses the quantified closeness to determine the importance. In particular the process of some embodiments would consider the closest search result as the most important search result. Other embodiments employ other techniques to assess the importance of a search report. Moreover the process of some embodiments will consider that a search result is significantly less important than another search result when the difference between the quantified closeness for the two search results is greater than a threshold difference.

When the process determines at that the most important result is outside the target region and all search results in the target region are significantly less important the process expands at by a certain size to include one or more search results. The process then loops back to to make another determination to see whether to expand the target region further.

When the process determines at that the most important result is not outside the target region or all search results in the target region are not significantly less important the process expands at the target region further when it is necessary to make sure the target region can accommodate any UI e.g. an informational banner associated with the search results. The process then ends.

The process begins by determining at whether the zoom levels of the original and the target regions are different in more than a first threshold difference. In some embodiments the first threshold difference represents the upper threshold difference between the zoom levels of the original and the target regions. In such case the zoom levels of the original and the target regions are considered significantly different.

When the process determines at that the zoom levels are significantly different the process displays at the target region without displaying an animation from the original region to the target region. When the process determines at that the zoom levels are not significantly different the process determines at whether the zoom levels are different in more than a second threshold difference. In some embodiments the second threshold difference represents the lower threshold difference between the zoom levels of the original and the target regions. When the difference between the zoom levels is below the upper threshold and the lower threshold value the zoom levels of the original and the target regions are considered moderately different.

When the process determines at that the zoom levels of the original and the target regions are moderately different the process displays at an animation from the original region to the target region. When the process determines at that the zoom levels of the original and the target regions are not moderately different nor significantly different the process determines at whether the original region includes all the search results.

When the process determines at that the original region includes all the search results the process ends. Otherwise the process proceeds to to determine whether displaying the animation would result in making more search results visible. The process in some embodiments examines the animation to see whether any search results would be rendered while the animation is displayed.

When the process determines at that displaying the animation would result in making more search results visible the process displays at the animation from the original region to the target region. Otherwise the process ends.

The second stage illustrates that the map is now at a more detailed zoom level i.e. zoomed in with several individual streets displayed including First Street Main Street and Second Street. The user is also tapping the search field to initiate a search. The third stage illustrates the user entering the search query Smithsonian into the search field and selecting Smithsonian Museum Washington D.C. from the suggested search completion list in a search table .

Upon selecting Washington D.C. the application instantly displays a map of Washington D.C. without providing any animation. Because Cupertino Calif. and Washington D.C. are separated by a significant on screen distance for the current map view and particular zoom level the application instantly jumps to the map of Washington D.C. without providing any animation in this example. For this given search the application has determined that the on screen distance between the map region displayed in the stage and the target map region required to display Washington D.C. is greater than a particular threshold and thus providing an animation for the given zoom level is not reasonable or feasible.

In some embodiments when the target map region is too far away e.g. beyond a threshold distance of hundreds of miles or thousands of miles from the currently displayed map region or the user s current location the mapping application displays a message e.g. Did you mean XYZ place in location A . . . to ask whether the user has really intended to search the far away target region. Alternatively or conjunctively the mapping application may audibly present the message e.g. by reading the message to the user. In some embodiments the mapping application does not provide the search results until the user responds to the message. In some embodiments the mapping application provides alternative search results in addition to the message. For instance the mapping application may provide a list of search results e.g. Smith s Onion Cupertino Calif. that could be found within or near the currently displayed region or may provide the results of running a search with a search query that is similar but is related to a location closer to the currently displayed region. If the user chooses the alternative results the mapping application will display the search results on a region of the map that is closer to the currently displayed region.

The second stage illustrates that the map is now at a more detailed zoom level with several individual streets displayed including First Street Main Street and Second Street. The user is also tapping the search field to initiate a search. The third stage illustrates the user entering the search query Coffee Shop into the search field and selecting Coffee Shop located at First Street from the suggested search completion list in the search table. Upon selecting Coffee Shop the application displays the same current map view that the user was viewing prior to the search request as shown in the fourth stage . Since the search result for Coffee Shop located at First Street may be viewed in the user s current map view the application does not need to adjust the zoom settings or provide any animation to display the target map region. The application has set the target map region containing the relevant search results to the current map region and in doing so has avoided changing between the views of different regions of the map.

The second stage shows the map of the current location at a detailed zoom level with several individual streets displayed including First Street Main Street and Second Street. Since the search results the tech companies in Cupertino are not located within the original current map region of the current map view the application of some embodiments expands the map view so that the target region includes all of the search results that are located in the target region. The mapping application of some embodiments also determines that an animation of the map view from the current map region to the target region is needed because the zoom levels of the current region and the target region are significantly different.

The third stage illustrates the map at a different zoom level. The mapping application displays the map at this zoom level only momentarily as part of the animation that the mapping application displays in order to zoom out of the map to a zoom level for displaying the target region that is bigger than the original region. In some embodiments the mapping application displays a 2D 3D transition as part of the animation.

The fourth stage illustrates the map at the zoom level of the target region. That is the mapping application has completed displaying the animation to the target region from the original region displayed at the second stage .

In some embodiments the mapping application varies the duration of an animation for transitioning from the original region to the target region based on the amount of change involved in the transition. For instance the mapping application of some embodiments animates the transition for a short duration when the original region and the target region are not too far or when the original and the target region overlap. The mapping application displays a longer animation when the distance between the two regions is relatively large e.g. hundreds of miles . In some such embodiments when the distance between the two regions is very large e.g. thousands of miles the mapping application may not display an animation at all.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a novel user interface for presenting different types of detailed information about a point of interest POI . This user interface is referred to as a stage in the description above and below. A stage in some embodiments includes a display area for displaying images of the POI and several tabs under which different types of information about the POI are grouped and presented to the user.

The mapping application of some embodiments provides several different ways to display a stage for a POI. As described above the mapping application of some embodiments displays a banner above each of the pins that are displayed as search results. The user can select an item in the banner for a POI to open up the stage for that POI. The mapping application also allows the user to open up the stage of a POI by selecting the POI from a list of POIs that the mapping application of some embodiments presents for the search results of a search query. The mapping application also allows the user to open up the stage after dropping a pin at a location. Moreover the mapping application allows the user to open up the stage for the current location.

The media display area of some embodiments is for displaying different media of the POI. In some embodiments the mapping application initially displays a 3D animation of the POI when the GUI is launched. For instance when the POI is a building the mapping application shows an animated 3D view of the building and the building s surroundings. In some embodiments the mapping application displays the building as if the building is viewed from a camera mounted on a helicopter that is circling around the top of the building.

Different embodiments generate the 3D animation 3D video presentation differently. For instance the 3D animation is a video clip captured by a video capture device of an object orbiting the earth or a manned or unmanned aircraft flying at lower altitudes e.g. a satellite a space shuttle an airplane a helicopter etc. .

The mapping application in some embodiments generates the 3D video presentation by performing a blending operation e.g. the three dimensional perspective blending operation on several images that are captured for a particular location by flying objects such as helicopters airplanes satellites etc. These images can be still images or images from a part of a video clip captured by these objects.

In some embodiments the 3D rending operation generates the video clips from multiple images by transitioning through the images in a set amount of time. In some embodiments this transition results in multiple video frames being generated by capturing different subsets of images from different perspective rendering positions in 3D scenes at different instances in time.

In some embodiments the mapping application generates the 3D video presentation by moving a virtual camera above and around the POI e.g. a building and its surroundings in the 3D immersive map view or in the flyover view. For instance the mapping application may move the virtual camera as if the virtual camera is shooting a video of the POI and the surroundings from a flying object circling around the top of the building. The virtual camera and the 3D immersive map view are described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702 entitled Rendering Maps concurrently filed with this application. This concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 035 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322702 is incorporated herein by reference.

When the data for the animated 3D view of the POI is not available e.g. the data is not available in the map server or other local storage the mapping application of some embodiments finds the next available type of image to display in the display area . For instance the mapping application may display a satellite view of the POI.

When the data for the animated 3D view of the POI is available but it requires some time to obtain the necessary data to display the animated 3D e.g. because of a slow network connection of the device to the source of the necessary data the mapping application of some embodiments identifies the next available type of media for that POI and displays that media in the media display area first. For instance the mapping application of some embodiments displays in the media display area a satellite image of the POI. In some embodiments in order to provide an animated effect the mapping application rotates e.g. clockwise the satellite image of the POI rather than statically displaying a 2D satellite image.

When enough data for displaying the animated 3D view is obtained the mapping application of some embodiments switches from displaying the satellite image of the POI to displaying the animated 3D view of the POI. The mapping application of different embodiments uses different effects to make the switch. For instance the mapping application of some embodiments cross fades the 2D satellite image into the animated 3D view of the POI. In other embodiments the mapping application may employ a Ken Burns effect to display the 3D animated view from the satellite image.

In some embodiments the mapping application determines the type of media of the POI to initially display in the media display area based on the type of POI that is selected. For instance when the POI is a restaurant the mapping application of some embodiments initially displays images of culinary dishes the restaurant offers or interior images of the restaurant. When displaying such images the mapping application of different embodiments employs different effects to display different images. The different effects that the mapping application may use include a Ken Burns effect vignette effect cross fading tiling slide show etc.

The mapping application of some embodiments overlays informational text on the media displayed in the media display area . In some embodiments the informational text is displayed toward the left side of the media display area as shown in the third stage . However the location of the informational text may be anywhere e.g. center in the media display area . In some embodiments the mapping application applies different effects to the portion of the media display area on which the informational text is overlaid so that the text appears legible. For instance the mapping application may change the color of that portion or make the portion blurry. In other embodiments the mapping application does not modify the image to make the informational text legible. Instead the mapping application adjusts the informational text to make it legible as the portion of the image overlaid by the text changes.

The mapping application of some embodiments may also switch to other types of media from the type of media that is initially displayed when the GUI is launched. For instance when the user selects an entry from the entries displayed under a media tab not shown the mapping application displays in the media display area the images associated with the selected entry or plays back in the media display area a video associated with the selected entry.

The tabs are tabs for displaying different sets of entries grouped for different types of information associated with the different tabs. In some embodiments the GUI initially includes an Info tab a Reviews tab and a Photos tab as shown. When the info tab is selected the mapping application displays in the information display area entries related to general information about the POI. As shown the general information about the POI includes a phone number a URL for the POI address etc. The entries to display when the reviews tab is selected include all the reviews gathered by information aggregation entities e.g. Yelp Facebook Twitter etc. and supplied to the mapping application. Similarly the entries to display when the photos tab is selected include photos gathered by the information aggregation entities. The tabs and entries displayed in the information display area is described in detail further below.

The top bar of some embodiments includes a back button for going back to the state prior to launching the GUI . When the map with search results had been displayed prior to displaying the GUI the back button would indicate that the mapping application goes back to displaying the map with the search results. When the list of POIs had been displayed prior to displaying the GUI the back button indicates that the mapping application goes back to displaying the list.

The operation of the GUI is now described. At the first stage the mapping application displays a pin and a banner as a result of entering a search query Famous Building. The next stage shows that user selects the arrow to launch the stage for this POI.

At the third stage the GUI has been launched. The mapping application displays the initial set of components of the GUI which includes the top bar the media display area the tabs and the information display area . In the media display area the mapping application displays an animated 3D view of the famous building and other buildings near the famous building.

The mapping application also displays informational text about the famous building on the left side of the media display area . The displayed information includes the name of the building the address star rating and the number of reviews as shown in media display area . Behind the text the mapping application initially displays an image of the famous building. As shown the building appears faded because the mapping application has faded the portion of the image that appears behind the information text in order to make the text more prominent and legible. At this stage the information display area displays general information about this building e.g. phone number URL of the building address etc. because the info tab is a default tab selection in some embodiments.

The next stage shows that the viewpoint of the virtual camera has changed such that the famous building appears next to the displayed informational text. Some other neighboring buildings are displayed behind the informational text. The viewpoint of the virtual camera also starts to circle around the top of the famous building.

The next stage shows that the virtual camera has moved to another side of the famous building. As shown the FMS BLDG shown on a side of the building now appears in a southwest direction of the media display area in order to show that the virtual camera has moved counterclockwise with respect to the top of the building. The encircled H on top of the building also appears rotated since the last stage . Furthermore because the viewpoint of the virtual camera has changed different neighboring buildings are displayed behind the informational text.

The next stage shows that the virtual camera has moved to yet another side of the famous building. The virtual camera has kept moving and is now on the side of the building from which FMS BLDG is no longer visible. The encircled H on top of the building appears further rotated. The mapping application of some embodiments keeps showing this animated 3D animated view i.e. will have the virtual camera keep circling the top of the building until the user provides further input e.g. input to close the GUI selects photos from the entries under the photos tab etc. .

In some embodiments the mapping application uses a 3D rendering operation to generate 3D presentation in its other mode of operation. For example in some embodiments the mapping application uses this operation to generate a 3D video presentation whenever a user performs a search for a particular location or specifies other search criteria or whenever the user explores a location on the map. illustrates in five different stages an example of the mapping application using a 3D rending operation to show a particular search result.

The first stage illustrates the mapping application displaying a search table after receiving the user s entry of a first letter of a search query in the search field . As shown the search table includes several search completions including X Corp. X Station 555 . . . and Promenade X. The first stage also illustrates that the X Corp. is selected.

The second stage illustrates a 3D map view as indicated by the 3D control being highlighted. In some embodiments the mapping application automatically shows 3D animation of the POI when the user views the POI in 3D mode. The mapping application of some such embodiments still allows the user to rotate the map view e.g. with two finger gesture . In some embodiments the mapping application starts presenting 3D animation of the POI after a certain amount of time e.g. a few seconds elapses without receiving input from the user. The second stage also illustrates that the mapping application starts to present 3D animation of the building. As shown the 3D animation is showing sides and of the X Corporation s building with side having X Corporation s name. In this example the 3D animation is a 3D video presentation shot from a flying object circling counterclockwise around the top of the building.

The third stage illustrates that the viewpoint has changed and the building appears to rotate clockwise as the flying object is circling counterclockwise. The 3D presentation is showing sides and of the X Corporation s building. The H sign on top of the building has also been rotated as shown.

The fourth and fifth stages and show further rotations of the building as the flying object is circling clockwise. The mapping application of some embodiments repeats the 3D presentation until the user provides an input e.g. two finger gesture input to exit the 3D mode etc. that stops or changes the animation.

At the first stage the mapping application displays a pin and a banner as a result of entering a search query MyWork Building. The user has also selected the lower right corner of the map to peel off the map and display a set of buttons which are described above. The next stage shows the user selecting the list button to cause the mapping application to display the search results as a list.

At the third stage the mapping application displays a list of POIs after the user has selected list button at the previous stage . The list in this example happens to include only one POI because the search query was sufficiently targeted for a specific result. The next stage shows the user selecting the entry to launch the stage for this POI. As shown the user has selected the MyWork Building POI.

At the fifth stage the GUI has been launched. However in contrast to the stage described above by reference to the mapping application displays a satellite image of the actual building associated with the MyWork Building POI. The satellite image also shows other buildings near the building rather than an animated 3D view of the building. The satellite image is a 2D image of the top of the building taken from a significant distance from the top of the building i.e. from a satellite . As shown the mapping application also fades the portion of the image overlaid by the informational text so that the text appears clearly legible.

The next stage shows that the mapping application has rotated the satellite image clockwise to animate the satellite image. At the next stage the mapping application is cross fading the satellite image with the 3D animated view of the building because the mapping application has obtained enough data e.g. from the map server or other source of the data to display the 3D animated view of the building.

The next stage shows that the virtual camera for the 3D animated view has moved to another side of the MyWork Building. As shown the black corner of the building now appears on the east direction of the media display area in order to show that the virtual camera has moved counterclockwise with respect to the top of the building. Also because the viewpoint of the virtual camera has changed different neighboring buildings are displayed behind the informational text as shown.

The first and second stages and are similar to the stages and respectively in that the mapping application displays a set of POIs from which the user may select a POI. The second stage shows the user selecting a Little Coffee Shop. 

At the third stage the GUI has been launched. However in contrast to the stages and described above by reference to the mapping application displays a set of images e.g. images of coffee donuts etc. rather than the images of the buildings. These images as mentioned above are gathered by information gathering entities such as Facebook Twitter etc. from which the mapping application obtains the information related to the selected POI.

Also as mentioned above the mapping application of different embodiments employs different techniques to display the images. In this example the mapping application is using a Ken Burns effect to sequentially display the images. The mapping application at this stage displays an image of a cup of coffee and a muffin that the Little Coffee Shop offers to customers it is assumed that the customer or the owner of the shop snapped the image uploaded it to an information gathering entity such as Yelp .

The next stage shows that the mapping application has zoomed in on the cup of coffee and the muffin as part of showing the images using the Ken Burns effect. The next stage shows that the mapping application is applying a cross fade to the image of the coffee and muffin with an image of the interior of the Little Coffee Shop. The next stage shows that the mapping application has completely zoomed in on the image of the interior.

The process begins by receiving at a selection of a POI. The process receives the selection in one of several different ways. For instance the process receives the selection when the user selects an arrow displayed in a banner displayed above a pin for the POI about which the user wishes to find more information. The process may also receive the selection when the user selects one of the POIs from a list of POIs that the mapping application of some embodiments displays upon the user s selection of a list button.

The process next determines at the preferred order for displaying the different types of images. As mentioned above there are different types of images that the mapping application of some embodiments displays. In some embodiments the different types of images include images for the animated 3D view satellite images plain map images images related to businesses e.g. images of dishes offered images of the interior setting images of employees of the business etc. .

In some embodiments the process determines the preferred order based on the type of POI selected. For instance when the POI is a business such as a restaurant the process favors displaying images of available dishes offered by the restaurant. When the POI is a famous landmark like the Empire State Building the process favors displaying images of the building and its surroundings. The process analyzes the data for the selected POI to determine the type of POI when determining the preferred order.

There are also different levels of images for a particular type of image. For instance for images of landmarks the different levels of images include animated 3D images satellite images plain map images etc. These different image levels will contain different amounts of data and therefore take different amounts of time to retrieve the data through the network. For instance the animated 3D images will likely contain the most amounts of data and therefore take the longest to download over the network from the source of the data.

The process then determines at whether the data for the current level of images is available from the source. The process in some embodiments obtains the data from a map server or other server that serves the data upon receiving a request. However not every POI has every level of images in the server. For instance a building that is not well known or famous will likely not have image data for displaying a 3D animated view of the building. In some embodiments by default the current level of images to display is initially set to the 3D animated images level.

When the process determines at that the data for the current level of images is not available the process selects at the next level of images to display for the POI. For instance when the images for the animated 3D view are not available for the selected POI the process selects at the satellite image of the POI. The process then loops back to to determine whether the data for this next level of images is available.

When the process determines at that the data for displaying the current level of images is available the process determines at whether all of the data has been received and whether the mapping application is ready to display the current level of images. In some cases when the device on which the mapping application is running has a slow network connection through which to obtain the image data from the remote servers there might not be enough image data to display the current level of images for the POI.

When the process determines at that sufficient data for displaying the current level of images has been obtained the process proceeds to which is described further below. When the process determines at that the data for displaying the current level of images is not available the process displays at the next level of images ready to be displayed. That is the process displays at one of the next levels of images for which enough data has been obtained. When none of the next levels of images have enough data for displaying the images the process displays a plain background image a black image in the media display area.

The process then determines at whether the mapping application has obtained enough data for the current level of images. For instance when the process displays a satellite image of the POI in the media display area the process checks whether enough data for the animated 3D view has been obtained. When the process determines at that insufficient data for the current level of images has been obtained the process loops back to and keeps displaying the next level of images in the media display area while checking whether the data for the current level of images is ready.

When the process determines at that enough data for the current level of images has been obtained the process switches at from the next level of images being displayed in the media display area to the current level of images. For instance when the data for the 3D animated view is ready for display while displaying the satellite image of the POI the process switches to the animated 3D view of the POI from the satellite image of the POI. Different embodiments use different techniques to make this switch. For instance the process may apply a Ken Burns effect to make the transition from the next level of images to the current level of the images. The process next displays at the current level of images. The process then ends.

As mentioned above the tabs are tabs for displaying different sets of entries grouped for different types of information associated with the different tabs. That is the mapping application of some embodiments obtains the data that is related to the POI from different data gathering entities e.g. tweets RSS feeds updates from Facebook Yelp Yahoo Twitter blogs etc. and categorizes the data into different groups based on the type of information contained in the data. For instance the mapping application would categorize pieces of data carrying reviews about the POI into a reviews group and display them as entries in the information display area when the user selects the reviews tab. Different embodiments use different techniques to recognize the type of information that a piece of data is carrying. For instance the mapping application looks for a set of keywords in the pieces of data.

Examples of tabs that the user might create or the mapping application may additionally provide include activities or events tabs which when selected would include any time related information about the POI. For example if the selected POI is a Major League ballpark the entries under this tab may include information about the scheduled games for the team associated with the ball. As another example when the selected POI is a movie theater a selection of an entry may cause the mapping application to launch a ticket purchase application e.g. Fandango which the user can use to buy tickets for the available movies at that theater. One of ordinary skill will recognize that there are many other possible tabs that may be created with various functionality corresponding to the type of tab.

In some embodiments the mapping application allows the user to create a new group by defining several keywords that the mapping application uses to sift the obtained pieces of data. In these embodiments the mapping application adds a new tab for the new group and lists the pieces of data that include the keywords when the new tab is selected. When the mapping application includes a threshold number of tabs that can be displayed for a stage of the POI the mapping application of some embodiments renders the tabs scrollable e.g. horizontally so that the user can scroll the tabs and select any desired tab. The mapping application of some embodiments also allows the user to remove an undesired tab.

As mentioned above the GUI is scrollable vertically. However the tabs will not get scrolled off the screen of the device regardless of the user s scrolling of the GUI . That is for example when the GUI is scrolled upward such that the tabs would have fallen off of the screen the mapping application of some embodiments keeps the tabs within the screen display area and slides the information display area underneath the tabs .

An example operation of the GUI when the user scrolls the GUI is described by reference to the four stages of . The first stage shows the GUI that is launched after the user s selection of the Little Coffee Shop from the map displaying the pin and banner for this POI or from the list of POIs.

The second stage shows the user making an upward swiping gesture from a location of the GUI . The third stage shows that the media display area the tabs and the information display area have moved up within the screen. In particular the media display area has almost entirely been scrolled off the screen appearing to have slide underneath the top bar . The mapping application has also expanded the information display area to display more entries for the selected info tab. The user is also making another upward swiping gesture or continuing the initial upward swiping gesture with or without pause to scroll the GUI further up.

The fourth stage shows that the tabs have moved up below the top bar and the user moving the GUI even further up. However the tabs have not fallen off of the screen nor slid underneath the top bar . The mapping application has also stopped expanding the information display area . As the user scrolls up the GUI further the mapping application slides entries displayed in the information display area underneath the tabs and the top bar and brings out from the bottom of the information display area more entries that were previously not displayed in the information display area as shown in the fourth stage .

The fourth stage also illustrates that the mapping application of some embodiments displays a set of selectable UI items . The UI item is for showing directions to the POI from the current location. The UI item is for showing directions from the POI to the current location. The UI item is for adding this POI into the contacts list of the mapping application. The UI item is for sharing this POI with other mapping applications for other devices of other users. The UI item is for adding this POI as a bookmark.

In some embodiments when an entry is selected from a list of entries displayed upon a selection of a tab of the stage for a selected POI the mapping application launches a third party application or opens up the third party s website in a browser application that is concurrently running on the device on which the mapping application is running. The third party application is typically the source e.g. Yelp of the selected entry. For example when the user taps on a review displayed in the information display area the mapping application of some embodiments launches the third party application e.g. a Yelp application to show the full text of the selected review or to allow the user to add a new review. In these embodiments the mapping application will also provide means for the user to get back to the stage for the POI e.g. the GUI . For instance the mapping application may display a back button in a top bar for the third party application which when selected will cause the stage for the POI to re display.

In other embodiments the mapping application does not launch a third party application when an entry is selected from the list of entries. Instead the mapping application will display the information associated with the entry in place. That is for example the mapping application may expand the entry in the information display area and display the full review or provide the means to add a new review without leaving the mapping application. The mapping application of these embodiments would utilize an application programming interface API to request and obtain the full review from the source. The API in some embodiments is provided by the source e.g. Yelp .

The first stage of illustrates a user s selection of the reviews tab . In the second stage the mapping application upon receiving the selection displays several reviews related to the Little Coffee Shop. As shown the reviews originate from different sources such as Twitter Facebook Yelp etc. In some embodiments each review entry includes limited amounts of information. The mapping application of some of these embodiments allows the user to view the full review when the user selects the particular entry.

The second stage displays a user s selection of a review from the list of reviews displayed in the information display area . In this example the review originated from Yelp as shown. The third stage shows that the mapping application has launched the Yelp application. The Yelp application displays the full content of the review . The top bar of the page includes a back button which when selected causes the mapping application to display the GUI again with the reviews tab selected. The third stage also shows the user selecting the back button. The fourth stage shows the GUI displayed once again. This stage shows the GUI identical to the GUI at stage .

The first stage illustrates a user s selection of the reviews tab when the info tab is the currently selected tab. In the second stage the mapping application in response to receiving the selection of the reviews tab displays reviews related to the Little Coffee Shop. As shown each review entry includes a thumbnail image of the person star rating of the person the date the review was uploaded and the review depicted as lines . The reviews originate from different sources such as Twitter Facebook Yelp etc. The second stage also illustrates that the user is scrolling up the GUI .

The third stage illustrates that the mapping application of some embodiments displays a set of selectable UI items towards the bottom of expanded information display area as the GUI is scrolled up. The UI item is for launching a third party application e.g. Yelp s mobile application or a website e.g. Yelp s website to view more reviews on the POI. The UI item is for launching another third party application e.g. Facebook s mobile application or a website e.g. Facebook s website to trigger a special feature that the third party application offers e.g. check in from Facebook . The UI item is for adding a quick tip. In some embodiments a quick tip is a type of review in which the mapping application does not have to rely on a third party application i.e. without going through the third party application or a website . The UI item is for adding a review. In some embodiments the selection of the UI item causes the mapping application to launch a third party application or a website to leave a review. The third stage also shows the selection of the UI item .

The fourth stage illustrates a third party application e.g. Yelp s mobile application that allows the user to add a review about the POI.

In some embodiments the information provided by a third party application e.g. Yelp may be different for different users based on the user s personal preferences for the particular third party application. In order to determine a particular user s preferences the mapping application communicates with the third party application to determine the user s preferences and to retrieve information tailored for the user. In some embodiments in order to display the user s personalized information from the third party application the user must have the third party application installed on the same device that the user is using to run the mapping application. Furthermore the user must also be currently logged into the third party application in some embodiments. For example a user must have the Yelp application downloaded on the same device they are using to run the mapping application and the user must be logged on the Yelp application at the time that they are accessing the Yelp feature from the mapping application. If the user satisfies these conditions the particular information about a POI that gets displayed using the mapping application for the user will be tailored according to their personal preferences. Thus different users will see different information on the POI based on the user s personal preferences.

In order to apply a particular user s preferences the mapping application and the third party application must first verify certain information. The mapping application initially verifies with the third party application that the user is currently logged into the third party application. After verifying that the user is currently logged into the application the mapping application forwards data related to the particular POI e.g. identification of the particular POI in which the user is interested to the third party application. The third party application retrieves the information related to the POI for the particular user and returns the information to the mapping application. The mapping application then displays the information in place e.g. without going to the third party application to the user according to the user s preferences in some embodiments.

In some embodiments the mapping application obtains authentication information e.g. a token from the third party application. The mapping application uses this token to access the server serving up the information about POIs to the third party application. For instance the Yelp application has been authenticated and authorized to access the Yelp server. Then the mapping application can be authorized to access the Yelp server by using the authentication information obtained from the Yelp application running on the same device. In these embodiments the user s personal preferences would be maintained by the server so that when the mapping application asks for information e.g. reviews about a POI the server returns the information that is conforming to the user s preferences. In other embodiments it is not required that the user has logged into the third party application. In these embodiments the mapping application may have the user log in directly to the server through the mapping application.

During the first stages both users are viewing the map view of the mapping application. They have both searched for Little Coffee Shop using the search bar. Both users are also selecting the arrow not shown blocked by fingers and of the users and respectively to launch the stage of the POI. At the second stages the GUI has been launched. The mapping application displays various information regarding the POI including the address telephone number URL for the website and user reviews as shown. The users and are both also selecting the reviews tab to obtain information regarding user reviews of the coffee shop.

At the third stages the GUI shows the reviews obtained from the third party application e.g. Yelp . However the user reviews that are displayed are different for the two users and because these reviews are retrieved based on the user s personal preferences. The first user sees three reviews by Jane Bo and Sue whereas the second user sees reviews from Jon Brad and Nat. This may occur when the users and have specified different personal preferences for the particular third party application. The first user may have indicated to the third party application i.e. Yelp in this example that the user only wants to see reviews made by food experts and thus the reviews from Jane Bo and Sue who are experts are displayed. The second user may have indicated that the user wants to see reviews from everyone and thus the reviews from Jon Brad and Nat who may be experts and non experts are displayed. Thus each user obtains information from the third party application for a particular POI that is customized and tailored to their personal preferences.

In some embodiments the mapping application displays a tag on a tab of the GUI to indicate an entry which would be displayed upon selection of the tab includes special information about the POI. For instance a tag could be a deal tag that shows the POI has a deal and that information about the deal may be included in one of the entries that would be displayed upon the selection of the tag or the tab that has the tag on it. As such a tag serves as an unread mark that indicates that there is an entry that the user has not viewed since the entry was obtained from its respective source.

The first stage shows the GUI . The reviews tab has a tag attached to the tab. In some embodiments the tag appears on the tab when an entry that includes information about the deal of the POI exists. The mapping application of different embodiments uses different appearances of tags. For instance in some embodiments the tag resembles a physical tag that is attachable to a document. The tag also includes one or more dollar signs to indicate that the POI has a money saving deal for the customers of the POI.

The next stage displays a selection of the tag e.g. by tapping . The third stage shows that the tag has disappeared from the tab and an entry for the deal is displayed in the information display area . In some embodiments the mapping application instead launches a third party application or opens up the third party s website in a browser application that is running on the device on which the mapping application is running. The third party application or the webpage will then show the details of the deal for the selected POI.

At the first stage the mapping application displays a pin and a banner . The banner may be the result of a user entering a search query for Little Coffee Shop . The second stage illustrates the user selecting the arrow to launch the stage for this POI. At the third stage the mapping application has launched the GUI for the stage. The GUI is displayed in its entirety within the map view of the mapping application. In some embodiments when the user is viewing the mapping application in a portrait orientation the mapping application displays the stage for a particular POI in its entirety. In some embodiments when the user views the mapping application on a tablet in a landscape orientation the mapping application displays the stage for the POI but the user may be required to scroll through the stage to view all of the information.

As mentioned above the mapping application tightly integrates the search and route identification experience by providing several different ways to get directions. One such way is through a selectable direction UI control e.g. button on the main map view e.g. in the top left corner which when selected presents a modal interface for editing directions and that enables the user to request more customized routes such as routes that do not begin from the current location or a walking route instead of just driving routes.

In some embodiments the mapping application allows the user to inspect these customized routes by sliding the signs showing maneuver instructions in and out of the UI page showing a route. This mode of operation of the mapping application is referred to as a route inspection mode or manual stepping mode which is one of several modes of operation in which the mapping application of some embodiments is capable of operating. Examples of these operational modes include a navigation mode a map browsing mode and the route inspection mode.

A juncture is where two or more road segments meet. A route is a path between a starting location and a destination location in the map. A typical route has zero or many junctures along the path between the two locations. A maneuver instruction for a juncture in the route identifies the direction of the road segment to advance from the juncture. In some embodiments the mapping application provides the user with a maneuver instruction only for some of the junctures along the route because the user may not need to perform a maneuver at every juncture in the route in order to reach the destination location. For instance the user carrying the device may recognize that the user only needs to go straight by passing through several junctures until the user reaches a juncture at which to make a turn to get to the destination location. In this patent application when a juncture has a maneuver instruction to display that maneuver instruction is referred to as a step. 

In the navigation mode the mapping application of some embodiments provides the user with a set of steps for a route between the device s current location to a destination location. Typically the mapping application provides the user with these steps visually and audibly in the navigation mode. When the user carrying the device deviates from the route the mapping application of some embodiments tracks the location of the device and re calculates a new route from the deviated location in order to re direct the user to the destination location from the deviated location. In other words the mapping application of some embodiments operating in the navigation mode requires the device to be on a route at all times. Also the mapping application of some embodiments operating in the navigation mode displays the steps by popping up the step rather than sliding the steps in and out of the display area. Furthermore the information in the step i.e. the maneuver instruction that the mapping application displays while operating in the navigation mode is dynamic in some embodiments. That is information such as estimated time of arrival remaining time of the trip to the destination location remaining distance from the current location of the device to the destination location or the next juncture with next step etc. get updated by the mapping application as the device is moving along the route.

In the route inspection mode the mapping application of some embodiments allows the user to slide the steps in and out of the display area to inspect each step in the route. Alternatively the mapping application allows the user to manipulate the map e.g. by zooming in and out sliding the map in different directions to display different junctures in the route. When a juncture with a step is displayed in the display area as a result of the user s manipulation of the map the mapping application displays the step by sliding in the step and sliding in and out any intermediate steps between the previously displayed step and the currently displayed step . In this manner the user can inspect the route by manually sliding the steps in and out of the display area or by manipulating the map to display certain junctures of the route in the display area.

The second stage illustrates the selection of the route generation control . In some embodiments when the route generation control is selected the mapping application sends the starting and ending locations information to a remote server to obtain the routes. The third stage shows two routes route and route which the mapping application renders on the map based on the route information obtained from the remote server in some embodiments. The third stage also illustrates that the mapping application has selected route by default. The user selects the start control for starting the navigation according to the selected route. The mapping application of some embodiments starts to operate in the route inspection mode upon receiving a selection of the start control .

The fourth stage illustrates that the mapping application displays an instruction sign which in some embodiments is the first sign of a series of turn by turn instruction signs not all of them shown in the figure for browsing the selected route. The mapping application allows the user to browse the selected route by sliding the signs along a particular axis e.g. horizontally . These scrollable instruction signs are described in detail further below. In some embodiments the mapping application allows the user to browse the selected route when the starting location of the selected route is not the user s current location. Also the mapping application of some embodiments disables or does not display the page curl when the mapping application is in this mode for allowing the user to browse or inspect a selected route as shown in this stage .

In addition to entering starting and ending locations for the route in the starting and ending fields and the mapping application of some embodiments allows the user to select a route from a list of previously searched routes. illustrates an example in terms of four stages of a user s interaction with the mapping application to obtain routing directions. This example is provided in the context of using the direction control to obtain a route between two locations.

The first stage illustrates the mapping application displaying a map of a street view of a city. The user is initiating a tap of the direction control located at the top left corner of the display next to the search field . The second stage next illustrates that the application presents a search table with a list of recent route directions that the user has previously searched. In this example the user selects a route to a police station as shown.

The third stage illustrates the display of a map with the selected route between the device s current location to the destination for the selected route. This stage also illustrates the selection of the list view control . The fourth stage illustrates that the mapping application presents a list of turn by turn instructions to get to the destination. As shown each instruction in the list includes a direction icon that shows the directions for the particular turn associated with the instruction. In some embodiments each instruction in the list looks identical to a corresponding instruction sign described above by reference to .

The first stage illustrates a tablet device running a mapping application of some embodiments that is displaying a map view of a particular route between two locations. In particular the user has obtained a route between the user s current location and the location for the POI Pizza Place . The user may have obtained this route through several avenues including the search feature placing pins on the map and various other mechanisms. The mapping application is also displaying a set of floating controls including the list view control .

The second stage shows that the user is selecting the list view control to obtain a list of the routing directions. The third stage illustrates that the mapping application now displays the list of routing directions overlaid on a portion of the map view of the mapping application.

In some embodiments when the user selects individual routing directions from the list of routing directions the mapping application displays the corresponding portion of the route associated with the selected routing direction on the map. If the corresponding portion of the route is not within the currently displayed map region the mapping application shifts the map such that the region of the map that contains the corresponding portion is displayed.

In some embodiments the mapping application allows a user to select and scroll through a set of selectable UI items representing the signs of the junctures along a selected route when the application presents the identified route to the user. As the user scrolls through each sign the portion of the route associated with the currently in focus sign is presented or highlighted e.g. through color highlighting or through another geometry such as a circle or other mark marking the portion . This operational mode of the mapping application of some embodiments is referred to as a route inspection mode. The mapping application operating in this mode allows the user to inspect the road by manipulating the UI items representing the instructional signs of some junctures of the route. In some embodiments the mapping application operates in the route inspection mode 1 when the route being inspected is between two locations neither of which is the current location of the device on which the mapping application is running and 2 when the route is computed for walking as opposed to driving directions.

The third stage illustrates that a portion of the first scrollable sign has been scrolled off of the map display area and a new sign for the route has become partially visible. The user can see that the new sign displays a right turn arrow. The mapping application has not moved the current juncture indicator because the sign is still the current sign.

The fourth stage illustrates the display after the user has completed the swiping gesture of the first sign off of the map. The mapping application now displays the second sign for the list of routing directions as indicated by the 2 of 3 text displayed at the top bar . This sign indicates that in 0.1 miles the user needs to turn right onto 7th Street. Furthermore the application has zoomed in on a portion of the map display area and highlighted a new segment of the route corresponding to the currently in focus sign being presented. The application has also moved the current juncture indicator to the juncture indicated by the second sign .

Alternatively or conjunctively the user can scroll through each sign by selecting different junctures of the route e.g. by tapping or navigating the map through gestural input in order to view a particular scrollable sign associated with a particular juncture. illustrates in terms of three stages a user navigating the map in order to scroll through the different scrollable signs.

The first stage illustrates the map with the overlaid sign corresponding to the 2 of 3 sign in the route for a particular juncture of the route between the starting and ending points. The application has also highlighted the corresponding portion of the route for this sign. The sign states that in 0.1 miles the user needs to turn right onto 7th Street. The first stage also illustrates that the user initiated a swipe gesture to navigate the map e.g. swiping their finger to the right in order to view a different region of the map.

The second stage illustrates a new region of the map that is displayed after the swiping gesture corresponding to a shift to the left. The third stage illustrates that after the completed swiping gesture a new scrollable sign is now overlaid on the map corresponding to the portion of the route that is now displayed in this particular region of the map. This sign is the third sign in the route as indicated by the 3 of 3 text displayed at the top center of the map. The sign indicates that in 350 feet the user will arrive at the destination.

In order to navigate a set of routing directions the user has the option to either scroll through the signs overlaid on the map or navigate the map to scroll through the different signs. Also when the user taps on a particular section of the route the mapping application scrolls through the different signs to display a sign that corresponds to the particular section of the route. In some embodiments the mapping application displays the sign for a juncture that is closest to the tapped portion of the route.

This scrolling feature of the mapping application allows a user to quickly ascertain all of the necessary maneuvers when traveling between two locations. This may be especially helpful in driving situations that require a significant number of lane changes to anticipate upcoming turns.

In some embodiments the directional arrow shown in a scrollable instruction sign is a simple arrow. In other embodiments when there is sufficient space on a sign or presentation for the use of a bigger sign the mapping application of some embodiments in the navigation mode identifies a maneuver to perform at a juncture along a route by using a larger graphical directional indicator that includes 1 a prominent stylized arrow roughly representing the path of the vehicle and 2 a de emphasized set of lines and curves corresponding to other elements of the junction. In some embodiments that use this approach a right turn at a T junction will be represented by a large arrow with a right angle joined with a smaller dimmer segment that runs parallel to one of the large arrow s segments. The smaller segment in some embodiments will also be pushed off to the side so that the path taken by the vehicle dominates. More details about the arrows are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 121 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322634 entitled Context Aware Voice Guidance concurrently filed with this application. This concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 121 now published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0322634 is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments the mapping application uses a realistic looking road sign in place of the instructions with direction icons.

When the mapping application is running on a device with a larger display area the mapping application displays more signs in the display area at any given moment. In some embodiments the mapping application displays a row of signs in the top portion of the display area with the current sign in the middle of the top portion. The number of signs that the mapping application can display varies depending on the device s orientation. That is the mapping application can display more signs when the display area is in a landscape orientation than when the display area is in a portrait orientation.

The first stage shows that the mapping application is displaying three signs and a portion of a fourth sign . In this example the signs represent the first through the fourth instructions for the selected route that has a total of six steps. As a top bar indicates the second instruction of the route is the current instruction and the sign is highlighted and placed in the middle of the top portion of the display area to indicate the sign is representing the current instruction. The first stage also shows that the user is swiping the sign to the left.

The second stage shows that the mapping application is displaying the sign for the third instruction of the route in the middle of the top portion of the display area. In this example the mapping application has also highlighted the sign and the section of the route that corresponds to the sign is highlighted as shown. The top bar indicates that the current instruction is the third of the six instructions of the route. Also the sign is now mostly slid out of the display area and the sign is now displayed fully. The mapping application is also displaying a portion of a fifth sign that represents the fifth instruction of the route.

The mapping application of some embodiments allows the user to switch to an overview mode while reviewing a selected route by scrolling the instruction signs. In the overview mode the mapping application of some embodiments adjusts the zooming level of the map such that the entire route can be rendered on the map. The mapping application also allows the user to go back to the mode in which the user can resume reviewing the directional instructions. illustrates an example in terms of three stages of the user s interaction with the application to switch to the overview mode while reviewing a selected route.

The first stage is identical to the stage described above by reference to . That is the user has scrolled to the last instructional sign . The next stage illustrates the selection of an overview control .

The third stage illustrates the map in the overview mode. The mapping application of some embodiments shows the map in the overview mode in response to receiving the selection of the overview control . The mapping application has zoomed out the map such that the entire route is displayed within the map. In some cases the mapping application displays only a partial route from the current location of the device and the destination location when the current location of the device is very close e.g. within 100 meters to the destination location.

Also a top bar shows that the destination which in this example is Police Station is 7 minutes or 0.5 miles away from the current location of the device or the starting location for this particular route. The top bar now includes a resume control which in some embodiments is for resuming the navigation or inspection of the selected route. The mapping application also displays the list view control in the map.

The top bar also shows the end control . When the mapping application receives a selection of the end control while the mapping application is showing the overview of the selected route the mapping application of some embodiments stops inspection of the selected route by going back to map browsing mode. The mapping application of some embodiments goes back to the map browsing mode by removing the selected route from the map putting back the page curl replacing the information and controls in the top bar with a set of other controls including a direction control a search field and a bookmark control. The mapping application of some embodiments does not shift the map to another region when switching to the map browsing mode from the inspection mode. The mapping application of some embodiments leaves the pins for the starting and destination locations in the map when the mapping application goes to the map browsing mode.

The process begins by receiving at a selection of a route. As shown in above the mapping application of some embodiments provides a recommended route when there are two or more generated routes between the starting and ending locations. When the user does not select another route the mapping application takes the recommended route as the selected route upon receiving a selection of a start control such as the start control .

Next the process receives a user input for starting browsing mode. In some embodiments the mapping application enters the browsing mode when the user selects a start control such as the start control . At the process of some embodiments then displays a sign for the first juncture i.e. the starting location of the route and the sign s corresponding juncture i.e. the first juncture on the map.

The process then receives at a user input. In some embodiments the user input includes any gestural interaction with the mapping application. For instance the user can zoom or swipe a map by touching one or more locations of the map. The user may also tap swipe etc. the currently displayed sign.

The process then determines at whether the user input is for moving the currently displayed sign. In some embodiments the process determines that the user input is for moving the currently displayed sign when the user taps the sign or swipes the sign in a certain direction. When the process determines that the user input is not for moving the currently displayed sign the process proceeds to which is described further below.

When the process determines that the user input is for moving the currently displayed sign the process displays a neighboring sign if possible according to the user input. For instance the process displays the next or previous sign for the next or previous juncture in the route according to the user input. The process also displays the corresponding juncture of the route. In some embodiments the process may zoom or shift to another region of the map in order to display the corresponding juncture of the sign being displayed. The process then loops back to to receive another user input.

When the process determines at that the user input is not for moving the currently displayed sign the process determines at whether the input is for displaying a juncture other than the currently displayed juncture. In some embodiments the process determines that the input is for displaying a juncture when the user manipulates the map e.g. swipe zoom etc. to display another region of the map or when the user taps on a portion of the route that is closer to another juncture of the displayed route. When the process determines at that the user input is not for displaying another juncture the process proceeds to which is described further below.

When the process determines at that the user input is for displaying another juncture the process displays at the other juncture and the juncture s corresponding sign. This sign may not be a neighboring sign of the currently displayed sign. The process then loops back to to receive another user input.

When the process determines at that the user input is not for displaying another juncture the process determines at whether the user input is for showing an overview of the route. In some embodiments the process determines that the input is for displaying the overview of the route when the mapping application receives a selection of an overview control. When the process determines at that the user input is not for showing the overview of the route the process proceeds to which is described further below.

When the process determines at that the user input is for displaying the overview of the route the process of some embodiments displays at the entire route in the map. The process also receives another user input while displaying the overview of the route. The process then determines at whether the input is for ending the browsing mode. In some embodiments the process determines that the input is for ending the browsing mode when the mapping application receives a selection of an end control such as the end control described above by reference to . When the process determines at that the user input is for ending the browsing mode the process ends.

When the process determines at that the user input is not for ending the browsing mode the process determines at whether the input is for exiting the overview of the route. In some embodiments the process determines that the input is for exiting the overview when the mapping application receives a selection of a resume control such as the resume control described above by reference to .

When the process determines at that the input is not for exiting the overview mode the process loops back to to display the route and to receive another user input. When the process determines at that the input is for exiting the overview mode the process exits the overview of the route and displays at the sign and its corresponding juncture before showing the overview. The process then loops back to to receive another user input.

When the process determines at that the input received at is not an input for showing the overview of the route the process determines at whether the input is for ending the browsing mode. In some embodiments the process determines that the input is for ending the browsing mode when the mapping application receives a selection of an end control. When the process determines at that the user input is for ending the browsing mode the process ends. Otherwise the process loops back to to receive another user input.

The second stage shows the device after the mapping application has opened. As shown in this stage the mapping application s UI has a starting page that in some embodiments 1 displays a map of the current location of the device and 2 several UI controls arranged in the top bar and as floating controls.

The third stage of illustrates that the selection of the direction control opens the direction entry page which is shown in the fourth stage . The direction control is one of three mechanisms through which the mapping application can be directed to identify and display a route between two locations the two other mechanisms are 1 a control in an information banner that is displayed for a selected item in the map and 2 recent routes identified by the device that are displayed in the search field . Accordingly the information banner control and the search field are two UI tools that the application employs to make the transition between the different modalities seamless.

The fourth stage illustrates the user selecting one of the recent directions that was auto populated in the table . The fifth stage then shows three routes on a 2D map view between the specified starting and ending locations specified through the page . It also shows the selection of the second route and some information about this route in a bar at the top of the layout. This bar is shown to include start and end buttons. The start button is shown to be selected in the fifth stage.

As shown by the sixth stage the selection of the start button directs the application to enter a turn by turn navigation mode. In this example the application has entered a 2D turn by turn navigation mode. In other embodiments the application will enter by default into a 3D turn by turn navigation mode. In this mode the application displays a realistic sign that identifies the distance to the next junction maneuver in the navigated route and some other pertinent information. The application also displays a top bar that includes some information about the navigation as well as End and Overview buttons for respectively ending the navigation and obtaining an overview of the remaining portion of the navigated route or the entire portion of the navigated route in other embodiments.

The application further displays the floating 3D control and the floating list control which were described above. It should be noted that the list control was adaptively added to the floating control cluster upon entering the route inspection and route navigation modalities while the position indicator was removed from the floating control upon entering the route navigation modality. Also upon transition from the route inspection mode to the route navigation mode the application performs an animation in some embodiments that involves the page curl uncurling completely before the application transitions into the navigation presentation.

In some embodiments the animation transition includes removing the top bar its associated controls and the floating controls from the navigation presentation and moving the sign to the top edge of the presentation a short time period after starting the navigation presentation. As further described below the application requires the user to tap on the navigated map to bring back the top bar its controls and the floating controls and requires another tap to remove these controls again from the map in some embodiments. Other embodiments provide other mechanisms for viewing and removing these controls.

The navigation application of some embodiments can display navigation in either a 2D mode or a 3D mode. As mentioned above one of the floating controls is the 3D control that allows a user to view a navigation presentation in three dimensions 3D . illustrates how the navigation application of some embodiments provides the 3D control as a quick mechanism for entering a 3D navigating mode. This figure illustrates this operation in three stages . The first stage illustrates the user selecting the 3D control while viewing a two dimensional navigation presentation.

The second stage illustrates the navigation presentation in the midst of its transition into a 3D presentation. As shown in this figure the 3D control appears highlighted at this stage to indicate that the navigation presentation has entered a 3D mode. As mentioned above the navigation application generates the 3D view of the navigated map in some embodiments by rendering the map view from a particular position in the three dimensional scene that can be conceptually thought of as the position of a virtual camera that is capturing the map view. This rendering will be further described below by reference to .

The third stage then illustrates the navigation presentation at the end of its transition into the 3D appearance. As shown by the difference between the heights of the buildings in the second and third stages the transition from 2D to 3D navigation in some embodiments includes an animation that shows three dimensional objects in the navigated map becoming larger.

The navigation application of some embodiments is capable of displaying navigation maps from multiple perspectives. The application can show maps in three dimensions 3D or in two dimensions 2D . The 3D maps are generated simulations of a virtual scene as seen by a virtual camera. presents a simplified example to illustrate the concept of a virtual camera . When rendering a 3D navigation map a virtual camera is a conceptualization of the position in the 3D map scene from which the device renders a 3D view of the scene. illustrates a location in a 3D navigation map scene that includes four objects including two buildings and two intersecting roads. To illustrate the virtual camera concept this figure illustrates three scenarios each of which corresponds to a different virtual camera location i.e. a different rendering position and a different resulting view that is displayed on the device.

The first stage shows the virtual camera at a first position pointing downward at an angle e.g. a 30 degree angle from the horizon towards the 3D scene . By rendering the 3D scene from the position and angle shown in stage the application generates the 3D map view . From this position the camera is pointing at a location that is a moving position in front of the device. The virtual camera is kept behind the current location of the device. Behind the current location in this case means backward along the navigation application s defined path in the opposite direction from the current direction that the device is moving in.

The navigation map view looks as though it was shot by a camera from above and behind the device s location indicator . The location and angle of the virtual camera places the location indicator near the bottom of the navigation map view . This also results in the majority of the screen being filled with the streets and buildings ahead of the present location of the device. In contrast in some embodiments the location indicator is in the center of the screen with half of the screen representing things ahead of the device and the other half representing things behind the device.

The second stage shows the virtual camera at a different position pointing downward toward the scene at a larger second angle e.g. 45 . The application renders the scene from this angle resulting in the 3D navigation map view . The buildings and the roads are smaller than their illustration in the first navigation map view . Once again the virtual camera is above and behind the location indicator in the scene . This again results in the location identifier appearing in the lower part of the 3D map view . The location and orientation of the camera also results again in the majority of the screen displaying things ahead of the car carrying the device which is what someone navigating needs to know.

The third stage shows the virtual camera at a top down view that looks downwards on a location on a 2D map that corresponds to the location in the 3D map scene that was used to render the 3D views and . The scene that is rendered from this perspective is the 2D map view . Unlike the 3D rendering operations of the first and second stages that in some embodiments are perspective 3D rendering operations the rendering operation in the third stage is relatively simple as it only needs to crop a portion of the 2D map that is identified by a zoom level specified by the application or the user. Accordingly the virtual camera characterization in this situation somewhat unnecessarily complicates the description of the operation of the application as cropping a portion of a 2D map is not a perspective rendering operation.

In some embodiments the virtual camera can be made to move by changing the zoom level for viewing the map after the map enters a 3D mode as further described below. In some of these embodiments the application switches to a top down mode where the rendering position faces straight down that produces 2D views when the zoom level reaches a particular zoom out level. As in the third stage the mapping application in some embodiments switches from rendering a 3D scene from a particular perspective direction to cropping a 2D scene when the camera switches from the 3D perspective view to a 2D top down view. This is because in these embodiments the application is designed to use a simplified rendering operation that is easier and that does not generate unnecessary perspective artifacts. In other embodiments however the mapping application uses perspective rendering operation to render a 3D scene from a top down virtual camera position. In these embodiments the 2D map view that is generated is somewhat different than the map view illustrated in the third stage because any object that is away from the center of the view is distorted with the distortions being greater the farther the object s distance from the center of the view.

The virtual camera moves along different trajectories in different embodiments. Two such trajectories and are illustrated in . In both of these trajectories the camera moves in an arc and rotates more downward as the camera moves upward on the arc. The trajectory differs from the trajectory in that in the trajectory the camera moves backward from the current location as it moves up the arc.

While moving along one of the arcs the camera rotates to maintain a point ahead of the location indicator at the focal point of the camera. In some embodiments the user can turn off the three dimensional view and go with a purely two dimensional view. For example the applications of some embodiments allow a three dimensional mode to be turned on and off by use of a 3D button . The 3D button is essential to turn by turn navigation feature where it has a role as an indicator and toggle. When 3D is turned off the camera will maintain a 2D navigation experience but when 3D is turned on there may still be some top down perspectives when 3D viewing angles are not appropriate e.g. when going around a corner that would be obstructed in 3D mode .

As another way of allowing the user to get navigation experience the mapping application of some embodiments provides a UI item in an informational banner that appears by a pin that represents a POI. illustrates an example in terms of three stages of a user s interaction with the mapping application to obtain routing directions. This example is provided in the context of using a car icon .

The first stage illustrates a map in a 3D map view. As shown the 3D control appears highlighted to indicate that the map is in a 3D map view. The first stage also illustrates two informational banners for the two pins for the search resulted from running a search with a search query Pizza as shown. The user selects the car icon . As mentioned above the car icon is for showing one or more routes to the location that is represented by a pin with which the banner that includes the car icon is associated. The banner which includes the car icon also shows brief description of the place a star rating and an arrow for launching a stage for the POI.

The second stage illustrates the two routes route and route that the mapping application of some embodiments shows in response to the selection of the car icon in the previous stage . The user has selected route as indicated by highlighted banner . The user also selects the start control . As mentioned above the start control in some embodiments is for starting the navigation according to the selected route.

The third stage illustrates that the mapping application displays an instruction sign which is the sign for the first instruction. The mapping application has replaced the clear control and the start control with an end control and an overview control in the top bar . The end control is for ending the navigation of the route and the overview control is for showing the entire route in the map view by adjusting the zoom level of the displayed map if adjusting the zoom level is necessary to show the entire route. In some embodiments the mapping application displays in the top bar the estimated arrival time the amount of time to get to the destination and the remaining distance to the destination as shown.

When the mapping application receives a selection of the end control while the mapping application is operating in the route inspection mode the mapping application of some embodiments stops inspection of the selected route by going back to map browsing mode. The mapping application of some embodiments goes back to the map browsing mode by removing the selected route from the map putting back the page curl and replacing the information and controls in the top bar with a set of other controls including a direction control a search field and a bookmark control. That is the mapping application takes the appearance of the UI page back to a UI page similar to the UI page shown in the first stage . The mapping application of some embodiments does not shift the map to another region when switching to the map browsing mode from the inspection mode.

It should be noted that while neither the route history entries in the search field nor quick route navigation control perform actions that cannot be achieved with the selectable direction item they serve as important accelerators that make it much easier to obtain the most commonly desired routes.

Some embodiments use a cinematic transition from the 2D map view into the 3D map view or vice versa. For instance when the mapping application receives a selection of the 3D control while showing a starting location of a route the mapping application begins from the 2D map view and transitions smoothly from a first virtual camera view for the 2D map to a new virtual camera 3D view that is more zoomed in and pointing in the direction of the start of the route. In doing so the virtual camera map performs a combination of translation zoom and rotation operations in order to reach the start of the route for navigation. That is the virtual camera moves in an arc and rotates more upward as the camera moves downward along the arc. Also the mapping application may rotate the arc itself to align the virtual camera viewpoint to the initial road segment of the route. In other words the mapping application rotates the map during the cinematic transition.

The first stage illustrates a user selecting a quick route button for a location Pizza Place in order to generate a route from the user s current location near the center of the screen of device to the selected location. The second stage illustrates the mapping application displaying a route to reach the location Pizza Place. At the second stage the user selects the Start UI control . Accordingly the application begins entering navigation.

As shown at the third through sixth stages some embodiments use a cinematic transition from the 2D or 3D non immersive map view into the 3D immersive map view. The application display begins from its current state that shown at and transitions smoothly from the first virtual camera view to the new virtual camera view that is more zoomed in and pointing in the direction of the start of the route. In doing so the virtual camera may perform a combination of translation zoom and rotation operations in order to reach the start of the route for navigation. As shown in these stages the virtual camera moves and rotates into its eventual location behind the navigation location indicator i.e. the puck shown in the sixth stage .

When a user initially opens the mapping application the application is in state the map browsing state. In this state the application will have generated and displayed a map view. To generate and display this map view the application of some embodiments identifies a required set of map tiles for a region requests the map tiles e.g. from a mapping service server generates a view of the map tiles from a particular location orientation and perspective of a virtual camera and renders the map view to a device display. When in state the map view is static. With the application in state the user can perform numerous operations to modify the map view search for entities e.g. places of interest addresses etc. retrieve a route for navigation etc.

In some embodiments the integrated application is displayed on a device with an integrated touch sensitive display. Various gestural interactions over the map may cause the application to perform different modifications to the map view e.g. panning rotating zooming modifying the map perspective etc. . When the integrated application receives gestural interactions over the map display as opposed to touch inputs over various floating or non floating controls overlaid on the map display the application transitions to state to perform gestural input recognition.

The gestural input recognition state differentiates between different types of gestural input and translates these types of input into different map view modification operations. In some embodiments the mapping application receives the gestural input as translated by the operating system of the device with the integrated touch sensitive display. The operating system translates the touch input into gesture types and locations e.g. a tap at coordinates x y a pinch operation with separate touch inputs at two different locations etc. . At state the integrated mapping application of some embodiments translates these into the different map view modification operations.

When the application receives a first type of gestural input e.g. two separate touch inputs moving together in a rotational motion over the map view the application transitions to state to rotate the map. To rotate the map view some embodiments modify the location and or orientation of the virtual camera that determines which portion of the map is rendered to create the map view. When in 3D mode for example the mapping application rotates the virtual camera about a particular position e.g. the center of the touch inputs the center of the display a location indicator identifying the user s location etc. . As the first type of gestural input continues the mapping application remains in state to continue rotating the map.

When the user releases the first type of gestural input the application of some embodiments transitions to state to perform an inertia calculation. In some embodiments after the user releases certain types of touch inputs the application continues to perform the associated map view modification for a particular amount of time and or distance. In this case after the user releases the rotation input the application transitions to the inertia calculation state to calculate the additional rotation amount and the time over which this rotation should be performed. In some embodiments the application slows down the rotation from the angular velocity at which the map was being rotated as if a frictional force was applied to the map. As such the inertia calculation of some embodiments is based on the speed of the first type of gestural input. From state the application transitions back to the map modification state that the application was previously in. That is when the application transitions from state the rotation state to the inertia calculation state it then transitions back to state after performing the inertia calculation. After the rotation of the map is complete the application transitions back to state .

When the application receives a second type of gestural input e.g. a single touch input moving over the map view the application transitions to state to pan the map. To pan the map view some embodiments modify the location of the virtual camera that determines which portion of the map is rendered to create the map view. This causes the map to appear to slide in a direction derived from the direction of the second type of gestural input. In some embodiments when the map view is in a 3D perspective mode the panning process involves performing a correlation of the location of the touch input to a location on the flat map in order to avoid sudden unwanted jumps in the map view. As the second type of gestural input continues the mapping application remains in state to continue panning the map.

When the user releases the second type of gestural input the application of some embodiments transitions to state to perform an inertia calculation. In some embodiments after the user releases certain types of touch inputs the application continues to perform the associated map view modification for a particular amount of time and or distance. In this case after the user releases the panning input the application transitions to the inertia calculation state to calculate the additional amount to move the map view i.e. move the virtual camera and the time over which this movement should be performed. In some embodiments the application slows down the panning movement from the velocity at which the map was being panned as if a frictional force was applied to the map. As such the inertia calculation of some embodiments is based on the speed of the second type of gestural input. From state the application transitions back to the map modification state that the application was previously in. That is when the application transitions from state the panning state to the inertia calculation state it then transitions back to state after performing the inertia calculation. After the panning of the map is complete the application transitions back to state .

When the application receives a third type of gestural input e.g. two separate touch inputs moving closer together or further apart the application transitions to state to zoom in on or out of the map. To change the zoom level of the map view some embodiments modify the location i.e. height of the virtual camera that determines which portion of the map is rendered to create the map view. This causes the map view to include more if zooming out or less if zooming in of the map. In some embodiments as the user zooms in or out the application retrieves different map tiles for different zoom levels to generate and render the new map view. As the third type of gestural input continues the mapping application remains in state to continue zooming in on or out of the map.

When the user releases the second type of gestural input the application of some embodiments transitions to state to perform an inertia calculation. In some embodiments after the user releases certain types of touch inputs the application continues to perform the associated map view modification for a particular amount of time and or distance i.e. moving the virtual camera higher or lower . In this case after the user releases the zoom input the application transitions to the inertia calculation state to calculate the additional amount to zoom the map view i.e. move the virtual camera and the time over which this movement should be performed. In some embodiments the application slows down the zooming movement from the velocity at which the map was being zoomed in on or out of i.e. the speed at which the virtual camera changes height as if a frictional force was applied to the camera. As such the inertia calculation of some embodiments is based on the speed of the third type of gestural input. From state the application transitions back to the map modification state that the application was previously in. That is when the application transitions from state the zooming state to the inertia calculation state it then transitions back to state after performing the inertia calculation. After the zooming of the map is complete the application transitions back to state .

For simplicity the state diagram illustrates the map panning zooming and rotation processes using the same inertia calculation process state . However in some embodiments each of these different map modification processes actually uses a different inertia calculation to identify the slow down and stop for its particular type of movement. In addition some embodiments calculate and modify the inertia variables as the input is received rather than when the user removes the gestural input.

When the application receives a fourth type of gestural input e.g. two separate touch inputs moving up or down the touch sensitive display in unison the application transitions to state to modify the perspective view of the map. To change the perspective view of the map some embodiments move the virtual camera along an arc over the map modifying both the location and orientation of the virtual camera as the camera keeps the center of its field of view at a particular location on the map . In some embodiments different zoom levels use different arcs along which the virtual camera moves. Each of these arcs has a top point at which the virtual camera is pointing straight down giving a 2D perspective view of the map. In addition each arc has a bottom point that is the lowest point on the arc to which the virtual camera can be moved. Thus the fourth type of gestural input can cause the application to change between a 2D map view and a 3D perspective map view in some embodiments. As the fourth type of gestural input continues the mapping application remains in state to continue modifying the perspective view of the map.

When the user releases the fourth type of gestural input the application of some embodiments transitions to state to perform an inertia calculation. In some embodiments after the user releases certain types of touch inputs the application continues to perform the associated map view modification for a particular amount of time and or distance i.e. moving the virtual camera higher or lower . In this case after the user releases the perspective view change input the application transitions to the inertia calculation state to calculate the additional amount to modify the perspective of the map view i.e. move the virtual camera along its arc and the time over which this movement should be performed. In some embodiments the application slows down the movement from the velocity at which the map was changing perspective i.e. the speed at which the virtual camera moves along its arc as if a frictional force was applied to the camera. As such the inertia calculation of some embodiments is based on the speed with which the fourth type of gestural input was performed.

In addition for the perspective change operation some embodiments transition to a rebound calculation state . As stated the perspective change operation has a maximum and minimum perspective shift allowed in some embodiments which may depend on the zoom level of the current map view. Thus in addition to an inertia calculation the application performs a rebound calculation at state . The rebound calculation uses the inertia calculation to determine whether the maximum point along the virtual camera arc will be reached and if so the velocity of the virtual camera at this point. Some embodiments allow the virtual camera to move slightly past the maximum point to hit a rebound point at which point the application turns the virtual camera around on its arc moving it back toward the maximum point. Some embodiments include such a bounce back functionality only on one end of the virtual camera arc e.g. the bottom of the arc while other embodiments include the functionality on both ends of the arc. From the rebound calculation state the application transitions back to the inertia calculation state then back to the perspective changing state to display the map view movement. In addition when the user performs the fourth type of touch input for long enough and the perspective reaches its maximum point the application transitions directly from the state to state to calculate the rebound information and then transitions back to state . After the modification to the perspective view of the map is complete the application transitions back to state .

The above states relate to the various multi touch gestures over the map presentation that the integrated mapping search and navigation application translates into different modifications to the map presentation. Various other touch inputs can also cause the application to change states and perform various functions. For instance some embodiments overlay a 3D selectable item on the map view e.g. as a floating control and selecting e.g. with a tap input the 3D item causes the application to transition to to modify the perspective of the map view. When the map view starts in a 3D perspective view the application modifies the perspective into a 2D view when the map view starts in the 2D view the application modifies the perspective into a 3D view. After the modification the application returns to state .

When a user is viewing a map in state the application presents various labels as part of the map view. Some of these labels indicate places of interest or other locations. When a user selects certain labels e.g. for certain businesses parks etc. the application transitions to state to display a banner for the selected location e.g. an information display banner then returns to the map browsing state with the banner displayed over the map . In some embodiments this banner includes 1 a quick route navigation UI control e.g. a button that causes the application to retrieve a route e.g. a driving route from a current location of the device to the selected location without leaving the map view and 2 an information UI control e.g. button that causes the application to provide additional information about the location. When a user selects the UI control button the application transitions from state to state to display a staging area for the selected location. In some embodiments this staging area displays a media presentation of the selected location e.g. a 3D video presentation a flyover view of the selected location a series of images captured for the location etc. as well as various information for the selected location contact information reviews etc. . The application stays in the state as the user performs various operations to navigate the staging area and view information within the staging area. When a user selects a UI control to transfer back to the map view the application transitions to state .

From the map browsing view the user can also easily access the search function of the application. When a particular UI control e.g. a search bar is selected the application transitions to a search entry suggestion state . At the search entry state some embodiments display a touchscreen keyboard with which the user can enter a search term. The search term may be a business name an address a type of location e.g. coffee shops etc. While the user enters characters the application remains in state and provides suggestions based on recent searches the letters already entered etc. Some embodiments may use prefix based suggestions e.g. suggestions starting with the characters already entered as well as other suggestions e.g. making spelling corrections to add characters at the beginning of the already entered string transpose characters etc. . In some embodiments the selections may also include recently entered routes in addition to locations. If the user selects a cancellation UI control at this stage the application transfers back to state without performing a search.

When the user selects a search term either a suggested term or a term that is entered completely by the user the application transitions to state to display the search results over the map view then transitions to state with the search results displayed. Some embodiments display the search results as selectable items e.g. pins on the map selection of one of the items causes a transition to state to display the banner for the selected item. In addition the application of some embodiments automatically selects one of the search results e.g. a best result and displays this banner as part of the state .

As the application is a tightly integrated mapping search routing and navigation application the user can easily access the routing function from the map browsing state. When a particular UI control e.g. a route entry button is selected the application transitions to the route entry state . At the route entry state some embodiments display a touchscreen keyboard with which the user can enter locations e.g. addresses place names place types etc. into both to and from fields in order to request a route. While the user enters characters the application remains in state and provides suggestions based on recent routes recent searches an autocomplete similar to that described for the search entry etc. If the user selects a cancellation UI control at this stage the application transfers back to state without retrieving a route.

When the user selects a route e.g. by entering a to location and a from location the application transitions to the route displaying state . At this state the application displays one or more routes from a first selected location to a second selected location over the map view e.g. by overlaying route lines on the map view . Some embodiments automatically select a first one of the routes. The user can select any of the other routes e.g. by tapping over the unselected route with the application remaining in state but modifying the display of the route lines to indicate the selection of the other route . In addition when in state the application of some embodiments displays different UI controls related to routing and navigation including a direction list control a navigation start control and others.

Also various gestural interactions over the map on which the routes are displayed may cause the application to perform different modifications to the map view e.g. panning rotating zooming modifying the map perspective etc. . When the integrated application receives gestural interaction over the map display while in the route display state the application transitions to state to perform gestural input recognition with all of the gestural map modification operations e.g. corollaries to states available. That is the application translates the gestural input into panning rotation zoom and or perspective change operations similar to those described above for states with similar inertia and rebound features for the virtual camera movement. Whereas the operations return to the map browsing state the corollary operations accessed from the route display state return to the route display state .

In some embodiments the route display state is accessible from other states as well. For instance if a user selects the quick route UI control on a banner while in state the application retrieves one or more routes from the current location of the device to the location with which the banner is associated. In addition some embodiments display previously requested routes among the search suggestions at state . When the user selects one of these suggested routes the application transitions directly from state to state to display one or more routes over the map.

From the route display state the application can transition into various different modes depending on different controls selected by the user. When the user selects a UI control to clear the routes the application transitions back to state to display the map without any routes. In addition the integrated application may enter one or more navigation modalities from the route displaying state .

When the selected route displayed at state starts at the current location of the device and the user selects a navigation starting control the application transitions to the navigation state . In some embodiments the application displays a cinematic transition from the map view into a more immersive 3D view for navigation. Within the navigation state of some embodiments a virtual camera follows the location of the user along the selected route in order to present the upcoming portions of the route. When either the route is completed the device reaches the destination location or the user selects a control to end navigation the application transitions to state to present the map browsing view .

In some embodiments various gestural interactions over the map on which the routes are displayed may cause the application to perform different modifications to the map view e.g. panning rotating zooming modifying the map perspective etc. while in the navigation mode . In some embodiments only some of the described map modification operations are available in the navigation mode. For instance some embodiments allow the user to zoom in or out but do not allow any other modifications to the map. Thus when the user provides gestural input the gestural input recognition state filters out types of gestural input not associated with the zoom operation and subsequently the application returns to state . When the type of gestural input associated with the zoom operation is received the gestural input recognition state recognizes this input and the application transitions to a state similar to state for changing the zoom level of the map with the inertia calculation in some embodiments .

Other embodiments may enable different map modification operations. For instance in some embodiments all of the gestural map modification operations e.g. corollaries to states are available while in the navigation mode. Some embodiments allow a subset of the gestural map modification operations such as zooming and a limited panning operation. The panning operation of some embodiments upon receiving the type of gestural input associated with panning moves the virtual camera while in the navigation mode to the side then returns the virtual camera back to pointing along the route. Whereas the operations return to the map browsing state the corollary operations accessed from the navigation state return to the navigation state .

When the selected route displayed at state starts at a location other than the current location of the device or the route is a walking route and the user selects a navigation starting control the application transitions to the stepping mode or route inspection mode at state . In some embodiments the application displays the maneuvers performed along the route one at a time e.g. as navigation signs . By providing gestural input e.g. swipe gestures to the maneuvers the user can view the different maneuvers while in the route inspection mode. The maneuvers are overlaid on a map and at least a portion of the route is displayed in the map.

As in the route display mode various gestural interactions over the map may cause the application to perform different modifications to the map view e.g. panning rotating zooming modifying the map perspective etc. . When the integrated application receives gestural interaction over the map display while in the stepping mode the application transitions to state to perform gestural input recognition with all of the gestural map modification operations e.g. corollaries to states available. That is the application translates the gestural input into panning rotation zoom and or perspective change operations similar to those described above for states with similar inertia and rebound features for the virtual camera movement. Whereas the operations return to the map browsing state the corollary operations accessed from the stepping mode return to the stepping mode .

Furthermore in some embodiments the gestural input recognition recognizes at least one type of gestural input over the displayed maneuvers in order to switch between the maneuvers. When a particular type of gestural input e.g. a swipe gesture is received over the displayed maneuver as opposed to over the map view the application transitions to a state not shown for changing the displayed maneuver then returns to state .

When the integrated application receives gestural interaction over the map displayed while in the stepping state the application transitions to state to perform gestural input recognition with all of the gestural map modification operations e.g. corollaries to states available. When the modification operations are done the application returns to state . When the user selects a control to end stepping through the maneuvers the application transitions to state to present the map browsing view.

In addition in some embodiments the application can transition from the stepping mode to an auto stepping state . When the user selects a location tracking control while the application is in state the application transitions to an automatic stepping mode which is a different navigation modality. When in the automatic stepping mode of some embodiments the integrated mapping search and navigation application displays the maneuver to which the device s location is closest e.g. as measured by a juncture at which the maneuver is performed . When the device moves e.g. along the route to a location closer to a different maneuver the auto stepping mode automatically displays the different maneuver. When the user deselects the location tracking control the application transitions back to the stepping mode . When the user selects a control to end navigation while in the auto stepping state the application transitions to state to present the map browsing view.

As in the stepping mode various gestural interactions over the map may cause the application to perform different modifications to the map view e.g. panning rotating zooming modifying the map perspective etc. . When the integrated application receives gestural interaction over the map display while in the auto stepping mode the application transitions to state to perform gestural input recognition with all of the gestural map modification operations e.g. corollaries to states available. That is the application translates the gestural input into panning rotation zoom and or perspective change operations similar to those described above for states with similar inertia and rebound features for the virtual camera movement. Whereas the operations return to the map browsing state the corollary operations accessed from the auto stepping mode return to the auto stepping mode . In addition some embodiments automatically turn the location tracking control off when the user pans the map a particular distance in which case the application returns to the stepping mode state rather than auto stepping state .

Various embodiments may operate within a map service operating environment. illustrates a map service operating environment according to some embodiments. A map service also referred to as mapping service may provide map services for one or more client devices in communication with the map service through various communication methods and protocols. A map service in some embodiments provides map information and other map related data such as two dimensional map image data e.g. aerial view of roads utilizing satellite imagery three dimensional map image data e.g. traversable map with three dimensional features such as buildings route and direction calculations e.g. ferry route calculations or directions between two points for a pedestrian real time navigation data e.g. turn by turn visual navigation data in two or three dimensions location data e.g. where the client device currently is located and other geographic data e.g. wireless network coverage weather traffic information or nearby points of interest . In various embodiments the map service data may include localized labels for different countries or regions. Localized labels may be utilized to present map labels e.g. street names city names points of interest in different languages on client devices. Client devices may utilize these map services by obtaining map service data. Client devices may implement various techniques to process map service data. Client devices may then provide map services to various entities including but not limited to users internal software or hardware modules and or other systems or devices external to the client devices 

In some embodiments a map service is implemented by one or more nodes in a distributed computing system. Each node may be assigned one or more services or components of a map service. Some nodes may be assigned the same map service or component of a map service. A load balancing node in some embodiments distributes access or requests to other nodes within a map service. In some embodiments a map service is implemented as a single system such as a single server. Different modules or hardware devices within a server may implement one or more of the various services provided by a map service.

A map service in some embodiments provides map services by generating map service data in various formats. In some embodiments one format of map service data is map image data. Map image data provides image data to a client device so that the client device may process the image data e.g. rendering and or displaying the image data as a two dimensional or three dimensional map . Map image data whether in two or three dimensions may specify one or more map tiles. A map tile may be a portion of a larger map image. Assembling together the map tiles of a map produces the original map. Tiles may be generated from map image data routing or navigation data or any other map service data. In some embodiments map tiles are raster based map tiles with tile sizes ranging from any size both larger and smaller than a commonly used 256 pixel by 256 pixel tile. Raster based map tiles may be encoded in any number of standard digital image representations including but not limited to Bitmap .bmp Graphics Interchange Format .gif Joint Photographic Experts Group .jpg .jpeg etc. Portable Networks Graphic .png or Tagged Image File Format .tiff . In some embodiments map tiles are vector based map tiles encoded using vector graphics including but not limited to Scalable Vector Graphics .svg or a Drawing File .drw . Some embodiments also include tiles with a combination of vector and raster data. Metadata or other information pertaining to the map tile may also be included within or along with a map tile providing further map service data to a client device. In various embodiments a map tile is encoded for transport utilizing various standards and or protocols some of which are described in examples below.

In various embodiments map tiles may be constructed from image data of different resolutions depending on zoom level. For instance for low zoom level e.g. world or globe view the resolution of map or image data need not be as high relative to the resolution at a high zoom level e.g. city or street level . For example when in a globe view there may be no need to render street level artifacts as such objects would be so small as to be negligible in many cases.

A map service in some embodiments performs various techniques to analyze a map tile before encoding the tile for transport. This analysis may optimize map service performance for both client devices and a map service. In some embodiments map tiles are analyzed for complexity according to vector based graphic techniques and constructed utilizing complex and non complex layers. Map tiles may also be analyzed for common image data or patterns that may be rendered as image textures and constructed by relying on image masks. In some embodiments raster based image data in a map tile contains certain mask values which are associated with one or more textures. Some embodiments also analyze map tiles for specified features that may be associated with certain map styles that contain style identifiers.

Other map services generate map service data relying upon various data formats separate from a map tile in some embodiments. For instance map services that provide location data may utilize data formats conforming to location service protocols such as but not limited to Radio Resource Location services Protocol RRLP TIA for Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Radio Resource Control RRC position protocol or LTE Positioning Protocol LPP . Embodiments may also receive or request data from client devices identifying device capabilities or attributes e.g. hardware specifications or operating system version or communication capabilities e.g. device communication bandwidth as determined by wireless signal strength or wired or wireless network type .

A map service may obtain map service data from internal or external sources. For example satellite imagery used in map image data may be obtained from external services or internal systems storage devices or nodes. Other examples may include but are not limited to GPS assistance servers wireless network coverage databases business or personal directories weather data government information e.g. construction updates or road name changes or traffic reports. Some embodiments of a map service may update map service data e.g. wireless network coverage for analyzing future requests from client devices.

Various embodiments of a map service respond to client device requests for map services. These requests may be a request for a specific map or portion of a map. Some embodiments format requests for a map as requests for certain map tiles. In some embodiments requests also supply the map service with starting locations or current locations and destination locations for a route calculation. A client device may also request map service rendering information such as map textures or style sheets. In at least some embodiments requests are also one of a series of requests implementing turn by turn navigation. Requests for other geographic data may include but are not limited to current location wireless network coverage weather traffic information or nearby points of interest.

A map service in some embodiments analyzes client device requests to optimize a device or map service operation. For instance a map service may recognize that the location of a client device is in an area of poor communications e.g. weak wireless signal and send more map service data to supply a client device in the event of loss in communication or send instructions to utilize different client hardware e.g. orientation sensors or software e.g. utilize wireless location services or Wi Fi positioning instead of GPS based services . In another example a map service may analyze a client device request for vector based map image data and determine that raster based map data better optimizes the map image data according to the image s complexity. Embodiments of other map services may perform similar analysis on client device requests and as such the above examples are not intended to be limiting.

Various embodiments of client devices e.g. client devices are implemented on different portable multifunction device types. Client devices utilize map service through various communication methods and protocols. In some embodiments client devices obtain map service data from map service . Client devices request or receive map service data. Client devices then process map service data e.g. render and or display the data and may send the data to another software or hardware module on the device or to an external device or system.

A client device according to some embodiments implements techniques to render and or display maps. These maps may be requested or received in various formats such as map tiles described above. A client device may render a map in two dimensional or three dimensional views. Some embodiments of a client device display a rendered map and allow a user system or device providing input to manipulate a virtual camera in the map changing the map display according to the virtual camera s position orientation and field of view. Various forms and input devices are implemented to manipulate a virtual camera. In some embodiments touch input through certain single or combination gestures e.g. touch and hold or a swipe manipulate the virtual camera. Other embodiments allow manipulation of the device s physical location to manipulate a virtual camera. For instance a client device may be tilted up from its current position to manipulate the virtual camera to rotate up. In another example a client device may be tilted forward from its current position to move the virtual camera forward. Other input devices to the client device may be implemented including but not limited to auditory input e.g. spoken words a physical keyboard mouse and or a joystick.

Some embodiments provide various visual feedback to virtual camera manipulations such as displaying an animation of possible virtual camera manipulations when transitioning from two dimensional map views to three dimensional map views. Some embodiments also allow input to select a map feature or object e.g. a building and highlight the object producing a blur effect that maintains the virtual camera s perception of three dimensional space.

In some embodiments a client device implements a navigation system e.g. turn by turn navigation . A navigation system provides directions or route information which may be displayed to a user. Some embodiments of a client device request directions or a route calculation from a map service. A client device may receive map image data and route data from a map service. In some embodiments a client device implements a turn by turn navigation system which provides real time route and direction information based upon location information and route information received from a map service and or other location system such as a Global Positioning Satellite GPS system. A client device may display map image data that reflects the current location of the client device and update the map image data in real time. A navigation system may provide auditory or visual directions to follow a certain route.

A virtual camera is implemented to manipulate navigation map data according to some embodiments. Some embodiments of client devices allow the device to adjust the virtual camera display orientation to bias toward the route destination. Some embodiments also allow the virtual camera to navigation turns simulating the inertial motion of the virtual camera.

Client devices implement various techniques to utilize map service data from map service. Some embodiments implement some techniques to optimize rendering of two dimensional and three dimensional map image data. In some embodiments a client device locally stores rendering information. For instance a client stores a style sheet which provides rendering directions for image data containing style identifiers. In another example common image textures may be stored to decrease the amount of map image data transferred from a map service. Client devices in different embodiments implement various modeling techniques to render two dimensional and three dimensional map image data examples of which include but are not limited to generating three dimensional buildings out of two dimensional building footprint data modeling two dimensional and three dimensional map objects to determine the client device communication environment generating models to determine whether map labels are seen from a certain virtual camera position and generating models to smooth transitions between map image data. In some embodiments the client devices also order or prioritize map service data in certain techniques. For instance a client device detects the motion or velocity of a virtual camera which if exceeding certain threshold values lower detail image data is loaded and rendered for certain areas. Other examples include rendering vector based curves as a series of points preloading map image data for areas of poor communication with a map service adapting textures based on display zoom level or rendering map image data according to complexity.

In some embodiments client devices communicate utilizing various data formats separate from a map tile. For instance some client devices implement Assisted Global Positioning Satellites A GPS and communicate with location services that utilize data formats conforming to location service protocols such as but not limited to Radio Resource Location services Protocol RRLP TIA for Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Radio Resource Control RRC position protocol or LTE Positioning Protocol LPP . Client devices may also receive GPS signals directly. Embodiments may also send data with or without solicitation from a map service identifying the client device s capabilities or attributes e.g. hardware specifications or operating system version or communication capabilities e.g. device communication bandwidth as determined by wireless signal strength or wired or wireless network type .

In some embodiments both voice and data communications are established over wireless network and access device . For instance device can place and receive phone calls e.g. using voice over Internet Protocol VoIP protocols send and receive e mail messages e.g. using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP or Post Office Protocol 3 POP3 and retrieve electronic documents and or streams such as web pages photographs and videos over wireless network gateway and WAN e.g. using Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP or User Datagram Protocol UDP . Likewise in some implementations devices and can place and receive phone calls send and receive e mail messages and retrieve electronic documents over access device and WAN . In various embodiments any of the illustrated client devices may communicate with map service and or other service s using a persistent connection established in accordance with one or more security protocols such as the Secure Sockets Layer SSL protocol or the Transport Layer Security TLS protocol.

Likewise devices and can establish peer to peer communications e.g. a personal area network by use of one or more communication subsystems such as Bluetooth communication from Bluetooth Special Interest Group Inc. of Kirkland Wash. Device can also establish peer to peer communications with devices or not shown . Other communication protocols and topologies can also be implemented. Devices and may also receive Global Positioning Satellite GPS signals from GPS satellites .

In various embodiments map service and or other service s are configured to process search requests from any of the client devices. Search requests may include but are not limited to queries for businesses addresses residential locations points of interest or some combination thereof. Map service and or other service s may be configured to return results related to a variety of parameters including but not limited to a location entered into an address bar or other text entry field including abbreviations and or other shorthand notation a current map view e.g. user may be viewing one location on the multifunction device while residing in another location current location of the user e.g. in cases where the current map view did not include search results and the current route if any . In various embodiments these parameters may affect the composition of the search results and or the ordering of the search results based on different priority weightings. In various embodiments the search results that are returned may be a subset of results selected based on specific criteria including but not limited to a quantity of times the search result e.g. a particular point of interest has been requested a measure of quality associated with the search result e.g. highest user or editorial review rating and or the volume of reviews for the search results e.g. the number of times the search result has been review or rated .

In various embodiments map service and or other service s are configured to provide auto complete search results that are displayed on the client device such as within the mapping application. For instance auto complete search results may populate a portion of the screen as the user enters one or more search keywords on the multifunction device. In some cases this feature may save the user time as the desired search result may be displayed before the user enters the full search query. In various embodiments the auto complete search results may be search results found by the client on the client device e.g. bookmarks or contacts search results found elsewhere e.g. from the Internet by map service and or other service s and or some combination thereof. As is the case with commands any of the search queries may be entered by the user via voice or through typing. The multifunction device may be configured to display search results graphically within any of the map display described herein. For instance a pin or other graphical indicator may specify locations of search results as points of interest. In various embodiments responsive to a user selection of one of these points of interest e.g. a touch selection such as a tap the multifunction device is configured to display additional information about the selected point of interest including but not limited to ratings reviews or review snippets hours of operation store status e.g. open for business permanently closed etc. and or images of a storefront for the point of interest. In various embodiments any of this information may be displayed on a graphical information card that is displayed in response to the user s selection of the point of interest.

In various embodiments map service and or other service s provide one or more feedback mechanisms to receive feedback from client devices . For instance client devices may provide feedback on search results to map service and or other service s e.g. feedback specifying ratings reviews temporary or permanent business closures errors etc. this feedback may be used to update information about points of interest in order to provide more accurate or more up to date search results in the future. In some embodiments map service and or other service s may provide testing information to the client device e.g. an A B test to determine which search results are best. For instance at random intervals the client device may receive and present two search results to a user and allow the user to indicate the best result. The client device may report the test results to map service and or other service s to improve future search results based on the chosen testing technique such as an A B test technique in which a baseline control sample is compared to a variety of single variable test samples in order to improve results.

While the invention has been described with reference to numerous specific details one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the invention. For instance many of the figures illustrate various touch gestures e.g. taps double taps swipe gestures press and hold gestures etc. . However many of the illustrated operations could be performed via different touch gestures e.g. a swipe instead of a tap etc. or by non touch input e.g. using a cursor controller a keyboard a touchpad trackpad a near touch sensitive screen etc. . In addition a number of the figures conceptually illustrate processes. The specific operations of these processes may not be performed in the exact order shown and described. The specific operations may not be performed in one continuous series of operations and different specific operations may be performed in different embodiments. Furthermore the process could be implemented using several sub processes or as part of a larger macro process.
