The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 156 091 filed May 28 2008 which claims the priority benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 60 932 712 filed May 31 2007 titled Systems and Methods for Auction Based Polling which are each hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates generally to social networking and more particularly to systems and methods for auction based polling.

Conventionally survey firms provide various conduits for companies to survey individuals in a public or private arena. With the popularity of the Internet and online venues these survey firms often survey individuals via the Internet. A company or individual can pay the survey firms to survey these individuals groups and so forth using a variety of media outlets available online.

Typically the survey firm accrues results from polls taken on behalf of the company or the individual and provides the results to the company or the individual. The results may be provided based on information input by the company or the individual or according to any other criteria. The survey firm may also provide demographic data about the users that participated in the polls.

However the company or the individual that requested the poll sometimes desires faster and event nearly immediate results. In addition a lengthy typically offline registration process with the survey firm is often involved for scheduling the polls. Further the survey firm rather than a poll requester frequently specifies a price for the poll.

The present invention provides a system and method for auction based polling. Parameters related to a poll are received from a first user. A query is associated with the poll. A priority of the poll is determined based on the parameters. The poll is distributed to one or more second users according to the priority. Results to the poll are gathered. The results are reported to the first user.

The users may access the polling engine via a computing device such as a laptop or desktop computer a cellular telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a set top box and so forth. The users may view data about social network members enter data about the users themselves join social network groups and so forth via the polling engine . The users are typically members of a social networking website associated with the polling engine for example and thus comprise the social network members themselves. However any of the users or other individuals not associated with the polling engine can conduct a poll or survey of the members of the social networking website by interfacing with an application programming interface API associated with the polling engine . For example the users that are non members of the social networking website may conduct polls of the users that are members of the social networking website and the users that are members of the social networking website may also conduct polls of the users that are also members of the same social networking website.

In other embodiments the users can access the polling engine via an advertising engine not shown that serves advertisements to various users. Any type of website network and so forth may connect the users with the polling engine .

The users such as the users A A through users N N may generate polls utilizing the polling engine . According to some embodiments a user accesses the polling engine via the API such as via a website hosted by the polling engine . The user enters data into the API such as desired questions for conducting a poll survey or any other type of query of the users associated with the polling engine . The API may be provided specifically for queries or polls or in alternative embodiments for various other interactions with the polling engine as well.

The user accessing the API can also enter auction data. For example the user i.e. the poll requester can specify a price per answer the user is willing to pay for answers to the survey poll or query. The polling engine can rank the poll from the poll requester against other requested polls according to the price per answer and fulfill the polls according to the bids i.e. the price per answer . In some embodiments a hierarchy may be assigned to the polls according to the bids. Alternatively some polls may not be fulfilled according to the bids.

In some embodiments the poll requester can more specifically bid the price per answer for varying categories or groups of the users associated with the polling engine . For example the price per answer for computer science majors from MIT may be higher than the price per answer for computer science majors from Harvard. Any type of grouping or categories for potential survey recipients is possible. The poll requester may specify the categories or the polling engine may suggest categories. The categories associated with the users may be selected from a drop down menu or other menu offering predetermined categories of the users or by any other means known in the art.

Various methods of providing poll details to the polling engine may be employed. The poll requester may enter a poll question and response choices fir example via a web page. Alternatively the polling engine may provide the API for users to write programs and generate polls themselves to automatically base decisions on poll results and or generate new polls based on the results of one or more previous polls.

The poll requester may also be able to enter data regarding what the poll requester is willing to pay to conduct the poll via the API thus creating an auction like process. For example the poll requester can specify a bid per answer a bid per user and or a bid per impression that the poll requester is willing to pay. The bid per user may include a price per grouping or type of user such as users from a particular geographical location or school. The bid per impression may include a price per instant the poll appears to the users or a group of the users .

The bid may be based on profiles associated with the users . As discussed herein the users that are members of the social networking website may be polled by other members and or by the users that are non members. For example the poll requester may bid a dollar 1.00 for answers by the users who indicate in a profile that the users favorite food is pizza. Bid types may be combined according to some embodiments. For example the poll requester may bid one dollar 1.00 for each answer and another one dollar 1.00 for each impression related to the users that attend Stanford University. Any type of combination of bidding methods is within the scope of the present invention.

The polling engine can rank all polls requested according to the price per answer or impression and fulfill the polls according to the bids i.e. the higher priced polls first . Priority may alternatively be based on total cost regardless of the number of requested users. Any type of hierarchy or priority may be calculated utilizing any data available to the polling engine .

According to some embodiments the polling engine can determine a predicted response rate to the poll. The predicted response rate may be utilized by the polling engine to select the polls that win an auction. For example a poll with a high predicted response rate may be more desirable because the poll may generate more revenue than a poll that is predicted to have a low response rate.

Referring now to a block diagram of an exemplary polling engine such as the polling engine discussed in is illustrated. A communications interface is provided for receiving data from the users such as poll requesters or other users and sending data to the users . As discussed herein the users that comprise poll requesters may further comprise members of the social networking website or non members of the social networking website. The communications interface may be utilized for sending polls or other queries to the users and gathering responses from the users .

Typically the users may access a website associated with the polling engine . For example the polling engine can host the social networking website which the users can visit to interact with one another. The website can display various types of data about the users to one another such as profile information relationships between users poll results and other information. The users may belong to particular communities within the social networking website such as communities categorized according to school attended workplace geographical location etc. The communities may be utilized by the polling engine for grouping or categorizing the users . As discussed herein different bids may be provided by a poll requester for the different communities comprised of the users .

A parameter module is provided for receiving parameters associated with a requested poll via the API . The poll requester inputs various desired parameters such as a price per answer price per impression price per type of user questions for the poll and so forth.

An auction module is provided for evaluating the bids entered by the poll requester. The auction module can compare the various parameters input to determine a hierarchy for fulfilling the polls from each of the poll requesters. The auction module may fulfill polls in an order based on the bid per answer the bid per impression the bid per type of user a combination of types of bids and so forth.

The total amount of each bid may also be considered. For example a user X may bid ten dollars 10.00 per answer for a maximum of 100 answers while a user Y bids five dollars 5.00 per answer for a maximum of 300 answers. The auction module may then rank user Y s bid as higher because the net bid is higher than user X s bid i.e. 1500 net rather than 1000 . Any type of ranking system may be employed by the auction module . For example the polls may be ranked according to price difficulty of gathering responses or fulfilling the poll originality of poll and so forth. Further as discussed herein different bids for different type of users responding to the poll may be entered.

A query module conducts the polls by sending out queries to the users and gathering responses from the users . The query module may fulfill the polls in an order specified by the auction module .

If desired the query module may suggest follow up or alternative poll related queries to the poll requester. For example based on responses from the users to the polling queries the polling module may suggest other poll categories or subject matter in which the users may be interested. The query module may also suggest alternative language for posing poll related queries to the users based on information about the users such as previous polling responses user profile data and so forth.

A reporting module utilizes the polling responses gathered by the query module to generate a report for the poll requester. The reporting module may access profile data for the users that responded to the poll to generate the report and or any other type of data. The report may include demographics about the users that responded for example.

A profile database that includes information about the users may need to be accessed by the reporting module and or the query module according to some embodiments. For example the profile database may be utilized in order to access and provide demographic information about the users to help the query module determine which of the users should receive a query and so forth. Access to data about the users or to the users directly may be restricted by the polling engine . Thus the polling engine may provide only certain demographic data to the poll requester about the users that respond to polls.

The poll may be sent to specific users or the poll may be posted on a social networking website associated with the polling engine . If the poll is posted rather than sent the users that respond to the poll may need to be compared with profile data to determine if the users meet the parameters specified by the poll requester such as female MIT students. For example the parameter module may ignore responses from the users identified through profile information as graduates of Harvard if the poll requested that only students from MIT respond to a posted poll.

Although shows various modules associated with the polling engine e.g. the communications interface the parameter module the auction module the query module the reporting module and the profile database fewer or more modules may be associated with the polling engine and still fall within the scope of various embodiments. For example a polling database not shown may be coupled to the polling engine for storing data about poll responses received from the users .

Referring now to an illustration of an exemplary poll creation screen is shown. As discussed herein users can access the poll creation screen through any type of interface. The upcoming election poll appears on the screen once completed by the poll requester. The poll requester can enter a query or any other text in a query box . An answer style is then selected indicating what type of answers the users answering the upcoming election poll can input. The poll requester may allow the users being polled to answer in a yes no format an agree disagree format a custom format such as a text input or any other desired format.

One or more answer choices for the poll may also be input by the user as shown on the poll creation screen . For example as shown in five multiple choice answers are provided from which the users being polled may choose. One of those multiple choices allows for a write in selection. In other words the users being polled may select from a predetermined multiple choice answer or write in an answer.

The poll requester can further select one or more targets for desired respondents by indicating an age range and or sex associated with the polled users. The age range may be predetermined and selected from a drop down menu or the poll requester may specify a custom age range one or more specific ages and so forth. According to some embodiments the poll requester can identify keywords or profile types that the poll requester wishes to target with the poll being requested.

The poll requester can also select a location to associate with the poll . For example the poll related to the upcoming election in the screen shown in is associated with all locations. However if the poll related to a local upcoming election a local city may be selected. Any location related to any poll topic may be selected or otherwise provided by the requester.

A number of desired responses may be selected or input by the poll requester. The number of responses can identify the maximum number of the responses needed. A minimum number of responses or a range of acceptable responses may also be selected according to some embodiments. The poll requester may identify a number of responses required for a group of polls and allocate an ideal number of responses for each poll within the group of polls. Groups of polls may be distinct from one another or related. For example the users that select Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election poll may also be queried regarding campaign funding in a related poll while favorite cereal types may be queried in a different poll. Any group of polls may be requested related to any common area or range of subject matter.

A duration of the poll may also be selected according to some embodiments. The duration may be specified by the polling engine or may be requested by the poll requester and may be in terms of real time number of responses or a combination. For example the polling engine may indicate that it is likely to take four hours to complete a poll for which a maximum of 400 answers is desired by the poll requester. In another example the poll requester may request completion of the poll within 3 hours or any other increment of time. The polling engine may estimate the amount of time it takes to gather the answers based on previous polls for example. The duration of the poll may be correlated with bid prices so that polls with higher bids receive faster results. Any method for estimating the amount of time needed to gather answers to a poll is within the scope of various embodiments.

As discussed herein a bid price for each of the responses a bid per user and or a bid per impression may also be selected or bid by the poll requester. The price for each response each of the users and or each impression may be multiplied by the number of responses desired for a total bid price. As discussed herein any of these numbers may then be utilized by the polling engine to determine which polls requested are fulfilled. The requested polls may be fulfilled in a hierarchical order according to the bid price such as in an auction using either a per user price or the total price. According to some embodiments only the poll with the highest bid price is fulfilled within a certain period of time such as every hour or every day. Polls with lower bids may thus take longer to fulfill than the polls with higher bids. However other criteria such as subject matter affiliation with the network and so forth may also be utilized to decide when to fulfill one or more polls in addition to the auction of the bids per answer per user per impression etc. For example an advertiser that often advertises with a particular website may have the advertiser s polls prioritized based on affiliation with the particular website and or a high price bid per impression or a price for each impression to targeted users.

According to some embodiments the poll may be prioritized based on a combination of the level of a bid and the expected time for performance of the poll. Thus a poll that the polling engine expects will receive the maximum number of responses easily may be ranked higher due to the ability to easily fulfill the poll while a poll in which the maximum number of responses will be difficult or more time consuming to obtain may be ranked lower due to the difficulty of fulfilling the poll. As discussed herein any criteria may be utilized to rank or prioritize various polls.

After the poll requester completes the order and bid for the poll the poll requester can select a finish and pay button or any other mechanism for submitting the order. Although the poll creation screen illustrates various options for providing a poll query answers to the poll query target audience location and bids less or more information may be provided via the poll creation screen and still fall within the scope of various embodiments.

According to some embodiments a bid for the poll may be declined. For example a poll associated with a higher bidder may be chosen by the polling engine over a lower bidder for the same or similar poll. A screen may be displayed that indicates to the poll requester that the poll request cannot be fulfilled the poll request is declined or any other desired message. Any type of process display etc. for accepting or declining poll order requests is within the scope of various embodiments.

If the poll requester wishes edit the details of the poll the poll requester may return to the poll creation screen from the order confirmation screen to edit the details of the poll . Any other mechanism for editing the poll such as a pop up window may alternatively be provided.

Payment information may also be provided via the order confirmation screen . Although the order confirmation screen in indicates that the poll will go live immediately when the place order button is selected the poll may be posted or fulfilled in any manner or according to any timeline according to various embodiments.

As discussed herein the poll requester may indicate groups of users to which the poll should be sent or targeted. Although indicates that the users may be selected for targeting according to age and sex any other parameters may be selected for targeting polls. For example profile characteristics of the users or participation in other types of polls may be utilized to target a current poll.

At step an indication of a desired population to provide answers to the poll is received such as the targets discussed in . The targets may include school type age sex network and so forth.

At step the polling engine receives a bid amount that the poll requester is willing to pay. The poll requester may be willing to pay per user per impression and so forth as discussed herein.

At step the polling engine specifies the bill total for the poll requester based upon the bid amount. As discussed herein the bid may vary for different bid types. The poll requester may specify different bids for different user types answering the same poll. The polling engine may fulfill and or prioritize the poll based on the various bid types. For example different types of impressions users and so forth may be bid differently by the poll requester. As discussed herein MIT students that provide answers may be paid for at a higher rate than Harvard students. Similarly the price per answer when the poll is accessed from a central social networking page associated with a social networking website may be higher than when the poll is accessed via an advertisement associated with the social networking website. Any type of bids based on any type of data grouping and so forth may be entered by the poll requester or provided as a selection by the polling engine .

At step the billing information is received. At step the poll is prioritized and fulfilled. The results of the poll are then reported in real time to the poll requester at step . According to some embodiments the results of the poll may be reported to other users such as users that recently answered the poll question users visiting a screen on which the poll question is displayed for answer and so forth. The poll requester and or the polling engine can determine which users can access the poll results according to some embodiments. Although step indicates that the poll results are reported in real time the poll results may be reported to the poll requester or any other users at any point in time according to other embodiments.

Also discussed herein the first user may comprise a member of the social network or any other user. The first user may request the poll via the poll creation screen as shown in . The poll creation screen may be accessed via any interface as discussed herein.

At step a query is associated with the poll. The poll requester may associate one or more queries with the poll as shown in . In some embodiments the polling engine may automatically generate one or more queries according to subject matter provided by the poll requester. Alternatively the poll requester can select one or more queries from a drop down menu and the polling engine can incorporate the subject matter into the query selected. For example the poll requester can enter music artists for answer choices and a query category labeled favorite music artists from a drop down menu. The polling engine can then generate a query that asks users which of the below music artists is your favorite new artist Any type of query may be generated based on information provided by the poll requester.

At step a priority of the poll is determined based on the parameters. A poll may be fulfilled before another poll or conducted instead of another poll based on the parameters. For example the polling engine may gather and return results to the requester with the highest bid per answer before other poll results are returned to other requesters.

The priority of a poll may change depending upon the particular poll and the parameters. For example based on parameters including response rates to the particular poll the priority of the particular poll may change as it is conducted by the polling engine. Priority may also be calculated on a per user basis as discussed herein such as when the polling engine determines that certain users are more likely to respond to some polls.

At step the poll is then sent to one or more second users such as the users associated with a social networking website according to the priority. The first user may comprise the poll requester as discussed herein that belongs to a network in common with the one or more second users or the first user may not be associated with the network. In other words any user can request a poll whether or not the user is associated with the one or more second users via a common network a common website and so forth.

An incentive may be provided to the users for answering the one or more queries associated with the poll. For example the users may receive points coupons and so forth for answering the queries associated with the poll. The queries associated with the poll may be nested according to some embodiments. In other words if the user selects choice 3 the user may be asked another query related to the choice 3. For example in if the user selects Hillary Clinton the user may be presented with a follow up question about party affiliation. Any type of nested queries may be presented.

The poll may be sent to individual users such as via email or posted or displayed to profile pages associated with each of the individual users and or the one or more queries may be displayed to a common area associated with a website. When the queries are displayed in a common area the polling engine may compare the users that answer the poll with a profile associated with each of the users when a specific type of user is desired. For example if the poll indicates that only blue eyed users should answer the polling engine may compare the users that answer the poll with their profiles to ensure that they have blue eyes and disregard answers from other users. In other embodiments the polling engine may indicate to the users a group that is desired to answer the poll and may either prevent other users from answering the poll at all or not register the users answers.

According to other embodiments the users to which the poll is distributed may be balanced based on an automated sample balancing so that the users are representative of a population of users being sampled.

At step results to the poll may then be gathered. As discussed herein the results may be gathered over any period of time. The results may be gathered according to a winner of the auction or according to any other criteria as discussed herein.

At step the results are then reported to the first user such as the poll requester. The results may be categorized according to demographics target audience answer types and so forth. Any data may be provided with the raw answers. According to some embodiments the answers may be utilized to automatically generate other polls or queries.

The results may be reported to the poll requester in real time or according to any other method. The raw answers may be reported in real time while analytical data associated with the raw answers are reported at a later time. Any type of results may be reported to the poll requester in real time.

According to some embodiments a user that answers the query associated with the poll can access the results of the poll gathered up to the time the user answers or a subset of the results to the poll. As discussed herein polls may be automatically generated based on answers to previous polls. In some embodiments the poll requester can schedule polls to run automatically at various intervals and to update the polls based on previous poll results if desired. As also discussed herein the priority of a poll may change as the poll runs its course. The polling engine can provide previous poll results to the poll requester based on similarity of the poll requested to other polls previously conducted according to some embodiments. Polls can be delivered in any manner as discussed herein such as posted to a page delivered with advertisements accompanying a news story and so forth.

The above described components and functions can be comprised of instructions that are stored on a computer readable storage medium. The instructions can be retrieved and executed by a processor. Some examples of instructions are software program code and firmware. Some examples of storage medium are memory devices tape disks integrated circuits and servers.
