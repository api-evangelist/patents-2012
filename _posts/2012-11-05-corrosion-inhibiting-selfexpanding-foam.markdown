title: Corrosion inhibiting self-expanding foam
abstract: A corrosion prevention and control composition and method comprises combining primarily two-component polyurethane foam formed by reacting polyols with an isocyanate compound, and a 2 to 10 percent by weight of either an organic or inorganic gas-phase corrosion inhibitor. The closed cell foam provides a barrier protection for the underlying corrodible surface, while the inhibitor protects the metal from the absorbed moisture vapor, thereby preventing corrosion from occurring at the foam/metal interface. The resulting foam and inhibitor composition maintains better adhesion to the underlying corrodible structure in corrosive environments.

This application depends from and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 555 498 filed 4 Nov. 2011 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The disclosed invention was made with U.S. Government support by the Army Research Laboratory. The invention may be manufactured used sold imported or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties.

The present invention generally relates to corrosion protection and prevention and more particularly to a corrosion inhibiting self expanding foam system for use for example in hollow corrodible structures and other applications.

Surfaces such as metal and other corrodible surfaces are often exposed to extreme weathering temperatures moisture impurities and otherwise damaging external forces which accelerate corrosion. Conventional methods of corrosion protection include applying paints and other coatings such as petroleum based under coatings with a sprayer to the exposed surface. To be effective the entire exposed surface must be covered or the corrosion process will be accelerated at the unprotected areas. While open area surfaces may be easier to protect those surfaces found in internal cavities within an overall framework can be more challenging to protect. Achieving full coverage on internal surfaces can be extremely difficult and in some cases impossible without drilling several access openings in the structure. However these extraneous openings can compromise the strength of the structure as well as create more entryways for water and debris and the opportunity for corrosion to initiate at the edges of the openings.

Another method for protecting enclosed surfaces from corrosion is by using vapor phase corrosion inhibitors VCI . Under atmospheric corrosion conditions the method consists of saturating an enclosed surface with chemical vapors that enhance the corrosion resistance of the metal surface. Vapor phase corrosion inhibitors are typically used for corrosion prevention of sealed hollow structures but have been used in some paint formulations. Corrosion inhibiting pigments in paint primers provide protection by reacting with the absorbed moisture vapor to passivate the metal surface to reduce its corrosive characteristics. Vapor phase corrosion inhibitors aim to protect the metal surfaces primarily by changing the kinetics of the corrosion reaction without adversely affecting the material properties of the metal itself. However gas phase corrosion inhibitors offer no barrier protection because if the surfaces being protected are not completely enclosed from all sides the inhibitors can be easily washed away with the introduction of water etc. and the protection will be short lived.

Self expanding foams have been used for a number of applications the most common use being for thermal and noise insulation of homes industrial and metal roofing pipelines and automobiles. These foams have also been used for watercraft floatation and packaging padding material for shipping fragile electronic components. Additionally these foams have been used as another method of protecting enclosed surfaces from corrosion wherein the foam is applied to the metal surface to provide protection from foreign elements. However when used to fill and seal hollow metal structures against corrosives the foam is deficient in that it is permeable by moisture vapor which causes further degradation to its overall adhesion strength to the underlying surface. Thus although some foam have low moisture absorption and good initial adhesion properties water vapor can penetrate the foam and cause corrosion at the foam metal interface. Moreover once corrosion begins the adhesion of the foam to the metal surface degrades and the seal is oftentimes broken thereby allowing other corrosives to enter destroying the metal surface. This results in a disadvantageous structure which has an abbreviated useful life.

Therefore there remains a need for a process and a corrosion inhibiting composition which provides corrosion protection for example to underlying metal corrodible parts and structures which are difficult to access for corrosion protection. Moreover there remains a need for a singular corrosion inhibiting composition which is protected from being washed away and which results in improved adhesion qualities between it and the underlying corrodible surface to allow for maximized corrosion protection thereby overcoming the deficiencies of the prior art methods and systems.

In view of the foregoing embodiments of the invention provide a corrosion protection composition comprising a self expanding polyol foam and a vapor phase corrosion inhibitor. The self expanding foam comprises a first and a second component wherein the first component comprises an isocyanate compound or a cyanate ion NCO containing compound and wherein the second component comprises a polyol composition further comprising a blowing agent a catalyst a surfactant and a fire retardant component. Polyol a primary part of the second component or resin blend is typically based on mixtures of organic polyhydroxyl compounds having an OH number of about 10 to about 6233 more particularly from about 50 to about 1800. The polyols may have a nominal molecular weight average ranging from about 18 to about 10 000 more particularly from about 18 to about 6000 and most particularly from about 90 to about 6000. The polyols have a hydroxyl functionality of from about 2 to about 8 more particularly from about 2 to about 6. The polyhydroxyl compounds may for example comprise polyether polyols or mixtures of such polyether polyols known from polyurethane chemistry.

The polyols may have primary hydroxyl groups secondary hydroxyl groups or a mixture of primary and secondary hydroxyl groups. Further the polyols may be partially or completely capped with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide to alter the reactivity of the polyols or to increase the molecular weight of the polyols.

In embodiments the two primary types of polyols used in preparing polyurethanes include polyethers polyesters and the like.

Polyethers have a relatively low molecular weight in the range of from about 500 to about 3000 and are manufactured from propylene oxide PO and ethylene oxide EO . propylene oxide is the major constituent of the polyol mixture whereas ethylene oxide is only included in small amounts to modify the properties of the polyol. The functionality of the polyether polyol number of active hydroxyl groups per molecule can be varied and has a value for example of 2 for elastomers approximately 3 for flexible foams and up to 6 or more for rigid foams.

Polyether polyols include but are not limited to the ethoxylation and or propoxylation products of the from two 2 to the eight 8 functional starter molecules such as for example water ethylene glycol 1 2 dihydroxy propane trimethylol propane diethylene glycol triethylene glycol dipropylene glycol pentaerythritol glycerol sorbitol sucrose ethylene diamine polytetramethylene glycol and butylene oxide based polyols. Suitable mixtures of this kind may be obtained for example by subjecting mixtures of starter molecules of the type mentioned above as examples to an ethoxylation and or propoxylation reaction. Alternatively polyhydroxyl polyethers which have been prepared separately may subsequently be mixed together to form the polyol component according to embodiments of the present invention.

Polyols used in the manufacture of the foaming composition may comprise aromatic amino based polyether polyols for example those based on mixtures of 2 4 and 2 6 toluenediamine condensed with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide. These polyols may for example find utility in pour in place molded foams. Another example is the aromatic alkylamino based polyether polyols such as those based on ethoxylated and or propoxylated aminoethylated nonylphenol derivatives. These polyols generally find utility for example in spray applied polyurethane foams.

The polyester polyols are typically produced by the condensation reaction of a diol such as ethylene glycol with a dicarboxylic acid. Polyester polyols tend to be more expensive are usually more viscous and difficult to handle but develop polyurethanes with superior tensile abrasion flexing and oil resistance properties. Consequently they may be used for example to make polyurethanes for more demanding applications. A disadvantage of polyester based polyurethanes is their lower hydrolysis resistance.

Polyester polyols may also be obtained by the reaction of polyhydric alcohols with polybasic carboxylic acids such as adipic acids dimethyl terephthalate phthalic acid and or phthalic acid anhydride. These polyester polyols typically have a molecular weight average of from about 400 to about 4000. The polyol components may also contain small quantities of water in an amount of up to about two 2 percent by weight.

Typical polyols used in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foams include but are not limited to those based on glycerol ethylene glycol trimethylolpropane ethylene diamine pentaerythritol and the like condensed with ethylene oxide propylene oxide butylene oxide and the like. These are generally referred to as polyether polyols . Another example is the graft copolymer polyols which include but are not limited to conventional polyether polyols with vinyl polymer grafted to the polyether polyol chain. Yet another example comprises polyurea modified polyols which consist of conventional polyether polyols with polyurea particles dispersed in the polyol.

In embodiments the isocyanate can react with different chemical groups so the final properties of the polymer will vary according to the reaction route taken. The production of consistent end products depends on mixing in precise ratio the ingredient chemicals and maintenance of the appropriate processing temperatures. As the liquid isocyanate and polyol react to form polyurethane the liquid mix becomes increasingly viscous eventually forming a solid mass. The reaction is exothermic and heat is produced. Other ingredients will be included in the polyol blend for example the catalyst which controls the rate at which the liquid mixture reacts to become solid.

The foaming compositions that are produced in embodiments can vary in density from about 0.5 pound per cubic foot to about 40 pounds per cubic foot more particularly from about 1.0 to about 20.0 pounds per cubic foot and most particularly from about 1.5 to about 6.0 pounds per cubic foot for rigid polyurethane foams and from about 1.0 to about 4.0 pounds per cubic foot for flexible foams. The density obtained is a function of how much of the blowing agent or blowing agent mixture of the invention is present in the components or that is added at the time the foam is prepared. Two processes for forming polyurethanes have often been referred to either as a one component process or as a two component process.

 1 One Component System In a one component system a specially prepared prepolymer is allowed to undergo a chain reaction and cure in the presence of water vapor often referred to as moisture curing . Another process is to have a specially prepared prepolymer exposed to an amine atmosphere such as diamines or triamines often referred to as vapor curing .

 2 Two Component System In a two component system the polyol is first mixed with fillers plasticizers catalysts and flame retardants to form a resin component and this resin component is then mixed and reacted with the isocyanate diisocyanate polyisocyanate or other constituents.

The isocyanate or polyisocyanate composition comprises the first component. The polyol or polyol mixture surfactant catalysts blowing agents flame retardant water and other isocyanate reactive components comprise the second component. While the surfactant and fluorocarbon blowing agent are usually placed on the polyol side they may be placed on either side or partly on one side and partly on the other side. Accordingly polyurethane or polyisocyanate foams are readily prepared by bringing together the first and second side components either by hand mix for small preparations or for example machine mix techniques to form blocks slabs laminates pour in place panels and other items spray applied foams froths and the like.

The term polyisocyanate as used herein refers to any isocyanate having an average functionality greater than or equal to about 2.0. One example of a polyisocyanate first side component used in producing polyurethane are diphenylmethane diisocyanates or derivatives of these polyisocyanates which may contain carbodiimide biuret urethane isocyanurate allophanate groups and mixtures of compounds having these groups and are liquid at room temperature. Other examples of include organic polyisocyanates including but not limited to aromatic polyisocyanates aliphatic polyisocyanates prepolymers formed from aromatic or aliphatic polyisocyanates and mixtures thereof. Another example of a polyisocyanate for producing a rigid or closed cell polyurethane foam are polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates particularly the mixtures containing from about 30 to about 85 percent by weight of methylenebis phenyl isocyanate with the remainder of the mixture comprising polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates of functionality higher than 2. The methylene diphenyl diisocyanates MDI are one of the most widely used polyisocyanates with a functionality of about 2.0

Another example of a polyisocyanate for the preparation of a polyurethane elastomer is exemplified by a 4 4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate having an average functionality of about 2.1.

In embodiments polyisocyanates for rigid polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foam synthesis are the polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates particularly the mixtures containing from about 30 to about 85 percent by weight of methylene bis phenyl isocyanate with the remainder of the mixture comprising the polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates of functionality higher than two 2 .

Low density water blown polyurethane foams may be prepared by mixing the polyisocyanate first component the polyol second component or both in the diluent. Alternatively the diluent may be co injected as a separate component into conventional equipment that will mix the diluent and the other components of the reaction mixture. The mixture of the diluent and the other foaming composition components typically has a lower viscosity than the polyisocyanate or polyol component. Water is added to the polyol second component in an amount calculated to provide the desired amount of carbon dioxide to act as a blowing agent. Polyols are hygroscopic so the amount of water present in the polyol is typically measured and taken into account in calculating the amount of water to be added such that the total amount of water needed will be the sum of the water present in the polyol and the water added to the second component. The polyisocyanate polyol and water may be mixed by known methods including but not limited to static mixers. The polyurethane reaction mixture will form polyurethane with the carbon dioxide acting as a blowing agent to cause the polyurethane to form a foam structure.

Water blown closed cell low density rigid polyurethane foams made using known formulations generally have poor dimensional stability. Prior art prepared water blown closed cell low density polyurethane foams generally shrink and or collapsed over a period of time ranging from hours to months. The water blown closed cell low density polyurethane foams use carbon dioxide and are formed by the in situ reaction between water and a portion of the polyisocyanate present to cause the reacting polymer mixture to foam. After the polyurethane foam is fully formed the carbon dioxide may diffuse out of the closed cells faster than air can diffuse into the cells creating a vacuum. The resulting pressure differential causes the foam to shrink and or collapse. Surprisingly the use of a diluent in the polyurethane forming reaction mixture permits the formation of water blown closed cell rigid foams with improved dimensional stability. In embodiments the foams have a closed cell content of greater than about 50 percent more particularly greater than about 70 percent and in further embodiments greater than about 80 percent.

Flexible or open cell polyurethane foams are often manufactured using an excess of diisocyanate that reacts with water included as a raw material producing gaseous carbon dioxide and causing foam expansion. The flexible foams are widely used as cushioning materials in items such as furniture bedding and automobile seats. Additional blowing agents such as methylene chloride and or fluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons are required in addition to the water diisocyanate blowing mechanism in order to produce low density soft grades of foam.

In embodiments polyisocyanates for flexible polyurethane foam synthesis may be toluene diisocyanates comprising 2 4 toluene diisocyanate 2 6 toluene diisocyanate and mixtures thereof. Further comprising p phenylene diisocyanate polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate diphenyl methane diisocyanate m phenylene diisocyanate hexamethylene diisocyanate butylene 1 4 diisocyanate octamethylene diisocyanate 3 3 dimethoxy 4 4 biphenylene diisocyanate 1 18 octadecamethylene diisocyanate polymethylene diisocyanate benzene triisocyanate naphthylene 2 4 diisocyanate 3 3 dimethyl 4 4 biphenylene diisocyanate 1 methoxy phenylene 2 4 diisocyanate diphenylene 4 4 diisocyanate 4 4 diisocyanate diphenyl ether naphthylene 1 5 diisocyanate diisocyanate dicyclohexyl methane p xylylene diisocyanate xylylene diisocyanate hydrogenated diphenylene diisocyanate hydrogenated diphenyl methane diisocyanate toluene 2 4 6 triisocyanate 3 methyl 4 6 4 triisocyanate diphenyl methane 2 4 4 triisocyanate diphenyl and 2 4 4 triisocyanate diphenyl ether and mixtures thereof.

Additionally and in embodiments the corrosion inhibitor comprises from about 2 percent to about 10 percent by weight of the overall corrosion protection material prior to mixing.

Other embodiments comprise a method of inhibiting corrosion on a corrosive surface wherein the method comprises combining a barrier protection composition with a gas phase corrosion inhibiting composition to create a self expanding foam and allowing the self expanding foam to adhere to the corrosive surface wherein the barrier protection composition comprises polyurethane further wherein the barrier protection composition is formed by combining a first component with a second component still further wherein the first component comprises any of an isocyanate compound and a cyanate ion NCO containing compound and wherein the second component comprises a polyol composition comprising a blowing agent a catalyst a surfactant and a fire retardant component. In addition the vapor phase corrosion inhibiting composition comprises from about 2 percent to about 10 percent by weight of the self expanding foam. Also the gas phase corrosion inhibiting composition comprises either organic compounds or inorganic compounds. In embodiments the gas phase corrosion inhibiting composition is combined with the second component prior to combining the second component with the first component.

The invention is novel in its ability to inhibit corrosion thus maintaining better adhesion and to seal out corrosives from the otherwise corrodible structures that are exposed to corrosive environments. Specifically there are several distinct advantages of using the combination corrosion inhibiting polyurethane foam system and material composition provided by the invention over prior art and the spray on type methods 1 During the foam expansion phase the foam propagates through the structure to fill inaccessible voids 2 Once cured the foam adheres to the walls of the structure and provides a seal from water intrusion 3 The corrosion inhibitors are contained within the sealed structure and provide extended corrosion protection against the intrusion of water vapor and 4 The foam prevents the corrosion inhibitors from being washed away. Thus the invention is an advantageous process that provides the end user with a structure containing corrosion inhibitors and requires fewer access openings.

Furthermore the foaming composition provided by embodiments of the invention is an insulating material having an R value rating of R 7 per inch. Moreover the foam provided by embodiments of the invention for example is applicable in building construction ceilings walls floors tank insulation boats marine floatation oil drilling rigs and camps earthquake protection roofing duct work cold storages controlled atmosphere buildings condensation control and the like. Therefore many of the current uses that include adhesion to metal will be enhanced by the added corrosion inhibiting quality of the foam provided by the invention. Moreover the invention embodiments are also valuable for such commercial applications for example as automotive sound and thermal insulation underground pipelines hollow members of bridging structures double walled ocean going vessels telecommunication towers buoys and military systems such as vehicle frame rails and interior cavities rotary wing aircraft floor cavities deployable combat engineer bridging assets metal floatation devices and others.

As previously mentioned there is a need for novel corrosion inhibiting compositions that protect the surfaces of metal and other corrodible structures which results in improved adhesion qualities between the corrosion inhibiting composition and the underlying corrodible surface in order to seal out corrosives and allow for maximized corrosion protection and which overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art methods systems and compositions of corrosion protection.

Embodiments of the invention provide a corrosion prevention composition and method for use on structures. These structures may often contain voids that are inaccessible for conventional spray on type corrosion prevention techniques such as paints petroleum based corrosion inhibitors and under coatings. Furthermore very often water and other corrosives leak into these structures causing corrosion from the inside. Therefore the invention provides a corrosion inhibiting self expanding foam composition which is designed to solve this problem because as it expands the foam propagates through the structure and delivers corrosion inhibiting material throughout the structure and once cured the foam seals the structure from liquids and other corrosives.

Thus the invention provides a barrier protection composition with a vapor phase corrosion inhibiting composition to create a self expanding foam. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there are shown embodiments of the present invention.

As illustrated in an embodiment of the invention is shown being used in a hollow corrodible structure having an inner corrodible surface and an access opening . Pressurized canisters are used for the storage or mixing of the various components of the foam composition. A first pressurized canister stores a first component which comprises an isocyanate or a cyanate ion NCO containing compound. A second pressurized canister stores a mixture of a vapor phase corrosion inhibitor and a polyol blend comprising a blowing agent catalyst surfactant and fire retardant component. The corrosion inhibitor and polyol blend are combined in canister to form composition prior to pressurization. The pressure within the first and second canister may range from about twenty five to about two hundred and fifty pounds per square inch psi . The contents of canister i.e. the corrosion inhibitor and polyol blend mixture and the contents of canister i.e. the isocyanate or a cyanate ion NCO containing compound in embodiments are then sent via nozzles tubes respectively to a mixing chamber where they are mixed resulting in a polyol gas phase corrosion inhibitor mixture which creates a pre expanded foam mixture . An access nozzle provides extrusion means for the foam corrosion inhibitor composition to enter into the hollow structure through the access opening which then self expands and propagates through the entire structure . Once cured the compound forms a cohesive foam which provides barrier protection for the inner surface of the hollow structure including around the access opening . The result is a rigid closed cell foam that resists water intrusion.

Thus there are in embodiments two parts of the invention. First there is a vapor phase corrosion inhibitor component and second there is a polyurethane foam component. As described above and in embodiments the polyol blend and the gas phase corrosion inhibitor are mixed together in canister prior to the subsequent mixing with the first component the isocyanate or a cyanate ion NCO containing compound in the mixing chamber . In other embodiments the mixing of the various components may occur in any reasonable manner which provides for proper mixing dilution and for proper chemical composition mixture and balance.

As mentioned the first component in embodiments comprises an isocyanate or a cyanate ion NCO containing compound and the second component may comprise a polyol blend comprising a blowing agent catalyst surfactant and fire retardant component. More specifically the isocyanate compound may for example comprise any of 2 4 tolylene diisocyanate 2 6 tolylene diisocyanate p phenylene diisocyanate polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate diphenyl methane diisocyanate m phenylene diisocyanate hexamethylene diisocyanate butylene 1 4 diisocyanate octamethylene diisocyanate 3 3 dimethoxy 4 4 biphenylene diisocyanate 1 18 octadecamethylene diisocyanate polymethylene diisocyanate benzene triisocyanate naphthylene 2 4 diisocyanate 3 3 dimethyl 4 4 biphenylene diisocyanate 1 methoxy phenylene 2 4 diisocyanate diphenylene 4 4 diisocyanate 4 4 diisocyanate diphenyl ether naphthylene 1 5 diisocyanate diisocyanate dicyclohexyl methane p xylylene diisocyanate xylylene diisocyanate hydrogenated diphenylene diisocyanate hydrogenated diphenyl methane diisocyanate toluene 2 4 6 triisocyanate 3 methyl 4 6 4 triisocyanate diphenyl methane 2 4 4 triisocyanate diphenyl 2 4 4 triisocyanate diphenyl ether or mixtures thereof.

The blowing agent may comprise trichlorofluoromethane trichlorofluoroethane dichloromonofluoromethane monochloroethane monochloromonofluoroethane difluoromonochloroethane difluorodichloroethane or mixtures thereof.

Catalysts have a key role in the foam composition production. Catalysts are required to maintain a balance between the reaction of the isocyanate and polyol. The two main classes of catalyst used are the organometallics and the amines. The combination of very complex chemistry and diverse processing and molding conditions make great demands of the catalyst. The catalysts main function is to exploit the diverse reactions to create a product with the desired properties.

 1 Organometallic catalysts are used to accelerate the reaction and formation of urethane linkages and hence promote rapid curing.

Typical of such catalysts are organometallic compounds of lead tin titanium antimony cobalt aluminum mercury zinc nickel copper manganese zirconium and mixtures thereof. Exemplary catalysts include without limitation lead 2 ethylhexoate lead benzoate ferric chloride antimony trichloride and antimony glycolate. The organo tin class of catalysts comprises the stannous salts of carboxylic acids such as stannous octoate stannous 2 ethylhexoate stannous laurate and dialkyl tin salts of carboxylic acids such as dibutyl tin diacetate dibutyl tin dilaurate dioctyl tin diacetate and the like.

Amines are another class of catalysts widely used in the making of polyurethane foams. Some amine catalysts promote crosslinking while others assist in controlling the foam s cell structure. Typical catalysts include tertiary amines including but not limited to N alkylmorpholines N alkylalkanolamines. N N dialkylcyclohexylamines and alkylamines where the alkyl groups are methyl ethyl propyl butyl and the like and isomeric forms thereof as well as hetrocyclic amines. Particular examples include triethylenediamine tetramethylethylenediamine bis 2 dimethylaminoethyl ether triethylamine tripropylamine tributylamine triamylamine pyridine quinoline dimethylpiperazine piperazine N N dimethylcyclohexylamine N ethylmorpholine 2 methylpiperazine N N dimethylethanolamine tetramethylpropanediamine methyltriethylenediamine and mixtures thereof.

Adding a conventional catalyst or combination of conventional catalysts alters the rate of the foam formation. Catalysts for the isocyanate addition reaction include but are not limited to organic tin compounds such as tin II octoate dibutyl tin dilaurate or lead naphthenate PbN or tertiary amines such as N N dimethyl cyclohexylamine DMCHA 1 4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane TEDA and 70 percent bis dimethylaminoethyl ether in DPG or amine polyol catalysts such as 33 percent TEDA in glycol or dimethylethanolamine DMEA amine catalysts such as pentamethyldiethylenetriamine PMDETA . These catalysts are in embodiments generally used in a quantity of up to about 4 percent by weight and in embodiments from about 0.3 percent to about 1 percent by weight based on the total quantity of the foam forming composition.

As mentioned if gas phase corrosion inhibitors alone are applied in an unsealed hollow structure the inhibitors are consumed too quickly or washed away and the corrosion protection is short lived. Therefore and in embodiments the invention utilizes the foaming composition to confine the inhibitors as well as seal the inner surface from water and other corrosives. Thus the vapor phase corrosion inhibitors remain on the inner surface longer and provide extended corrosion protection compared to conventional systems.

The following example demonstrates the effectiveness of using an organic or inorganic vapor phase corrosion inhibitor in the self expanding foam formulation provided by the invention.

Fire retardants such as phosphorus and or halogen containing molecules are added to the foam formulations to meet certain flammability specifications and they are also used as mild plasticisers. Flame retardants such as tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tris 2 chloropropyl phosphate tris 2 3 dibromopropyl phosphate tris 1 3 dichloropropyl phosphate diammonium phosphate various halogenated aromatic compounds antimony oxide aluminum trihydrate polyvinyl chloride and the like. Other optional ingredients may include from about 0 to about 3 percent water which chemically reacts with the isocyanate to produce carbon dioxide.

Chain extenders are reactive low molecular weight di functional compounds such as hydroxylamines glycols or diamines and may be used to influence the end properties of the polyol foam. The chain extender reacts with the isocyanate to affect the hard soft segment relationship and therefore the modulus and glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer. The glass transition temperature provides a measure of the polymer s softening point and some indication of the safe upper limit of its working temperature range.

Blowing agents are used to provide gas bubbles in the polyol reaction mixture that form gas bubbles in the reaction mixture as it polymerizes. They are usually low boiling point liquids which are volatilized by the heat generated by the exothermic reaction between the isocyanate and polyol.

Organic blowing agents include but are not limited to non ozone depleting hydrofluorocarbons non ozone depleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons comprising for example trichlorofluoromethane CFC 11 and 1 1 dichloro 1 fluoroethane HCFC 141b because of their ease of use in the escape of certain chlorine constituents into the environment has mandated the use of other blowing agents. In view of the environmental concerns with respect to chlorofluorocarbon blowing agents it is now generally accepted that it would be more desirable to use hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFCs or hydrofluorocarbons HFCs rather than the chlorofluorocarbons. Exemplary hydrofluorocarbons suitable for use as blowing agents in the preparation of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams are 1 1 1 3 3 pentafluoropropane HFC 245fa 1 1 1 2 tetrafluoroethane HFC 134a and 1 1 2 2 tetrafluoroethane HFC 134 . These materials however possess a lower boiling point and a correspondingly higher vapor pressure than some other materials. Blowing agents may be used singly or in mixtures. The use of individual blowing agents or mixtures of blowing agents is determined by the desired properties of the polyol.

Other non ozone depleting blowing agents include other hydrofluorocarbons such as difluoromethane HFC 32 difluoroethane HFC 152 trifluoroethane HFC 143 tetrafluoroethane HFC 134 pentafluoropropane HFC 245 hexafluoropropane HFC 236 heptafluoropropane HFC 227 hydrocarbons such as butane isobutane n pentane isopentane cyclopentane hexane and isohexane inert gases e.g. air nitrogen carbon dioxide and water in an amount of from about 0.5 to about 2 parts per 100 parts of polyol. Difluoroethane trifluoroethane tetrafluoroethane heptafluoropropane and hexafluoropropane.

Hydrocarbon blowing agents such as n pentane isopentane and cyclopentane do not deplete stratospheric ozone but are extremely flammable. Foams expanded with a blowing agent composed only of hydrocarbons often require addition of expensive flame retardant materials to meet the regulations. Finally hydrocarbon blowing agents are classified as Volatile Organic Compounds and present environmental issues associated with photochemical smog production in the lower atmosphere.

In embodiments one approach is to use a mixture of one or more different hydrofluorocarbons HFCs or hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFCs or hydrofluorocarbons HFCs mixed with different hydrocarbons such as butane isobutane n pentane isopentane cyclopentane hexane and isohexane. This can be especially important where one component of the blowing agent is very flammable and the other component is nonflammable because minimizing fractionation during a leak or accidental spill minimizes the risk of producing extremely flammable mixtures.

As with other polymers the use of fillers will yield products with modified performance. Calcium carbonate and glass fibers are most commonly used. The former primarily to make cheaper formulations the latter are of growing interest in reaction injection moulding RIM technology.

Inorganic fillers like calcium carbonate and barium sulphate can be used to extend certain formulations but they may reduce many of the physical properties. Organic polymer dispersions in polyols can be used as reinforcing fillers these polyols are called polymer polyols .

Additives can include a plurality of compounds but all materials should be free of water so as to avoid invalidating stoichiometric calculations and or inadvertent COformation.

Plasticizers such as phthalates benzoates and aromatic oils can be used here again physical properties are often reduced. Other widely used additives are dyes pigments solvents and blowing agents. Surfactants better known as silicone oils are added to serve as cell stabilizers.

In an example a two 2 percent by weight concentration of an organic gas phase corrosion inhibitor is added to the polyol blend component to form component . While a 2 solution is used in this example an about 2 to about 10 percent solution may also be used. Because of the addition of the 2 percent gas phase corrosion inhibitor in this example the two components of the foam components and are then mixed in a 49 51 ratio respectively in canister and once combined into a mixture are injected into the hollow structure where it is allowed to expand and cure into a solid foam structure . While the foam portion provides the barrier protection the inhibitors protect the metal from the absorbed moisture vapor by changing the kinetics of the corrosion reaction. Consequently by preventing corrosion from occurring at the foam metal interface the foam maintains better adhesion to the corrodible structure which results in better sealing capabilities and better overall protection.

The adhesion tests were conducted using a modified version of the American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM 1002 99. The results of the tests shown in illustrate the adhesion strength results of polyurethane foam on steel substrates that were not pre corroded. As shown the adhesion of the foam samples with no vapor phase corrosion inhibitor added conventional methods was reduced by nearly 47 percent after only 500 hours of ASTM B117 salt fog testing which provides controlled atmospheric conditions. Conversely and in embodiments the polyurethane foam with the corrosion inhibitors as used in the invention clearly maintained better adhesion than the conventional composition after the 500 hours of salt fog exposure. In this example two different gas phase corrosion inhibitors were tested sodium lignosufinate and a mixture of amine carboxylate and amine molybdate.

As shown in prior to the salt fog testing Baseline unexposed portion of the graph the conventional sample provided an adhesion strength of approximately 21.5 psi while the samples using the invention s foam plus two 2 percent gas phase corrosion inhibitor composition yielded an adhesion strength of approximately 21.0 psi sodium lignosufinate and 17.0 psi a mixture of amine carboxylate and amine molybdate respectively. However upon subjecting the samples to the salt fog environment the adhesive strengths for the respective samples provided stark contrasting results. After exposure the adhesion strength of the sodium lignosufinate and a mixture of amine carboxylate and amine molybdate samples maintained adhesion strengths of approximately 20.5 psi and 19.95 psi respectively. By contrast the drop off in the adhesive strength of the prior art sample was approximately 9.5 psi from 21.5 psi down to 12.0 psi . Thus as illustrated the invention maintains its adhesion strength compared with the prior art compositions after exposure to ASTM B117 salt fog testing.

As indicated the prior art compositions do not provide adequate corrosion protection of the underlying corrodible surface and as such those corrodible surfaces are subject to greater corrosion. Whereas embodiments of the present disclosure by combining a self expanding foaming composition with corrosion inhibitors allows the underlying corrodible surface to be protected from all sides and to ward off corrosive effects.

The foregoing description of specific embodiments reveals the general nature of the invention that others can by applying current knowledge readily modify and or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept and therefore such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments. It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.
