The present invention relates to a medicine in particular a novel pyridine derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable ester thereof or a pharmacologically acceptable salt of the derivative or ester which has a hypoglycemic effect or treats and or prevents the onset of a disorder of carbohydrate or lipid metabolism or a disease mediated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor PPAR .

The present invention also relates to a therapeutic agent and or prophylactic agent for diabetes especially type II diabetes hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia adiposity impaired glucose tolerance insulin resistance impaired fasting glucose cachexia psoriasis diabetic complications arteriosclerosis atherosclerosis hypertension pancreatitis polycystic ovary syndrome fatty liver nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH gestational diabetes mellitus inflammatory disease cancer osteoporosis involutional osteoporosis neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer s disease hyperuricemia metabolic syndrome or the like which has an effect of improving carbohydrate or lipid metabolism an effect of improving insulin resistance an antiinflammatory effect or an effect of inhibiting the growth of cancer cells the therapeutic agent and or prophylactic agent comprising a novel pyridine derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable ester thereof or a pharmacologically acceptable salt of the derivative or ester as an active ingredient.

In recent years the number of patients with metabolic syndrome such as type II diabetes hyperinsulinemia dyslipidemia adiposity hypertension or atherosclerotic disease has been increasing around the world due to reasons such as changes in lifestyles. Patients with metabolic syndrome have a several fold increased risk of coronary artery disease cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage and are further affected with chronic complications such as nephropathy neuropathy and retinopathy. The increase in the number of patients with complications has been a major cause of rising medical costs Non Patent Document 1 .

Recent researches have shown that ligands acting on PPAR are useful for the prevention or improvement of a pathology called metabolic syndrome such as type II diabetes hyperinsulinemia dyslipidemia adiposity hypertension atherosclerotic disease or insulin resistance Non Patent Document 2 . Ligands acting on PPAR inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines Non Patent Documents 3 and 4 and induce apoptosis to inhibit the growth of cancer cells Non Patent Document 5 . Therefore the ligands are also useful for the prevention or improvement of inflammatory disease or cancer. Specific examples of the ligands activating PPAR include pioglitazone Non Patent Document 6 and rosiglitazone Non Patent Document 7 classified into thiazolidinedione drugs already medically used in the treatment of type II diabetes. These thiazolidinedione drugs have side effects such as fluid retention body weight increase and increased risks for heart disease. Therefore safer pharmaceuticals have been desired to be developed Patent Document 1 . Many researchers have now been researching and developing pharmaceuticals with an aim to prevent or improve insulin resistance diseases caused by inflammation or the like or metabolic syndrome through researches of ligands activating or inhibiting PPAR PPAR or PPAR Non Patent Document 8 .

Patent Document 2 describes compounds having an alkoxy group a substituted phenyloxy group a pyridyloxy group or the like bonded to the 6 position of a benzimidazole group as derivatives having the same skeleton as in the compounds of the present invention and use of those compounds as therapeutic agents for diabetes hyperglycemia or the like. However in the synthetic examples in this document the sole pyridyloxy group at the 6 position of the benzimidazole group is an unsubstituted 3 pyridyloxy group. On the other hand in the compounds of the present invention a pyridyloxy group having 1 to 3 substituent s is bonded to the 6 position of a benzimidazole group.

The present inventors have conducted extensive studies to develop therapeutic agents and or prophylactic agents for disorders of carbohydrate or lipid metabolism or diseases mediated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor PPAR . Thus the inventors have found that pyridine derivatives having a specific chemical structure have an excellent hypoglycemic effect or have an effect of improving carbohydrate or lipid metabolism an effect of improving insulin resistance or an effect of improving so called metabolic syndrome such as arteriosclerosis hypertension cardiovascular disorder or complications derived from them or a pathology caused by various inflammations. The inventors have further found that the compounds are ligands acting on peroxisome proliferator activated receptor PPAR and therefore have an effect of inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. These findings have led to the completion of the present invention.

Rosiglitazone used in Examples is a commercially available PPAR activator and is a compound described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 002 953 and can be produced according to the method described therein.

A test was carried out according to the reporter assay method with reference to a report by Kliewer et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry 1995 Vol. 270 22 p. 12953 12956 as a method for measuring the ability of a compound to activate PPAR hereinafter PPAR activation effect modulator activity . Commercially available reagents and kits were used according to the attached instructions. The details will be shown below.

The ligand binding domain of human PPAR corresponding to about 300 amino acids at the carboxy end was bound to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 corresponding to 147 amino acids at the amino end with reference to the report by Kliewer et al. to prepare a gene expressing a GAL4 PPAR receptor.

The base sequence of the human PPAR gene is described in the gene database GenBank under Accession No. X90563.

The cell line HepG2 American Type Culture Collection HB 8065 was purchased from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and cultured in a tissue culture flask having a culture area of 75 cm manufactured by BD Biosciences . Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium Gibco D MEM manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation supplemented with fetal bovine serum manufactured by HyClone at a volume ratio of 10 and an antibiotic solution Antibiotic Antimycotic Solution stabilized 100 manufactured by Sigma at a volume ratio of 1 was used as a medium.

The cells were cultured in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37 C. under 5 carbon dioxide for three days. When the cells were grown to an approximately semiconfluent state the medium in the flask was removed by aspiration. The cells were washed by adding 10 ml of ice cooled phosphate buffered saline Gibco Dulbecco s Phosphate Buffered Saline manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation and then the saline was removed by aspiration. Thereafter 7.5 ml of Trizol reagent Gibco TRIZOL reagent manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation was added to the cells in the flask and repeatedly pipetted. The cells were lysed by incubating at room temperature for about five minutes.

The cell lysate was subjected to precipitation with isopropyl alcohol according to the instructions of the Trizol reagent. The resulting RNA precipitate was dissolved in pure water and stored in a freezer at about 20 C. Here the volume of the RNA solution was 0.22 ml. A sample obtained by diluting a part of the RNA solution 100 fold with pure water had an absorbance at 260 nm of 0.562. The yield of the total RNA was calculated to be 0.562 100 39.5 0.22 488 g assuming that 39.5 g ml of RNA was present when the absorbance was 1.

Two oligonucleotides represented by SEQ ID NOS 1 and 2 in the later described Sequence Listing as designed based on the gene sequence of human PPAR were chemically synthesized as primers for amplification by reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction hereinafter RT PCR of cDNA of the PPAR ligand binding domain using Beckman Oligo 1000 manufactured by Beckman .

cDNA of PPAR was amplified by RT PCR using Ready To Go RT PCR Beads manufactured by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc. with the HepG2 total RNA previously obtained as a template and the two oligonucleotides as primers. The reaction product was subjected to 1.5 agarose electrophoresis. The amplified band of about 900 base pairs was cut out purified and cloned to the plasmid pCRII manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation . The amplified DNA fragment is assumed to have the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 3 of the Sequence Listing which includes a sequence encoding the ligand binding domain specifically amino acids 175 to 475 of human PPAR and to which a restriction enzyme BamHI cleavage site and a restriction enzyme HindIII site are added on the 5 terminal and 3 terminal respectively. The plasmid clone correctly containing the sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 3 was selected by confirming the nucleotide sequence.

Next the selected plasmid was treated with restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII to obtain a 900 base pair fragment containing the gene of the PPAR ligand binding domain. This was inserted into the BamHI HindIII site of the plasmid pM having the gene of the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 manufactured by Clontech Laboratories Inc. and cloned.

The plasmid pM PPAR obtained by the above operation includes the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 4 of the Sequence Listing and encodes an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO 5 of the Sequence Listing containing amino acids 1 to 147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 at the amino end and containing amino acids 175 to 475 of human PPAR and a stop codon at the carboxy end. The plasmid is a gene that can express a GAL4 PPAR chimeric receptor in mammalian cells.

The test compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 4 mM. The solution was serially diluted 3.3 fold with dimethyl sulfoxide to prepare solutions of the compound at concentrations up to 400 nM. Dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared for the control group. Rosiglitazone dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 4 mM was prepared for the positive control group. They were diluted 20 fold with the medium and 5 L of the dilution was added to the wells in which the cells were grown. The concentrations of the test compound treating the cells ranged from 10 M to 1 nM. After the addition the cells were cultured overnight.

On the following day the medium was removed and Luc Lite manufactured by PerkinElmer Inc. was prepared according to the attached document and added at 50 microliters per well. The plate with cells in the Luc Lite was stirred for about 30 minutes. The amount of luminescence in each well was measured as luciferase activity using Analyst Molecular Devices for 0.5 second. A dose dependent curve was drawn.

When the luciferase activity of the positive control group was 100 and the luciferase activity of the control group was 0 the maximum luciferase activity exhibited by the test compound alone was calculated as Emax and the concentration of the test compound represented by Emax 2 was calculated as EC50.

The smaller the EC50 value of the compound the more potent the PPAR activation effect modulator activity of the compound.
