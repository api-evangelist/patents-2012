In a medical setting patient data may be obtained via various workflows. In one workflow physiological sensor devices are physically attached to a patient and patient data is continually monitored from the physiological sensor devices. In another workflow spot or episodic data is obtained from a patient typically by a nurse or other clinician at intervals dictated by the workflow and by an acuity level for each patient.

Patient data obtained on a continuous basis is commonly displayed on a central display station so that clinicians can easily view vital signs being monitored for the patient. Patient data obtained on a spot or episodic basis is often manually entered on a patient chart or stored in a computer system. Clinicians needing to view both patient data obtained on a continuous basis and patient data obtained on a spot or episodic basis often need to access multiple computer systems display stations or documents in order to view both types of patient data.

Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to systems and methods for displaying medical data. Physiological data is received from a first medical monitoring device. The physiological data is obtained on a continuous basis. Physiological data is received from a second medical monitoring device. The physiological data from the second medical monitoring device is obtained on a non continuous basis. The physiological data received from the first medical monitoring device and the physiological data received from the second medical monitoring device are displayed on a central display station. The central display station is located centrally within a care unit of a caregiving facility.

The details of one or more techniques are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages of these techniques will be apparent from the description drawings and claims.

The present disclosure is directed to a system and methods for integrating continuous and episodic data from a patient at a central display station.

In example embodiments the central display station receives patient data from one or more monitoring devices that receive continuous physiological data for the patient. The central display station also receives patient data from one or more spot or episodic devices that obtain physiological data from the patient from spot or episodic monitoring devices for example a portable vital signs measurement device. The continuous physiological data and the episodic physiological data are integrated and displayed at the central display station.

The central display station is typically located at a central location within a care unit of caregiving facility e.g. hospital or clinic for example at a central nurse s station so that the physiological data may be easily viewed by clinicians. A care unit is an area of the caregiving facility in which patients are treated and monitored. In example embodiments a caregiving facility may have one or more central display stations located at hubs or nurses areas in care units throughout the facility so that caregivers can easily access the central display stations to monitor multiple patients at once. In this disclosure episodic physiological data refers to physiological data obtained on a non continuous basis. In this disclosure the terms episodic and spot are used interchangeably.

The continuous monitoring device may be physically connected to the central display station or may be connected to the central display station via a wireless connection. The episodic monitoring device is typically connected to the central display station via a wireless connection. More than one continuous monitoring device and episodic monitoring device may be used.

The example continuous monitoring device is a monitoring device that receives physiological data from a patient on a continuous basis typically at millisecond intervals. Continuous physiological data is typically obtained for acute patients for example from surgical patients or from post surgical patients in an intensive care unit. Examples of continuous physiological data include blood pressure temperature pulse rate oxygen saturation level SPO2 end tidal carbon dioxide ETCO2 and respiratory rate. Other types of physiological data are possible. The physiological data is typically displayed on the continuous monitoring device which is typically located near the patient. An example of a continuous monitoring device is the Welch Allyn 1500 Patient Monitor from Welch Allyn Inc. of Skaneateles Falls N.Y.

The example episodic monitoring device is a monitoring device that receives physiological data from a patient on an episodic or spot basis. Episodic data is typically obtained for less acute patients for example a patient recovering from surgery but out of intensive care. For these patients physiological data may be obtained via a vital signs device that may be manually operated by a clinician for example by a nurse or a certified nursing assistant CNA . Examples of episodic data obtained from the vital signs device include blood pressure temperature pulse rate and SPO2. Other examples of episodic data are possible. Episodic data such as blood pressure temperature pulse rate and SPO2 may also be obtained on a continuous basis. However when this data is obtained at specified intervals for example when a nurse manually takes a patient s blood pressure and temperature the data is designated as episodic data. For example a nurse may manually obtain an oxygen saturation reading by manually clipping an SPO2 sensor to the patient and monitoring the SPO2 via a vital signs device. An example vital signs device is the Connex Vital Signs Monitor from Welch Allyn Inc. of Skaneateles Falls N.Y. Intervals are typically specified by physician orders or care unit protocols.

The example central display station includes a continuous connectivity service module an episodic connectivity service module a continuous patient data service module a central display station user interface a client services module a continuous patient data store and a vital signs database . In examples the continuous patient data store and the vital signs database may be stored on databases external to the central display station .

As shown in physiological data from the continuous monitoring device is processed by continuous connectivity service module . The example continuous connectivity service module provides connectivity services for continuous monitoring of devices such as the continuous monitoring device . Example connectivity services provided by the continuous connectivity service module include receiving and routing continuous physiological data for a patient to application software for displaying the continuous physiological data on user interface of the central display station and for storing the continuous physiological data in a continuous patient data store and in a vital signs database .

Physiological data from the episodic monitoring device is processed by episodic connectivity service module . The example episodic connectivity service module provides connectivity services for episodic monitoring devices such as the episodic monitoring device . Example connectivity services provided by the episodic connectivity service module includes routing episodic physiological data for a patient to application software for displaying the episodic physiological data on user interface of the central display station and for storing the episodic physiological data in the vital signs database .

The example continuous patient data service module is an application programming interface API used by the continuous connectivity service module to store continuous physiological data for the patient in the continuous patient data store . API commands from the continuous connectivity service module are used to store the continuous physiological data for the patient in the continuous patient data store . In addition as explained later herein API commands from the continuous patient data service module are used to retrieve continuous patient data from the continuous patient data store and provide the continuous patient data to central display station user interface .

The example central display station user interface provides a user interface for the central display station. The user interface includes a plurality of display tiles that display physiological information for patients as explained in more detail later herein.

The example client services module provides support for storage retrieval and modification of data entries including but not limited to patients visits episodic tests user accounts and device connections. Access to the client services module is via APIs typically provided by a dynamic link library DLL referred to as a client framework not shown in .

The example continuous patient data store is a repository for physiological data received from continuous monitoring device and from other continuous monitoring devices. The physiological data stored in the continuous patient data store can be later retrieved for detailed display on the user interface of the central display station .

The example vital signs data base is a repository for physiological data received from episodic monitoring device and from other episodic monitoring devices. The physiological data stored in the vital signs database can be later retrieved for detailed display on the user interface of the central display station .

The continuous connectivity service module uses one or more API commands to send the continuous physiological data for the patient to the continuous patient data service module . The continuous patient data service module uses file system API commands to store the continuous physiological data for the patient in the continuous patient data store .

The continuous connectivity service module also sends the continuous physiological data for the patient to client service module . The client service module uses API commands typically SQL commands to store the continuous physiological data in the vital signs database . As discussed the vital signs database stores episodic physiological data for a patient. However some physiological data collected from a continuous device may also include episodic type data. For example pulse rate may be obtained on an episodic basis when a nurse or CNA makes rounds and manually obtains the pulse rate of a patient. However pulse rate is also obtained during the process of measuring oxygen saturation SPO2 . Because pulse rate data is available from the measurement of SPO2 that pulse rate data is also stored in the vital signs database .

As another example NIBP may be measured manually by a nurse or CNA but may also be automatically taken at intervals for example when an automatic blood pressure machine is connected to the patient. Pulse rate is typically obtained by automatic blood pressure machines when measuring blood pressure. The pulse rate obtained on an interval basis by the automatic blood pressure machine is stored in the vital signs database in addition to blood pressure obtained from spot vital signs measuring devices.

In the example system physiological data obtained on an episodic basis for a patient is sent to the episodic connectivity service module . The episodic connectivity service module uses one or more API commands to send the episodic physiological data to the client services module . The client services module uses API commands typically SQL commands to store the episodic physiological data for the patient in the vital signs database .

The system includes an example integrated review module that integrates continuous physiological data stored in the continuous patient data store with episodic physiological data stored in the vital signs database . The integrated review module displays the integrated continuous and episodic physiological data for a patient on a detailed display tile of the user interface of the central display station . The integrated review module also permits a display of alarms for a patient and provides continuous and episodic physiological data for a patient in graphical timeline and tabular formats.

In system the integrated review module receives physiological data obtained for a patient on a continuous basis from the continuous patient data store . A request is made via API commands to the continuous patient data service module . The continuous patient data service module uses file system API commands to obtain the continuous physiological data from the continuous patient data store and send the continuous physiological data for the patient to the integrated review module .

The integrated review module also receives physiological data obtained for a patient on a spot or episodic basis from the vital signs database . A request is made via API commands and a client framework to the client service module . The client services module uses database commands typically SQL commands to obtain episodic physiological data for the patient from the vital signs database and send the episodic physiological data for the patient to the integrated review module .

The integrated review module integrates the physiological data received from the continuous patient data store and the vital signs database and supplies the integrated physiological data to the user interface of the central display station . Integrating the physiological data refers to identifying and processing continuous and episodic physiological data with common time positions and presenting the continuous and episodic physiological data for display. Integration may also involve correlating some physiological data from the continuous patient data store and the vital signs database .

For example a pulse rate may have been obtained from a NIBP measurement stored in the vital signs database and from a SPO2 measurement stored in the continuous patient data store . The integration results in a display of the pulse rate in a correct time position in relation to other physiological data occurring during a common time period. The integrated physiological data may be displayed on a device detail screen or on one or more review screens as explained later herein.

Processing the physiological data from the continuous patient data store and the vital signs database also involves up sampling or down sampling the physiological data. Large amounts of physiological data may be stored in the continuous patient data stored and the vital signs database . For example physiological data for a patient from one or more physiological sensors may be obtained at short intervals for example at one second intervals on a continuous basis. This amount of continuous data can be too much data to be effectively displayed on the user interface of the central display station .

For this reason sampling is used. Down sampling involves displaying only a portion of the data stored in the continuous patient data store or the vital signs database . Down sampling refers to sampling at a higher sampling rate to display less physiological data on a chart or graph. Up sampling refers to sampling at a lower rate to display more physiological data on the chart or graph. For example when a clinician wants to see a high level summary of the physiological data for example at hour intervals down sampling may be used. When a clinician needs to focus on a portion of the physiological data for example at one second intervals up sampling may be used.

The integrated review module typically comprises two layers a plug in module and an integrative review service. The plug in module typically provides a user interface for displaying the one or more review screens. The integrative review service provides application software for integrating and processing the review data. In some embodiments the user interface functions and the integrative review service both reside on the central display station.

In other embodiments the integrative review service may reside on a server computer and the plug in functionality may reside on a laptop or other portable computer. When the plug in functionality resides on the laptop or other portable computer the laptop or other portable computer acts as a thin client. A thin client refers to a small application running on the laptop or other portable computer. When physiological data is transferred between the laptop or other portable computer and the server computer the physiological data transferred comprises sampled physiological data. Performing integration and processing of the physiological data on the server computer and transferring down sampled physiological data to the laptop or other portable computer significantly reduces the amount of physiological data that needs to be transmitted improving the user experience and reducing demands on the wireless network that typically interconnects those devices.

The example device detail screen also includes data such as height weight pain indication and BMI body mass index for the patient alarm threshold ranges for the patient such as an alarm threshold range of 50 200 for pulse rate and an alarm threshold range of 10 30 for respiration rate. More or fewer details and physiological parameters may be displayed.

The example device detail screen also includes an example review button . When the review button is selected a review screen is displayed. The review screen permits a clinician to display alarms that have occurred for the patient and tabular or graphical displays of continuous and episodic physiological data for the patient. In addition the review screen includes controls that permit refinement of the tabular and graphical displays of the continuous and episodic and physiological data for the patient. An example of a graphical display is a timeline showing changes in the continuous and episodic physiological data over time.

The flow sheet tab includes three controls that permit refinement of the trend episodic physiological data displayed on the review screen . History control permits selection of a history time period for the episodic physiological data. The history time period represents a time range for which the episodic physiological data is obtained from a vital signs database for example from vital signs database .

Every entry of episodic physiological data stored in vital signs database includes a timestamp. The history time period represents a range of time for which entries are retrieved from vital signs database . As shown in episodic physiological data is retrieved from the vital signs database for a period of time corresponding to the last 24 hours. Other time periods are possible including for example 48 hours 72 hours 96 hours seven days one month and six months.

Timespan control permits selection for a timespan for the display of episodic physiological data for the patient. The timespan represents a range of time that is actually displayed on the review screen in this case 8 hours. By adjusting scroll bar up to 8 hours of trend episodic data may be displayed. Other time spans are possible for example 1 hour 2 hours 4 hours 8 hours 12 hours and 24 hours Timespans of 8 hours or 12 hours may be default timespans corresponding to typical lengths of a nurse s shift.

Time window control shows a time window corresponding to the timespan selected by control . For example the length of control corresponds to a period of 8 hours. A user can move the position of time window control to select other 8 hour time intervals within the history data available in this example within a 24 hour period.

The trend episodic physiological data displayed in review screen provides example episodic physiological parameters including TEMP NIBP PR SPO2 pain weight and height. Values of each of these parameters are provided in tabular form for selected times and dates including a first set of displayed values from March 6 at 15 56 02 to a last displayed values from March 6 at 15 29 45.

Every entry of continuous physiological data stored in continuous patient data store includes a timestamp. The history time period represents a range of time for which entries are retrieved from continuous patient data store .

The timespan represents a range of time that is actually displayed on the review screen in this case 8 hours. By adjusting scroll bar up to 8 hours of trend episodic data may be displayed. Other time spans are possible.

Interval control permits selection of a frequency for down sampling continuous data from the continuous patient data store . Review screen shows a sampling frequency of 15 minutes indicating that physiological data for each continuous physiological parameter displayed on review screen is obtained from the continuous patient data store every 15 minutes. If a clinician needed more detailed trend data a shorter frequency for example one minute may be selected. If a clinician wanted less detail a longer frequency for example one hour may be selected

Time window control shows a time window corresponding to the timespan selected by interval control . For example the length of time window control corresponds to a period of 8 hours. A user can move the position of control to select other 8 hour time intervals within the history data available in this example within a 24 hour period.

In review screen continuous physiological data and episodic physiological data are shown in tabular form. Timestamps for trend data are shown in a column labeled . The physiological parameters being monitored are shown in a row labeled . In this example the physiological parameters being monitored include temperature TEMP non invasive blood pressure NIBP pulse rate PR respiration rate RR oxygen saturation SPO2 end tidal carbon dioxide ETCO2 integrated pulmonary index IPI and total hemoglobin SPHB . The values for the physiological parameters show trends in these parameters over time.
