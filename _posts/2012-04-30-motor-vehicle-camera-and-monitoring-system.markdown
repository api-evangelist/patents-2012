An embodiment of the invention relate generally to camera used on motor vehicles which includes heavy duty fleet vehicles and a system for monitoring these vehicles.

When products are manufactured at a factory the supervisor is able to monitor the assembly line using surveillance cameras to ensure that the products are being handled appropriately and that the employees are safely performing their jobs. The surveillance cameras also ensure that there is accountability when there are issues in the factory. However once the product is loaded onto a commercial truck for shipping the supervisor are no longer able to monitor the truck the driver or the cargo in the same manner as he could in the factory.

Similarly in the transportation industry the supervisor is unable to monitor the driver s driving or his interactions with the passengers. The supervisor is currently dependent on feedback from the passengers to uncover a driver s misconduct. Further there is no way for the supervisor to have access to a black box to determine what transpired when there is an accident and black box is destroyed. Further when the driver is subjected to danger on the bus there is no evidence to identify his aggressors.

Moreover in the waste industry two workers are typically needed on each truck the driver and the person on picking up the garbage bags. Just as in public transportation industry the waste industry supervisor is also unable to monitor the workers to ensure their safety and he is also unable to review the workers on the job conduct.

In one embodiment of the invention a fleet camera apparatus is used to monitor of fleet vehicles. This fleet camera apparatus may be mounted on a fleet vehicle to capture video data. Based on the location of the fleet camera apparatus the captured video data may provide images of the inside or outside of the fleet vehicle. This video data may be streamed using a client device such as a smart phone or a laptop. In this embodiment the fleet camera apparatus comprises an external housing a camera lens cover a camera module including a camera lens a lighting component a dimmer switch and a transmission medium. The external housing may be made of alloy and may have a front side a back side an extended hooded portion and a base for mounting the apparatus. The fleet camera apparatus may further include a camera cover being fitted on a first opening on the front side of the external housing and a camera module that captures video data and includes a camera lens that faces the camera cover. The transmission medium may be coupled to the camera module to transmit the captured video data as a live video stream to an external device. The lighting component included in the fleet camera apparatus may include light emitting diodes LEDs and have infra red IR capabilities to provide a night vision mode. The lighting component may also be facing the camera cover. The dimmer switch is included in the fleet camera apparatus to control the brightness of the lighting component.

In another embodiment of the invention a system for monitoring of fleet vehicles comprises a plurality of cameras and a network device. Each of the plurality of cameras may include an external housing made of alloy and having a front side and a back side a camera cover being fitted on a first opening on the front side of the external housing a camera module including a camera lens that faces the camera cover to capture video data a lighting component facing the camera cover and including a plurality of light emitting diodes LEDs and having infra red IR capabilities to provide a night vision mode a dimmer switch controlling the brightness of the lighting component and a transmission medium coupled to the camera module to transmit the video data as a live video stream. The network device may include a communication interface and a recording unit. The communication interface is coupled to the transmission medium of each of the cameras to receive the live video stream and is coupled to the cloud storage to transmit the live video stream. The recording unit of the network device may record the live video stream. At least one client device may access the cloud storage to receive the live video stream.

The above summary does not include an exhaustive list of all aspects of the present invention. It is contemplated that the invention includes all systems apparatuses and methods that can be practiced from all suitable combinations of the various aspects summarized above as well as those disclosed in the Detailed Description below and particularly pointed out in the claims filed with the application. Such combinations may have particular advantages not specifically recited in the above summary.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth. However it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known circuits structures and techniques have not been shown to avoid obscuring the understanding of this description.

The network device may be a digital device that is coupled to the cameras to receive live video streams from each of the cameras on the motor vehicles. While it is contemplated that the cameras may be mounted on a heavy duty fleet vehicle such as a tractor trailer truck it is understood that the cameras may be mounted on all kinds of motor vehicle e.g. bus garbage truck truck car etc. . . . . In an exemplary block diagram of a network device according to one embodiment of the invention is shown. As illustrated in the network device may include a recording unit a communication interface a location tracking unit an input sensing unit and a processor .

The processor may be coupled to the recording unit the communication interface the location tracking unit and the input sensing unit . The processor may be any processing device including but not limited or restricted to a microprocessor a digital signal processor an application specific integrated circuit a microcontroller a state machine or any type of programmable logic array.

The communication interface may include a wired network interface such as an Ethernet interface and a wireless interface such as a WiFi interface. The communication interface receives a live video stream from the cameras . In one embodiment the wired network interface of the communication interface is coupled to a transmission medium of a camera and the wired network interface receives the live video stream from the camera . The communication interface may also include a mobile communication interface that communicates with a mobile telecommunication network such as 3G and 4G. In one embodiment the communication interface uses the mobile communication interface to transmit the live video stream received from the camera to the cloud storage . In another embodiment the communication interface uses the wireless interface to transmit the live video stream received from the camera to the cloud storage . It is also contemplated that the communication interface may use any combination of the mobile communication interface and the wireless interface to transmit the live video stream to the cloud storage .

As further illustrated in the network device may also include the location tracking unit that receives the location of the network device . The location tracking unit may include a Global Positioning System GPS receiver to receive the location of the network device as positioning coordinates e.g. longitude and latitude . In some embodiments the processor associates the location of the network device with the corresponding video data received by the communication interface . Accordingly in this embodiment the communication interface transmits the live video stream and a corresponding location to the cloud storage . For example when a supervisor views the live video stream of a delivery truck on a client device the client device may also display on a visual map the location of the delivery truck associated with the live video display. Additionally if the supervisor requests to view a video corresponding to a specific date and time when the video is displayed the location of the truck at that specific date and time may also be displayed for the supervisor.

In one embodiment the recording unit included in the network device includes a digital video recorder. The recording unit may is coupled to the communication interface to record the live video stream received from the camera .

In another embodiment the network device is also coupled to the motor vehicles on which the cameras are respectively mounted. The motor vehicles may include a plurality of motor vehicle sensors such as temperature sensors speed sensors door status sensors engine loading sensors water data sensors oil data sensors etc. The network device may receive data from the motor vehicles sensors and send this data to the cloud storage . In this embodiment the processor may associate the data from the motor vehicle sensors with the corresponding video data received by the communication interface such that a client device that accesses the cloud storage may obtain this data in conjunction with the video data e.g. live or recorded .

In another embodiment the network device is also equipped with an input sensing unit which automatically senses the communication interface s inputs and determines if a connection is established with each of the inputs. For instance the input sensing unit may sense which input has a camera coupled thereto. If the input sensing unit senses that a first input is coupled to camera the input sensing unit will send a signal to the processor that camera is connected and the communication interface transmits the live video stream from camera to the cloud storage and in turn to at least one client device to be displayed. If the input sensing unit senses that a second input is not coupled to camera the input sensing unit may send a signal to the processor indicating that camera is not connected and the communication interface will not transmit any data to the cloud storage . By not sending any data between the network device and the cloud storage this embodiment of the invention minimizes unnecessary data transfers e.g. blank screens and thus improves the bandwidth usage in the system between the network device the cloud storage and the client devices .

In other embodiments the input sensing unit may send an enable signal which indicates that a connection is made between a camera and an input included in the communication interface and may not send any signal when the input sensing unit senses that no connection established.

Referring back to the system also includes the cloud storage that is an online storage that may be hosted by a third party. The cloud storage receives the live video streaming from the network device and may be accessed through a Web based user interface or through a web service application programming interface API by the plurality of client devices .

The client devices may be coupled to the cloud storage via a wireless connection or via a mobile telecommunication connection. For example the client device may be a smart phone and the user may access the cloud storage via a Web based user interface on the smart phone using a wireless connection to the Internet or using a 3G or 4G network. It is contemplated that the client devices may be wireless electronic devices capable of receiving the live video streams such as personal computers laptop computers wireless music players portable telephone communications devices smart phones tablets digital televisions etc.

Referring back to the system also includes a plurality of cameras . The cameras may be mounted on a motor vehicle such as a fleet vehicle to capture video data and provide the live data stream to the network device . Based on the location of the cameras on the fleet vehicle the captured video data may provide images of the inside or outside of the fleet vehicle. The cameras may be mounted on the exterior of the fleet vehicle e.g. rear front sides top bottom and in the interior of the fleet vehicle e.g. facing the driver facing the cargo facing the road ahead . In one embodiment a camera may be mounted on the top and back of the fleet vehicle and aimed at about a 45 degree angle to view the rear of the fleet vehicle.

The camera as illustrated in FIGS. and A B are designed to be able to be mounted on any motor vehicle including heavy duty fleet vehicles. Accordingly the external housing is made of an alloy material to ensure that the camera is robust. Further since the fleet vehicles are normally cleaned using pressure hoses the camera is designed to have an IP69K rating. Thus the camera is designed to be dust tight as well as withstand high pressure high temperature washes. By preventing the moisture from entering the camera the camera is ensured not to be encumbered by a foggy camera lens or camera protective cover see . It is also contemplated that the external housing can be made of any sufficiently robust material that does not affect the camera s IP69K rating. As shown in the camera may also include a base that is an alloy bracket that is used to mount the camera . In some embodiments the base is included as part of the external housing . As shown in the camera may also include an extended hooded portion to optimize the image captured by the camera . The extended hooded portion may also be used to effectively block out the sun such that the options of positions and placements of the camera on the vehicle are further increased. In some embodiments the extended hooded portion is included as part of the external housing and made of an alloy material.

Referring to the camera comprises a camera processor a camera module including a camera lens a lighting component a dimmer switch a plurality of sensors including an infra red sensor a network interface microphone a chipset and a mirror trigger .

The camera processor is coupled to the camera module the lighting component the dimmer switch the sensors the network interface the microphone the chipset and the mirror trigger . The camera processor may be any processing device including but not limited or restricted to a microprocessor a digital signal processor an application specific integrated circuit a microcontroller a state machine or any type of programmable logic array. In one embodiment the camera processor communicates with the chipset which may be a plurality of integrated circuits IC or chips to control the functions of each of the components of the camera .

The camera module includes a camera lens and an image sensor to capture video data. In some embodiments the camera module is a digital camera that includes High Definition HD Resolution and long range night vision capabilities. For instance the camera module may include a 720P or 1080P HD Resolution and may effectively capture at least 100 feet in distance in night vision mode. The camera lens may be a wide angle lens that provides for example a viewing angle of 170 degrees. The greater horizontal reach of this wide angle lens provides a better viewing coverage. In some embodiments the camera module is provided with a mirror function which changes the video image provided by the camera . When the mirror function is activated the video image provided by the camera is the mirror image of the view as seen by the camera . In the embodiments where the camera is mounted on the rear of the fleet vehicle to view the back of the fleet vehicle the mirror function is normally activated. When the mirror function is deactivated the video image provided by the camera is the view as seen by the camera . In the embodiments where the camera is mounted on the front of the fleet vehicle and facing forward or outward the mirror function is normally deactivated. The mirror function may be activated or deactivated via a mirror trigger . As shown in the mirror trigger may be located on the back side of the camera . In some embodiments the mirror trigger is an external magnetic trigger such that the mirror trigger does not compromise the camera s waterproof integrity. For instance since an external magnet may interact with internal magnets even if the magnets are separated by a wall e.g. housing no holes are required to be made in the housing such that the waterproof integrity of the camera is maintained. In the embodiment illustrated in the back side of the housing includes two threaded sealed holes that are configured to receive a screw magnet which is a screw that includes a magnet. In this embodiment the threaded sealed holes and the screw magnet form the mirror trigger . As shown in each of the threaded sealed holes may have the appearance of a circular indent into the housing and may have threads on the perimeter. In this embodiment the screw magnet may have a disc like shape and the threads of the threaded sealed holes may be coupled to the threads on the screw magnet. In this embodiment when the screw magnet is coupled with the top threaded sealed hole the magnet in the screw magnet interacts with internal magnets to activate the mirror function. Similarly when the screw magnet is coupled with the bottom threaded sealed hole the mirror function is deactivated. In another embodiment the mirror trigger may include a single threaded sealed hole on the housing and when a screw magnet is coupled to the single threaded sealed hole the mirror function is activated and when the screw magnet is not coupled to the single threaded sealed hole the mirror function is deactivated.

As illustrated in a camera protective cover is fitted on an opening on the front side of the external housing and the camera lens is located to face the camera protective cover . With this configuration the camera lens is protected from being damaged by the camera protective cover and the camera module is also able to capture images as seen through the camera protective cover . In some embodiments the camera protective cover is made of glass.

As shown in the lighting component may be a plurality of light emitting diodes LEDs . The lighting component may also having infra red IR capabilities to provide a night vision mode. In some embodiments the night vision mode of the camera allows for up to 100 feet of night vision distance. As illustrated in the lighting component is located to face the camera protective cover . With this configuration when the lighting component is activated it may provide adequate lighting for the video data to be captured by the camera module . Further with this configuration the lighting component may be activated in order for the camera to be in the night vision mode.

As shown in the back side of the camera may include a microphone to receive sounds a transmission medium to transmit the video data captured by the camera module as a live video stream to the network device and a dimmer switch used to control the brightness level of the lighting component . In one embodiment the back side of the camera includes a plurality of openings to provide for the microphone to receive sounds the transmission medium to access the exterior of the camera and the dimmer switch to be accessible. In some embodiments the dimmer switch protrudes from an opening in the back side of the housing and in other embodiments the dimmer switch is flush with the back side of the housing or depressed into the housing . It is contemplated that the dimmer switch may be implemented as for example a push button a touch activated button or a dial to set the desired brightness level of the light component. It is further understood that each of the openings in the housing may be sealed to maintain the waterproof integrity of the camera .

As shown in camera may also include a microphone . In some embodiments based on the location of the camera on the fleet vehicle the microphone s port may be situated on the housing at any location that minimizes the amount of wind resistance that may cause noise interference with the audio recording. For example in the embodiment illustrated in the microphone is located on the back side of the camera to increase the sound quality obtained by the microphone . For instance in embodiments where the camera is mounted facing forward on a fleet vehicle when the fleet vehicle is travelling forward microphone may be shielded from the wind. In another embodiment the microphone may be located on the underside of the housing . The transmission medium may be a wire or Ethernet cord that is coupled to the network interface of the camera and the network device . In one embodiment the network interface is a wired network interface such as an Ethernet interface.

Referring to the camera may comprise the sensors which include for example ambient light sensors sensors for detecting movement position and or orientation e.g. accelerometers gyroscopes etc. In one embodiment the ambient light sensor is used to determine whether the camera is being used in the daytime or nighttime. For instance the ambient light sensor may detect a high level of light and provide a signal to the camera processor indicating this high level of light. Based on this signal the camera processor may automatically deactivate the lighting component given that the lighting component is not needed during the daytime. Similarly the ambient light sensor may detect a low level of light and provide a signal to the camera processor indicating this low level of light. Based on this signal the camera processor may automatically activate the lighting component to place the camera automatically in night vision mode. In some embodiments the lighting component may activate infra red lights in night vision mode.

In one embodiment when the ambient light sensor detects the low light level consistent with nighttime and the camera processor automatically activates the lighting component the user may trigger the dimmer switch once in order to decrease the brightness of the lighting component by a predetermined amount. For example when the camera processor automatically activated the lighting component the default brightness level may be set to 100 . By triggering the dimmer switch once the user may decrease the brightness level to 80 . In some embodiments if the user triggers the dimmer switch a second time the user may further decrease the brightness level to 60 . Accordingly based on repeated triggering of the dimmer switch the user may set the brightness level of the lighting component to the desired level.

In some environmental situations the lighting component being automatically activated to 100 brightness is not desirable. For instance when a truck is driving through a dark rural area the lighting component at 100 brightness may be found to be blinding when the camera is mounted in the interior of the truck. Further in some States garbage trucks are mandated to have a spotlight mounted on rear of the truck for the safety of the worker who is picking up the garbage and riding on the back of the truck. In this situation the spotlight and the lighting component may face each other such that the spotlight and the brightness of the lighting component at 100 brightness may create light reflections that decrease quality of the video captured by the camera . In this embodiment of the invention the dimmer switch allows for the user to customize the brightness of the lighting component accordingly.

In the description certain terminology is used to describe features of the invention. For example in certain situations the terms component unit module and logic are representative of hardware and or software configured to perform one or more functions. For instance examples of hardware include but are not limited or restricted to an integrated circuit such as a processor e.g. a digital signal processor microprocessor application specific integrated circuit a micro controller etc. . Of course the hardware may be alternatively implemented as a finite state machine or even combinatorial logic. An example of software includes executable code in the form of an application an applet a routine or even a series of instructions. The software may be stored in any type of machine readable medium.

An embodiment of the invention may be a machine readable medium having stored thereon instructions which program a processor to perform some or all of the operations described above. A machine readable medium may include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computer such as Compact Disc Read Only Memory CD ROMs Read Only Memory ROMs Random Access Memory RAM and Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM . In other embodiments some of these operations might be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic. Those operations might alternatively be performed by any combination of programmable computer components and fixed hardware circuit components.
