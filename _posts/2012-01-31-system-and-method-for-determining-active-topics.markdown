title: System and method for determining active topics
abstract: A method for determining active topics may include receiving topic information for a document, the information including at least one topic and a weight for each topic, where the topic relates to content of the document, and the weight represents how strongly the topic is associated with the document. User activity information for the document, including a user activity value including at least one of a number of viewers and a number of editors of the document may be received. A topic intensity for each topic may be generated and stored by multiplying the user activity value for the document by the weight of the topic in the document. The topic intensity may be monitored over time. An alert may be generated based on the topic intensity.

Databases may include large quantities of documents including content covering a wide variety of topics. Many different users may simultaneously interact with documents in a database and it may be desirable to identify trending and or active document topics. Given the large quantities of documents however identifying trending and or active topics may be computationally cumbersome.

Briefly aspects of the present disclosure are directed to methods and systems for determining active topics which may include receiving topic information for a document the information including at least one topic and a weight for each topic where the topic relates to content of the document and the weight represents how strongly the topic is associated with the document. User activity information for the document including a user activity value including at least one of a number of viewers and a number of editors of the document may be received. A topic intensity for each topic may be generated and stored by multiplying the user activity value for the document by the weight of the topic in the document. The topic intensity may be monitored over time. An alert may be generated based on the topic intensity.

This SUMMARY is provided to briefly identify some aspects of the present disclosure that are further described below in the DESCRIPTION. This SUMMARY is not intended to identify key or essential features of the present disclosure nor is it intended to limit the scope of any claims.

The term aspects is to be read as at least one aspect . The aspects described above and other aspects of the present disclosure described herein are illustrated by way of example s and not limited in the accompanying figures.

The illustrative aspects are described more fully by the Figures and detailed description. The present disclosure may however be embodied in various forms and is not limited to specific aspects described in the Figures and detailed description.

The following merely illustrates the principles of the disclosure. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the disclosure and are included within its spirit and scope.

Furthermore all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor s to furthering the art and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.

Moreover all statements herein reciting principles and aspects of the disclosure as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future e.g. any elements developed that perform the same function regardless of structure.

Thus for example it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any block diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative circuitry embodying the principles of the disclosure. Similarly it will be appreciated that any flow charts flow diagrams state transition diagrams pseudocode and the like represent various processes which may be substantially represented in computer readable medium and so executed by a computer or processor whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown.

In there is shown a flow diagram which defines steps of a method according to aspects of the present disclosure. Methods and systems of the present disclosure may be implemented using for example a computer system as depicted in or any other system and or device.

In operation a document signature and user activity information for a document may be received by for example system . A document signature e.g. topic information signature information may include for example at least one topic and a weight for each topic. Topic s may for example relate to content and or text of a document and a weight for a topic may for example represent how strongly the topic is associated with the document.

Documents discussed herein may include document text or content. Document text may be for example a text based representation of a document. The document may include text e.g. a word processing document text file portable document format pdf spreadsheet or presentation or may have text associated therewith such as in a transcript when the document is a video e.g. a web based video or any other type of video an audio file e.g. an audio recording podcast or any type of audio or another type of electronically stored file. Document text may be present in a document text file separate from the document. In that case the document text file may be linked to and or stored with the document and or may be stored separately. It will be understood that operations involving the text of a document may be performed on or with the document or the document text file depending on the location of text.

Topics may be for example categories abstract ideas subjects things and or concepts representing the content or subject matter of a document. Topics may be for example an abstract notion of what a document text pertains to is related to or is about. A topic may in some aspects be a concept that at least a portion of the document is about. A topic may or may not be a term present in a document text but may be for example associated with one or more terms present in a document and may be generated by natural language processing or other processes based on one or more terms in a document and or other information. For example a document may include text about cars planes and boats all of which appear as terms verbatim in the document. More abstractly however it may be determined that the document is about vehicles and modes of transportation. Topics associated with the document may therefore be vehicles modes of transportation and or other topics.

A weight e.g. a topic weight or confidence score may represent how strongly a topic is associated with a document e.g. document text . A weight may be for example a percentage e.g. between 0 and 100 a numeric value e.g. between 0 and 1.0 or any other range a vector a scalar or another parameter which quantifies or represents how strongly a topic is associated with a document. For example a document may include text or information relating to one or more topics and a weight associated with each topic may represent or quantify how much a document text pertains to is about or is related to each topic. A sum of weights for all topics associated with a document may for example be equal to 1.0 100 or another value.

User activity information for a document may include a user activity value including at least one of a number of editors a number of viewers and possibly a number of other types of users of a document. An editor of a document e.g. a document editor editor may be for example a user who alters modifies changes creates and or deletes a document. An editor may for example add remove alter modify or change information content and or text in a document. An editor may be for example a document author creator moderator and or owner. An editor may be for example a user with permission or access to modify alter or change a document and or who is for example modifying the document. In some aspects an editor may be a user who has modified a document within a predetermined period of time e.g. within one week or any other period of time .

A viewer of a document e.g. a document viewer or viewer may be an active document user who does not modify alter and or change a document e.g. document text . A viewer of a document may be for example a user is viewing the document who is reading the document who is scrolling through the document who has the document open and or who is otherwise interacting with the document. A viewer may in some aspects be a document user who has permission and or access to read a document e.g. basic permission s but does not have permission and or access to modify alter or change the document.

In operation a snapshot may be created. A snapshot may represent a current state of a system e.g. system database e.g. including one or more documents in one more sets documents and or device. A snapshot may include for example information or data related to one more documents e.g. user activity information topic information and or other information for the documents measured recorded and or received at a point in time an instant in time over a period of time e.g. a time window window of time over a timeframe and or over a time interval. A predetermined point in time period of time and or a time interval may be defined by for example a user system and or another system or device. Snapshots may be created measured taken and or received at predetermined time intervals. For example a snapshot may be created every minute hour or any other time interval. Snapshots may in some aspects be generated by sampling and or measuring information relating to a document e.g. user activity information document signature information at a predetermined sample rate over an interval of time e.g. 2 hours 1 day 30 minutes or any other time interval . Snapshots may in some aspects be average values of information relating to a document e.g. user activity information document signature information measured over an interval of time e.g. 2 hours 1 day 30 minutes or any other time interval .

A snapshot may include information relating to a document including one or more topic weights user activity information for the document and or other information associated with or related to the document. Activity information for a document may include a user activity value including a number of active document users.

In operation a set of documents may be selected from a plurality of documents e.g. a larger set of documents . A selection of a set of a plurality of documents may be received by for example system . A selection of a subset of documents may be generated in response to user input input from system and or input from another system or device. In some aspects a subset of a plurality of documents may be selected in a screening and or filtering process based on document topics document attributes e.g. characteristics profile location or other information relating to viewers editors and or users of the document and or other parameters.

In operation an intensity calculation may be built generated or computed for the set of documents. A topic intensity for topics in a document and or set of documents may be generated and stored. A topic intensity for a topic may be generated by multiplying a user activity value e.g. a number of viewers a number of editors and or other users of a document for a document by a weight of the same topic in the document. A topic intensity may be stored for example in system or another device or system. Each topic in a document may be generated and stored. Topic intensities for each topic in each document in a set and or subset of documents may be generated and stored. Any number of topic intensities for any number of documents may therefore be generated and stored in for example system or another system or device.

In operation results may be monitored and output to for example a user a component of system or another system or device. Results may include for example trending topics topic intensity values identities of subsets of documents document characteristics user characteristics and or representation s thereof. Topic intensity may be monitored by for example comparing topic intensities to a threshold topic intensity. Topic intensity for each topic in one or more documents in a set of documents may be monitored. Topic intensity may be monitored over time by comparing a rate of change of topic intensity for a topic to a threshold topic intensity rate of change.

Topic intensity for a topic a rate of change of topic intensity for a topic and or other topic intensity related information may be output to a user a component of system and or another system. In some aspects a representation of topic intensity for a topic rate of change of topic intensity for a topic and or topic intensity information may be output. A representation may be for example a list a graphical representation e.g. a graphical model graph plot bar graph pie chart or other graphical representation a word cloud or other type of data representing or including topics and or corresponding topic intensities.

In some aspects an alert may be generated based on a topic intensity. An alert e.g. an alarm warning signal or other type of alert may for example be a visual alert e.g. a text alert a window a pop up window flashing text colors a picture icon or other type of visual alert audible alert e.g. an alarm audio signal text to speech TTS auditory icon earcon spearcon or other type of audio alert and or other type of alert. An alert may include for example a list of one or more topics and or corresponding topic intensities a representation of one or more topics and or topic intensities or other information. An alert may for example be output from system .

In some aspects an alert may be generated when a topic intensity for one topic reaches a threshold level and or changes at a threshold rate. A topic intensity for a topic may reach a topic intensity threshold level if for example the topic intensity is equal to or greater than the topic intensity threshold. Similarly a rate of change of topic intensity may change at threshold rate if a rate of change of topic intensity is equal to or greater than a threshold rate of change of topic intensity e.g. a threshold rate .

A threshold topic intensity e.g. a threshold level may be a fixed topic intensity threshold e.g. a predetermined topic intensity threshold a static topic intensity threshold an automatically generated topic intensity threshold e.g. a varying topic intensity threshold or any other type of topic intensity threshold. A fixed topic intensity threshold may be generated by for example a user system or any other system or process. A fixed topic intensity threshold may be based for example on historical topic intensity data user preferences desired system sensitivity or other parameters.

An automatically generated topic intensity threshold level may be for example generated based on one or more stored topic intensities e.g. historical topic intensity data . An automatically generated topic intensity threshold level may be for example a maximum minimum average mean and or mode of stored topic intensity values over a period of time. For example an automatically generated topic intensity threshold may be an average of stored topic intensity values over a period of one month one day two hours or any other period of time e.g. prior to generation of the topic intensity threshold .

A threshold topic intensity rate of change e.g. a threshold rate may be a fixed topic intensity threshold rate e.g. a predetermined topic intensity threshold rate a static topic intensity rate threshold an automatically generated topic intensity threshold e.g. a varying topic intensity threshold rate or any other type of topic rate intensity threshold. A topic intensity rate threshold may be generated by for example a user system or any other system or process.

An automatically generated threshold rate may be for example a maximum average mean and or mode of stored topic intensity rates e.g. stored topic intensity rates for a topic over a period of time.

In some aspects a short term average of topic intensity values may be compared to a long term average or topic intensity values using a short term average long term average STA LTA approach. An alert may be generated and output if the comparison exceeds a predetermined threshold topic intensity. A short term average of topic intensity values may be for example an average of topic intensity values over a relatively short small or brief time window e.g. 1 minute . A long term average of topic intensity values may be for example an average of topic intensity values over a relatively long large or extended time window e.g. 1 day 1 month etc. . If a difference and or absolute value of a difference between a short term average of topic intensity values and a long term average of topic intensity values exceeds a threshold topic intensity an alert may be generated based on the topic intensity and may be output to user.

In some aspects a short term average of topic intensity rates may be compared to a long term average of topic intensity rates using an STA LTA approach. If a difference and or absolute value of a difference between a short term average of topic intensity rates of change and a long term average of topic intensity rates of change exceeds a threshold rate an alert may be generated based on the topic intensity and may be output to user.

In some aspects a viewer alert may be generated. A viewer alert may be generated based for example on a viewer topic intensity for each topic in a document. A viewer topic intensity for a topic may include for example a product of a viewer activity value for a document and a weight of that topic in the document. A viewer activity value may include for example a number of viewers of the document a number of active viewers of the document within a period of time and or other document viewer related information. A viewer alert may be generated if and or when a viewer topic intensity for a topic reaches a threshold level or changes at a threshold rate. A viewer alert may be an audible alert a visual alert or any other type of alert. A viewer alert may be output for example to a user a component of system or another system or device.

In some aspects an editor alert may be generated. An editor alert may be generated based for example on an editor topic intensity for each topic in a document set of documents and or subset of documents. An editor topic intensity for a topic may include for example a product of an editor activity value for a document and a weight of that topic in the document. An editor activity value may include for example a number of editors of the document a number of active editors of the document within a period of time and or other document editor related information. An editor alert may be generated if and or when an editor topic intensity for a topic reaches a threshold level or changes at a threshold rate. An editor alert may be an audible alert a visual alert or any other type of alert. An editor alert may be output for example to a user a component of system or another system or device.

In some aspects one or more trending topics may be determined based on monitored topic intensity. Trending topics e.g. spiking topics hot topics significant topics may include for example topics associated with a topic intensity rate of change above a predetermined threshold rate e.g. a fixed threshold rate varying threshold rate . Topics associated with a rate of change above a threshold rate may be determined for example by comparing a rate of change of topic intensity over time period to threshold topic intensity rate of change using an STA LTA approach or using other methods. Using an STA LTA approach if a difference and or absolute value of a difference between a short term average of topic intensity values and a long term average of topic intensity values exceeds a threshold it may be determined that a topic associated with the topic intensity is a spiking hot significant and or trending topic.

In some aspects an identity of one or more subsets of documents associated with at least one trending topic may be output to a user. A subset of documents associated with a trending topic may be for example a subset or set of documents including one or more documents that include document text and or content including the trending topic.

According to some aspects one or more common attributes associated with a subset of documents may be identified. For example one or more common attributes associated with a subset of documents including at least one trending topic may be identified. Attributes associated with a document or subset of documents may include for example user characteristics properties traits demographics and or other information related to user. User characteristics may be for example an age gender location occupation job title or any other information relating to a document user e.g. a document editor viewer or other type of user . Attributes may include document characteristics e.g. type of document file format document security or other characteristics . Attributes may include attributes of system s used to interact with document e.g. operating system computer type mobile device type or other system attributes . Common attributes may be for example attributes that are common to one or more documents in a set and or subset of documents. Common attributes may for example be output to a user e.g. using a component of system .

In some aspects common attributes may for example be identified in response to a user request regarding a target or query topic. For example a user may request attributes of users e.g. gender age range and occupation actively using e.g. viewing editing or otherwise using documents related to a topic e.g. politics . In response to a request attributes of users e.g. gender age range and occupation actively using document related to the topic may be identified and or output to the user. For example an age range gender percentage and top five occupations of all users actively using documents including content about politics may be identified and or output to the user.

In there is shown a diagram of document signatures according to aspects of the present disclosure. One or more documents e.g. Document 1 Document 2 Document 3 may include one or more topics e.g. Document 1 topics Document 2 topics Document 3 topics . A document signature e.g. a topic information including for example topics e.g. Document 1 topics Document 2 topics and Document 3 topics and a weight for each topic may be received at predefined time intervals e.g. times T 0 T 1 T 2 and or other time intervals . Time interval s may be determined and or set based on user input system settings system activity levels e.g. a number of documents being used edited viewed etc. or other parameters.

In this example document signatures for Document 1 Document 2 Document 3 may be calculated at time zero e.g. T 0 . A document signature for Document 1 at a time zero e.g. T 0 including topics and weights associated with each topic may be received at for example system . A document signature for Document 1 at time zero may include topic A and weight for topic A e.g. 0.70 as well as topic B and a weight for topic B e.g. 0.30 . A document signature for Document 1 at time T 0 including a weight for topic A of 0.70 and a weight for topic B of 0.30 may indicate that Document 1 includes text of which 30 is about or pertains to topic A and 70 about topic B .

A document signature for Document 2 at a time T 0 e.g. time zero including topics and weights associated with each topic may be received at for example system . A document signature for Document 2 at time zero may include topic B topic C and topic D as well as a weight for topic B e.g. 0.05 a weight for topic C e.g. 0.95 a weight for topic D e.g. zero . A document signature for Document 2 at time T 0 including a weight for topic B of 0.05 a weight for topic C of 0.95 and a weight for topic D of 0.0 may indicate that Document 2 at T 0 includes text which is 5 about topic B 95 about topic C and 0 about topic D.

A document signature for Document 3 at a time T 0 e.g. time zero including a topic and a weight associated with the topic may be received at for example system . A document signature for Document 3 at time zero e.g. T 0 may include topic C and a weight for topic C e.g. 1.0 . A document signature for Document 3 at time T 0 including a weight for topic C of 1.0 may indicate that Document 3 at T 0 includes text which is 100 or entirely about topic C .

Document signatures for Document 1 Document 2 Document 3 may be calculated at a second time referred to here as time one e.g. T 1 . A second time or time one e.g. T 1 may occur any amount interval and or period of time after T 0 e.g. T 1 may be 1 hour 20 minutes 2 days or any other amount of time after T 0 . A document signature for Document 1 at time one e.g. T 1 including topics and weights associated with each topic may be received at for example system . A document signature for Document 1 at a time one e.g. T 1 may include topic A and weight for topic A e.g. 0.50 as well as topic B and a weight for topic B e.g. 0.50 . A document signature for Document 1 at time T 1 including a weight for topic A of 0.50 and a weight for topic B of 0.50 may indicate that Document 1 includes text of which 50 e.g. half is about or pertains to topic A and 50 e.g. half pertains to topic B . Between time zero e.g. T 0 and time one e.g. T 1 Document 1 may be modified e.g. by a document editor to remove content relating to topic A and or add content related to topic B . Between time zero e.g. T 0 and time one e.g. T 1 a percentage of Document 1 content about topic A may be reduced from 70 to 50 and a percentage of Document 1 content about topic B may be increased from 30 to 50 

Topic weights e.g. topic A and topic B may represent a percentage and or amount of document text that pertains to a topic therefore the fact that a topic weight decreases may not necessarily indicate that content relating to that topic has been removed from the document but may indicate that content relating to other topics has been added. Similarly the fact that a topic weight increases may not necessarily indicate that content relating to that topic has been added to document but may indicate that content related to other topics has been removed.

A document signature for Document 2 at a time one e.g. T 1 including topics and weights associated with each topic may be received at for example system . A document signature for Document 2 at time one e.g. T 1 may include topic B topic C and topic D as well as a weight for topic B e.g. 0.30 a weight for topic C e.g. 0.60 a weight for topic D e.g. 0.10 . A document signature for Document 2 at a time T 1 including a weight for topic B of 0.30 a weight for topic C of 0.60 and a weight for topic D of 0.10 may indicate that Document 2 at T 1 includes text which is 30 about topic B 60 about topic C and 10 about topic D . Between time zero e.g. T 0 and time one e.g. T 1 Document 2 may be modified e.g. by a document editor to add content relating to topic B remove content related to topic C and or add content related to topic D such that a percentage of Document 2 content about topic A is increased from 5 to 30 a percentage content about topic C is decreased from 95 to 60 and content about topic D is added e.g. increased from 0 to 10 between time zero e.g. T 0 and time one e.g. T 1 . Another possible reason for the addition of topic D to Document 2 at T 1 is that new topics may be added and or topic definitions may change. For example topic D may have been created or redefined between T 0 and T 1 so that topic D applies to Document 2.

A document signature for Document 3 at a time one e.g. T 1 including a topic and weights associated with the topic may be received at for example system . A document signature for Document 3 at time one e.g. T 1 may include topic C and a weight for topic C e.g. 1.0 . Document 3 may be unchanged between time zero and time one.

Document signatures for Document 1 Document 2 Document 3 may be calculated at a third point moment instant or interval in time time two e.g. T 2 . A document signature for Document 1 e.g. including topics and weights for each topic at time T 2 including a weight for topic A of 0.30 and a weight for topic B of 0.70 may indicate that Document 1 includes text which is 30 about topic A and 70 about topic B . A document signature for Document 2 e.g. including topics and weights for each topic at a time T 2 including a weight for topic B of 0.50 a weight for topic C of 0.30 and a weight for topic D of 0.20 may indicate that Document 2 at T 2 includes text which is 50 about topic B 30 about topic C and 20 about topic D . A document signature for Document 3 e.g. including topic s and weight s for each topic at time two e.g. T 2 may include topic C and a weight for topic C e.g. 1.0 . Document 3 may be unchanged between time zero and time two.

Document signatures for Document 1 Document 2 Document 3 may of course be received calculated or measured at any number of points moments instants and or intervals in time time N e.g. T N . Time may for example be determined by a user based on system activity based on a number of active documents and or other parameters.

A snapshot at time zero e.g. T 0 may include information related to Document 1 Document 2 and Document 3 . Information related to documents may include topic information e.g. including topics and associated weights for each topic and user activity information e.g. a number of active users for each document .

A snapshot at time zero e.g. T 0 may include Document 1 topic information and Document 1 activity information . At a time zero e.g. T 0 Document 1 topic information may indicate that Document 1 includes 70 e.g. 0.70 content related to a topic A and 30 e.g. 0.30 content related to a topic B. At time zero e.g. T 0 Document 1 activity information may indicate that Document 1 has five active users e.g. editors viewers and or other type of users .

A snapshot at time zero e.g. T 0 may include Document 2 topic information and Document 2 activity information . At time zero e.g. T 0 Document 2 topic information may indicate that Document 2 includes 5 e.g. 0.05 content related to a topic B and 95 e.g. 0.95 content related to a topic C. At time zero e.g. T 0 Document 2 activity information may indicate that Document 2 has two active users.

A snapshot at time zero e.g. T 0 may include Document 3 topic information and Document 3 activity information . At time zero e.g. T 0 Document 3 topic information may indicate that Document 1 includes 100 e.g. 1.0 content related to a topic C.

A topic intensity for each topic e.g. in a subset of documents may be generated and stored. A topic intensity for each topic in a subset of documents may be generated and stored at predetermined time intervals. For example topic intensity for topics in a document set at T 0 topic intensity at T 1 and topic intensity at T 2 may be generated and stored. Topic intensity points or values for one or more topics in a subset of documents e.g. Document 1 and Document 2 may be generated. Topic intensity points or values for a topic may be generated by for example multiplying a user activity value for a document by a weight of the topic in the document.

Topic intensity values for documents in a document set at time zero e.g. T 0 including a Topic A intensity a Topic B intensity a Topic C intensity and Topic D intensity may be generated and stored. A topic intensity for a topic e.g. a topic intensity value for Topic A Topic B Topic C or Topic D may be a sum of products of a user activity for each document e.g. in a document subset and a weight of that topic in that document. A topic intensity for Topic A e.g. 3.5 at time T 0 may be for example a sum of a product of a Document 1 user activity value e.g. 5 users and a weight of Topic A in Document 1 e.g. 0.70 and a Document 2 user activity value e.g. 2 users and a weight of Topic A in Document 2 e.g. 0.0 . A weight of a topic in a document equal to zero may for example indicate that zero percent e.g. 0 and or none of that document is about that topic. A topic intensity for Topic B e.g. 1.6 at time T 0 may be for example a sum of a product of a Document 1 user activity value e.g. 5 users and a weight of Topic B in Document 1 e.g. 0.30 and a product of a Document 2 user activity value e.g. 2 users and weight of topic B in Document 2 e.g. 0.05 . Similarly a topic intensity for Topic C e.g. 1.9 at time T 0 and a topic intensity for Topic D e.g. 0.0 may be generated. A topic intensity of value of zero e.g. topic intensity for Topic D may for example indicate that no documents in a subset of documents e.g. Document 1 and Document 2 include content related to that topic e.g. Topic D A topic intensity of value of zero may also indicate that no users e.g. zero are viewing documents including content related to that topic.

Topic intensity values for documents in a document set at time one e.g. T 1 including a topic A intensity a topic B intensity a topic C intensity and topic D intensity may be generated and stored. A topic intensity for Topic A e.g. 2.0 at time T 1 may be for example a sum of a product of a Document 1 user activity value e.g. 5 users and a weight of Topic A in Document 1 e.g. 0.4 and a Document 2 user activity value e.g. 3 users and a weight of Topic A in Document 2 e.g. 0.0 . A topic intensity for Topic B e.g. 3.9 at time T 1 may be for example a sum of a product of a Document 1 user activity value e.g. 5 users and a weight of Topic B in Document 1 e.g. 0.60 and a product of a Document 2 user activity value e.g. 3 users and weight of topic B in Document 2 e.g. 0.30 . Similarly a topic intensity for Topic C e.g. 1.8 at time T 1 and a topic intensity for Topic D e.g. 0.3 may be generated.

Topic intensity values for documents in a document set at time two e.g. T 2 including a Topic A intensity a Topic B intensity a Topic C intensity and Topic D intensity may be generated and stored. A topic intensity for Topic A e.g. 3.3 at time T 2 may be for example a sum of a product of a Document 1 user activity value e.g. 11 users and a weight of Topic A in Document 1 e.g. 0.3 and a Document 2 user activity value e.g. 8 users and a weight of Topic A in Document 2 e.g. 0.0 . A topic intensity for Topic B e.g. 11.7 at time T 2 may be for example a sum of a product of a Document 1 user activity value e.g. 11 users and a weight of Topic B in Document 1 e.g. 0.70 and a product of a Document 2 user activity value e.g. 8 users and weight of topic B in Document 2 e.g. 0.50 . Similarly a topic intensity for Topic C e.g. 2.4 at time T 2 and a topic intensity for Topic D e.g. 1.6 may be generated.

Topic A intensity may for example decrease between time T 0 and T 1 e.g. from 3.5 to 2.0 from and may increase between time T 1 and time T 2 e.g. from 2.0 to 3.3 . Topic A intensity may remain relatively constant between time T 0 and T 2 indicating steady user e.g. editor viewer or other user interest in Topic A and that Topic A is likely not a trending topic.

Topic B intensity may for example increase between time T 0 and time T 1 e.g. 1.6 to 3.9 . Topic B intensity may increase at high rate between time T 1 and time T 2 e.g. 3.9 to 11.7 . A change in Topic B intensity between T 1 and T 2 may for example indicate that Topic B is a trending topic. The rate of increase in topic B interest may for example exceed a threshold intensity rate. For example a predetermined threshold rate may be five e.g. 5 topic intensity points per time step and Topic B intensity may increase at rate of 7.8 e.g. 7.8 topic intensity points per time step 11.7 points 3.9 points 1 time step between time T 1 and T 2. Because topic B intensity increases at a rate e.g. 7.8 intensity points per time step above a predefined threshold rate e.g. 5 intensity points per time step Topic B may be determined to be a trending topic. An identity of Topic B and or a subset of documents e.g. Document 1 and Document 2 associated with Topic B a trending topic may for example be output to a user system or other system or device.

Topic C intensity may for example decrease slightly between time T 0 and time T 1 e.g. from 1.9 to 1.8 and may increase slightly between time T 1 and time T 2 e.g. from 1.8 to 2.4 . Topic C intensity between time T 0 and T 2 may be relatively constant indicating that Topic C is likely not a trending topic.

Topic D intensity may for example increase slightly between time T 0 and time T 1 e.g. from 0.0 to 0.3 and may increase slightly between time T 1 and time T 2 e.g. from 0.3 to 1.6 . Topic D intensity between time T 0 and T 2 may be relatively constant indicating that Topic D is likely not a trending topic.
