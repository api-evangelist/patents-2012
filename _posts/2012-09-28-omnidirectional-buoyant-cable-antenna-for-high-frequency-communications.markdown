title: Omnidirectional buoyant cable antenna for high frequency communications
abstract: The invention is a buoyant cable antenna that is towed on the surface of a body of water by a submerged underwater vehicle to allow communication coverage in an omnidirectional pattern in the VHF frequency range and that is also compatible with existing buoyant cable antenna deployment and retrieval systems. The antenna of the present invention comprises a floating cable having four identical antenna elements that are arranged in a cross configuration. The antenna is designed with a system of four shielded inductor units connected in series with the antenna elements to reduce the losses to seawater by the submerged elements and to tune the exposed vertical element and its feed-cable capacitance to resonance which results in greatly increased radiated power at the design frequency of approximately 10-30 MHz.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates to antennas for use with an underwater vehicle and more specifically to a buoyant cable antenna that is towed by a submerged underwater vehicle to allow communication coverage in an omnidirectional pattern in the frequency range of 10 MHz to 30 MHz that is preferably compatible with existing buoyant cable antenna deployment and retrieval systems.

Radio frequency communication for submerged underwater vehicles is currently limited to unidirectional signal coverage. Buoyant cable antenna systems consisting of a single floating horizontal antenna element together with a floating transmission line have been and are currently in use that provide for the type of radio frequency communication described above. Unfortunately unidirectional signal coverage provides limited utility. The radiation efficiency of the current buoyant cable antennas is very low since the horizontal antenna element which is partially immersed in seawater encounters wave tilt in order to radiate the vertically polarized signal necessary for surface wave propagation of the signal. What is needed is a buoyant cable antenna that provides a radiation pattern that is omnidirectional in azimuth.

It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide omnidirectional signal coverage both transmit and receive capability for submerged underwater vehicles through the use of a buoyant cable antenna that is towed on the surface of the water using antenna elements that are electrically much smaller than the optimum one half wavelength size.

It is a further object to provide an antenna that greatly reduces the amount of wasted radio signal power that would normally be lost to seawater.

It is another object of the invention to provide an electrical apparatus that maximizes the radiated power of one or more electrically short antenna elements.

It is another object of the invention to have one vertical component of the antenna perpendicular to the ocean surface at all times.

These objects are accomplished through the use of a buoyant cable antenna with a vertical antenna component that eliminates signal null areas. The antenna of the present invention comprises a floating cable having four identical antenna elements that are arranged in a cross configuration. The antenna elements are attached to and protrude from the floating cable. While floating on the water surface the antenna may rotate freely with minimal signal loss with one antenna element always extended above and perpendicular to the water s surface. Omni directional coverage is achieved by the vertical posture of one of the antenna elements. The antenna employs a series of shielded inductor units such that each inductor unit is placed in series with each antenna element to reduce the losses to seawater by the submerged elements and to tune the exposed vertical element and its feed cable capacitance to resonance which results in greatly increased radiated power at the design frequency of approximately 10 30 MHz.

Referring to the present invention teaches a buoyant cable antenna that is towed by a submerged underwater vehicle not shown as the antenna floats on the surface of the water . The antenna is electrically connected to the underwater vehicle via a coaxial cable transmission line . The antenna is composed of three sections 1 an encapsulating cylindrical encasement 2 a buoyant section comprising a cable made of polyethylene foam that provides the buoyancy in seawater and 3 four identical antenna elements that are attached to and protrude from encasement .

In a preferred embodiment encasement is made from a potting compound such as a thermo setting plastic or a silicone rubber gel that is water tight flexible tear resistant and meets the tensile requirements for towing a buoyant cable antenna at specified speeds as well as deployment and retrieval by the BRA 24 system. In a preferred embodiment encasement encapsulates the electronics of the antenna . In a preferred embodiment buoyant section is a cable made of polyethylene foam that provides the buoyancy in seawater. Encasement is joined to buoyant section . In a preferred embodiment the diameter of encasement and buoyant section is 0.65 inch allowing them to conform to the required dimensions of the BRA 24 system.

The antenna elements are held in place by the potting compound of encasement . The four identical antenna elements are arranged symmetrically around the encasement in a cross configuration. In operation at least one element is extended vertically above and perpendicular to the water surface when the antenna is deployed regardless of rotations even as the antenna moves along the surface of the water .

In a preferred embodiment each antenna element is essentially a wire extension of the center conductor of one of four insulated coaxial wires with the coaxial shielding terminated. The end of each of the insulated coaxial wires along with the center conductor connection junction to the wire extension antenna element is insulated to prevent water passing into the insulated coaxial wire . Each of the four wire extension antenna elements is secured respectively to one of four three feet long cylindrical dielectric support rods . In a preferred embodiment cylindrical support rods are fabricated of fiber glass having a diameter of one eighth of an inch. However the invention is not constrained by the choice of fabrication material and diameter only length. In an alternative embodiment the rods are fabricated of electrically conducting material that serve as the actual radiators and are electrically connected directly to the insulated coaxial wires .

Referring to there is illustrated a preferred embodiment of the electronics consisting of a system of four shielded inductor units electrically connected at one end to transmission line originating from the towing vessel and electrically connected at the opposite end to the four insulated coaxial wires such that a single shielded inductor unit is placed in series with a single insulated coaxial wires that are connected to the four antenna elements .

The purpose of the shielded inductor unit system is twofold 1 each shielded inductor unit generates 1.7 micro Henrys of inductance and provides a reactance in series with each antenna element that greatly reduces the losses to seawater by the submerged elements 2 the shielded inductor unit associated with the vertical in air antenna element serves to tune this exposed antenna element and its feed cable capacitance to resonance which results in greatly increased radiated power at the design frequency of approximately 16 MHz.

In a preferred embodiment each shielded inductor unit is fabricated from two inductors preferably with iron powder magnetic cores placed in series such that the combined inductors generate a preferred inductance in the range of 1 2 micro Henrys. The two joined inductors are encased in an electrically insulating cylindrical housing made of a dielectric material that is in turn enveloped by shielding consisting primarily of a low loss conductor material. The design of the shielded inductor units is essentially a coaxial arrangement that is necessitated in order to prevent electrical losses by the antenna operating environment of seawater.

In one embodiment the inductors are manufactured by Miller Corporation and consist of two model 5800 3R9 RC each with all but the first layer of turns removed placed in series. Each pair of inductors is wrapped in 0.020 inch thick cardboard to physically stabilize the components and provide impact protection. The wrapped pair of inductors is placed inside a 0.020 inch thick polyvinylchloride PVC housing of 1.38 inches in length with a 0.335 inch outer diameter which serves as the electrically insulating housing. The outside of the PVC housing is then encased in a copper shell which serves as the low loss conductor shielding .

The shielding of the inductor units is electrically connected to the shields of the insulated coaxial wire while the center conductor of each insulated coaxial wire is connected directly to the inductor pair . The inductor units are arranged in tandem inside of encasement . The shielding prevents the loss of current due to capacitance between the inductors windings and the RF voltage from the surrounding seawater.

The advantages of the present invention are that the antenna allows communication coverage in an omnidirectional pattern with improved antenna gain at high frequencies. An advantage of the use of inductors is a reduction in loss due to submerged antenna elements . The inductors serve as a passive device to reduce current flow to the submerged antenna elements . The use of the shielding around each inductor reduces the capacitive coupling of the inductors with the seawater. Finally the use of inductors to tune the exposed antenna element to resonance greatly increases the antenna gain compared to a non resonant system.

In light of the above it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
