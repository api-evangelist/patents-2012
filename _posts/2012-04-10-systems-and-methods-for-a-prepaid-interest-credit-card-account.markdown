This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 251 679 filed Oct. 15 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 156 043 and is also related by subject matter to the embodiments disclosed in the following commonly assigned applications U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 251 693 filed Oct. 15 2008 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 251 703 filed Oct. 15 2008 each entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR A PREPAID INTEREST CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT . The disclosure of each application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Credit card holders are influenced to pay off their monthly balance in order to avoid interest fees which in turn limits interest based revenue. However many credit card holders may choose to carry a balance if the economic incentives were available. Lacking credit card holders that carry balances month to month results in lost fees and interest to credit card companies. Currently many credit cards charge an annual fee but this fee is not tied to any interest rate or credit limit on the credit card account. Thus this fee is the same for all card holders regardless of their credit limit and provides little incentive for credit card holders to carry a balance.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

By way of example and not limitation illustrates remote application programs as residing on the remote memory storage device . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.

It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or where appropriate with a combination of both. Thus the methods and apparatus of the embodiments or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the embodiments. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device generally includes a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the processes described in connection with the embodiments e.g. through the use of an application programming interface API reusable controls or the like. Such programs are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

Although exemplary embodiments may refer to utilizing aspects of the embodiments in the context of one or more stand alone computer systems the embodiments are not so limited but rather may be implemented in connection with any computing environment such as a network or distributed computing environment. Still further aspects of the embodiments may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Such devices might include personal computers network servers handheld devices supercomputers or computers integrated into other systems such as automobiles and airplanes.

Referring next to shown is an exemplary networked computing environment in which many computerized processes may be implemented to perform the processes described below. For example parallel computing may be part of such a networked environment with various clients on the network of using and or implementing a prepaid interest credit card account. One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that networks can connect any computer or other client or server device or in a distributed computing environment. In this regard any computer system or environment having any number of processing memory or storage units and any number of applications and processes occurring simultaneously is considered suitable for use in connection with the systems and methods provided.

Distributed computing provides sharing of computer resources and services by exchange between computing devices and systems. These resources and services include the exchange of information cache storage and disk storage for files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network connectivity allowing clients to leverage their collective power to benefit the entire enterprise. In this regard a variety of devices may have applications objects or resources that may implicate the processes described herein.

This network may itself comprise other computing entities that provide services to the system of and may itself represent multiple interconnected networks. In accordance with aspects of the embodiments each entity and may contain discrete functional program modules that might make use of an API or other object software firmware and or hardware to request services of one or more of the other entities and .

It can also be appreciated that an object such as may be hosted on another computing device . Thus although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs televisions MP3 players etc. software objects such as interfaces COM objects and the like.

There are a variety of systems components and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently many networks are coupled to the Internet which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures whether coupled to the Internet or not may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.

A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client server peer to peer or hybrid architectures. The client is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing a client is a process i.e. roughly a set of instructions or tasks that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to know any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client server architecture particularly a networked system a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer e.g. a server. In the example of any entity and can be considered a client a server or both depending on the circumstances.

A server is typically though not necessarily a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system and the server process may be active in a second computer system communicating with one another over a communications medium thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.

Client s and server s communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer s . For example HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web WWW or the Web. Typically a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol IP address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator URL can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium e.g. client s and server s may be coupled to one another via TCP IP connection s for high capacity communication.

In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in and the further diversification that can occur in computing in a network environment such as that of the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture. Instead the embodiments should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.

A prepaid interest credit card account may involve charging a percentage of the annual interest on the credit limit amount on a credit card upfront and charge no further interest for the remainder of the year. Essentially this allows for a card holder to carry a balance from month to month with no additional interest charges. The card holder can continue with the annualized reduced interest plan or pay the balance amount off at the end of the year. This gives card holders the ability to manage their available capital more fluidly and simplifies the interest process.

Referring next to shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for a prepaid interest credit card account. First a prepaid interest amount is calculated . For example this prepaid interest amount may be a percentage of the total interest amount on a credit card account should the card holder maintain a balance of the credit limit for an entire year. The percentage of interest amount and term may vary. For example the term of the prepaid interest may be less or more than a year and the percentage amount may be 0 and 

If a card holder has opted in or signed up for a prepaid interest credit card account then the prepaid interest amount is charged to the account of the card holder. It is then determined whether it is the end of the monthly billing cycle. If it is not the end of the monthly billing cycle then the process loops back until it is the end of the monthly billing cycle. If it is the end of the monthly billing cycle then it is determined whether the prepaid interest amount has been received yet. If the payment has been received then only the monthly unpaid balance is charged with no interest. If the payment has not been received yet then the unpaid monthly balance is charged to the card holder with interest. The process then loops back to the determination of whether the end of the monthly billing cycle has been reached.

Referring next to shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for a prepaid interest credit card account including year end renewal of prepaid interest. First a prepaid interest amount is calculated as described above. If a card holder has opted in or signed up for a prepaid interest credit card account then the prepaid interest amount is charged to the account of the card holder.

It is then determined whether it is the end of the monthly billing cycle. If it is not the end of the monthly billing cycle then the process loops back until it is the end of the monthly billing cycle. If it is the end of the monthly billing cycle then it is determined whether the prepaid interest amount has been received yet. If the payment has been received then only the monthly unpaid balance is charged with no interest. Then it is determined whether it has been a year since the prepaid interest payment had been received. However a year term is used herein as an example only and other lengths of time may also be used. If it has been a year since the yearly prepaid interest had been received then the yearly prepaid interest amount is calculated for the next year and is charged to the card holder. As an alternative process the card holder may at this point have a choice to opt out of the prepaid interest plan by making a positive indication of such or just by not paying the prepaid interest amount charged to their account. Also if the end of the monthly billing cycle does not coincide with the year long period since the prepaid interest had been received then only the portion of the billing cycle falling within the year long period will be covered by the prepaid interest received. The process then proceeds to the determination of whether the end of the monthly billing cycle has been reached and continues as described above.

It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purpose of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention. While the invention has been described with reference to various embodiments it is understood that the words which have been used herein are words of description and illustration rather than words of limitations. Further although embodiments been described herein with reference to particular means and materials the invention is not intended to be limited to the particulars disclosed herein rather the invention extends to all functionally equivalent structures methods and uses such as are within the scope of the appended claims. Those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings of this specification may effect numerous modifications thereto and changes may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its aspects.
