This application is a continuation in part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 298 961 filed Nov. 17 2011 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present invention is directed to a device and method for injecting media information into a cellular communication.

Devices capable of sending and receiving communications such as phone calls text messages electronic mail instant messaging requests and other electronic updates and information are becoming increasingly prevalent. Such devices come in a wide variety and may be generally stationary such as a desktop computer TV Set Top box static game console etc. or may be easily portable such as a smart phone tablet computer notebook computer personal digital assistant PDA portable game console portable media device etc. Further such devices may send and receive communications through a wide variety of wired or wireless connections standards or protocols such as the Internet an intranet voice over internet protocol VOIP satellite 3G SMS MMS 4G WIMAX etc.

The ability to record audio messages and store these messages in the memory of these devices is widely known. In addition the ability to encode live audio and route the live audio to a network such as a cellular network is also widely known. However current devices do not allow the transmission of stored audio to a cellular network. Accordingly only live audio streams can be uplinked to a cellular network. Because of this gap a mobile communication device is dependent on the network it is connected to for storage of audio messages transmitted from the network such as a voice mail server. This limits the use of audio recordings on cellular devices. Consequently there is a need for device that has the ability to transmit recorded media information to devices on a wireless network.

Various embodiments of the present invention include a message injection apparatus including a memory a processor a connection unit communicatively coupled to a communication device and an application operating in the memory that is configured to receive audio signals from the communication device and to transmit at least one audio signal to the communication unit based on an operational mode

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description in conjunction with the appended claims.

While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described one or more embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered illustrative only of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to any specific embodiment disclosed herein.

The present disclosure is directed to one or more communication devices capable of transmitting an audio signal over a wireless network such as a cellular network to a second device. The transmission of the audio signal may be part of a larger communication management system which is used to notify callers that the user of the mobile communication device is unavailable. The audio signal may be sent as a single transmission or may be appended to another audio signal that was received in real time.

The IO Unit is coupled to a speaker and a microphone via the audio switch unit . The audio switch unit is configured to receive an audio signal from the microphone and to adjust various characteristics of the received audio signal. The audio switch unit may adjust the volume of the audio side tone generation comfort noise generation echo cancelation automatic gain noise suppression tone generation or any other characteristic of the audio signal. The audio switch unit also routes audio signals received by the microphone to the application processing unit or the radio communication unit and also routes audio from the application processing unit and radio communication unit to the speaker .

The radio communication unit includes a radio interface unit a radio daemon unit a radio audio unit and a driver unit operating via the CPU and DSP . The radio audio unit is communicatively coupled to the audio switch unit such that the audio switch unit transmits audio captured by the microphone for transmission over the wireless network by radio hardware coupled to the driver unit . The radio audio unit also transmits audio information received from the radio hardware via the driver unit to the speaker via the audio switch unit .

The radio interface unit performs high level operations to initiate a connection between the mobile device and another device connected to the wireless network via the driver unit . The radio interface unit is also communicatively coupled to a telephony unit in the application processing unit . As an illustrative example the radio interface unit may receive a command from the telephony unit to initiate a phone call between two mobile devices. The radio interface unit communicates with the radio audio unit and driver unit via the radio daemon unit to connect to the wireless network and initiate a call between the two devices. The radio interface unit also communicates with the telephony unit to notify the telephony unit that a phone call has been initiated either by the mobile device or by an external device that is calling the mobile device . The telephony unit communicates with the application running in the application processing unit to provide a status of the radio transmission unit and to initiate actions in the radio transmission unit .

The radio audio unit in the radio communication unit is communicatively coupled to the audio switch unit such that the radio audio unit instructs the audio switch unit to send audio signals from the microphone to the radio audio unit and to transmit audio signals from radio audio unit to the speaker via the audio switch unit . The hardware driver unit is communicatively coupled to the radio hardware in the mobile device such that the hardware driver unit initiates a connection with a wireless network via the radio hardware and controls the transmission and receipt of audio signals onto and from the wireless network. The hardware driver unit is communicatively coupled to the radio audio unit via the radio interface unit and the radio daemon unit such that the radio audio unit provides audio signals from the microphone to the hardware driver unit for transmission over the wireless network. The hardware driver unit also transmits audio signals received from the wireless network to the radio audio unit for transmission to the speaker .

If the radio interface unit returns a status of IN CALL the application directs the audio switch unit to open an audio path between the application and the speaker to transmit a pre assigned ringtone audio signal via the application audio unit to the speaker in step . The audio switch unit closes any open audio connections to the speaker and opens an audio path between the application and the speaker to transmit the pre assigned audio signal to the speaker . While the ringtone audio signal is being transmitted to the speaker the telephony unit requests the caller information from the radio interface unit which is passed to the application for display to a user via the display of the mobile device . The application also presents buttons on the display that ask the user if they would like to accept or decline the incoming call.

If the user accepts the call via the buttons displayed by the application on the display the telephony unit sends a signal to the radio interface unit to initiate the call in step . The radio interface unit initiates a connection to the wireless network via the driver unit and instructs the audio switch unit to open audio paths between the radio interface unit the speaker and microphone . The audio switch unit closes the audio path between the application and the speaker and opens the audio path between the speaker microphone and the radio interface unit via the radio audio unit . Upon termination of the audio path to the application transmission of the ringtone audio signal by the application is terminated. In step the radio interface unit waits for the call to terminate before sending a signal to the telephony unit that the call has ended. Once the call has ended the application returns to step and the audio switch unit closes the audio path between the radio interface unit the speaker and the microphone .

In step if the radio interface unit returns an indication that the phone is AT REST the application opens an audio path between the application and the speaker via the application audio unit and the audio switch unit . In step the application checks the status of the radio interface unit via the telephony unit to confirm the radio interface unit is not receiving a telephone call. While the audio signal is transmitted to the speaker the application checks the status of the radio interface unit via the telephony unit . If the radio interface unit is still AT REST the application transmits the audio signal to the speaker via the application audio unit and the audio switch unit in step . If the radio interface unit transmits an IN CALL flag to the telephony unit the transmission of the audio signal to the speaker stops and the process moves to step . In step the application keeps the audio path open while the audio signal is transmitted to the speaker and the radio interface unit remains at rest and closes the audio path in step when the audio signal transmission is complete.

In step the audio switch unit opens an audio path between the application and the radio interface unit by first closing the audio path between the radio interface unit and the microphone and opening the path between the application and the radio interface unit via the application audio unit and the radio audio unit . In step the application transmits the audio signal through the audio path via the application audio unit . The radio audio unit receives the audio signal from the application audio unit and passes the audio signal through a plurality of filters that prepare the audio signal for transmission over the wireless network via the hardware driver unit . After the audio signal transmission is complete the audio switch unit may close the audio path . The application may also keep the audio path open until the radio interface unit indicates that the call is terminated. If the audio path remains open while the call is active audio received from the wireless network may be sent to the application where it may be saved in the memory or the secondary storage unit of the mobile communications device .

In step the radio interface unit receives the AUTO ANSWER flag and does not request an audio path between the speaker the microphone or the external device . In step the application requests an audio path between the application and the radio interface unit via the application audio unit . In step the audio switch unit opens the audio path and the radio interface unit initiates the call over the opened audio path . The application transmits the audio signal over the audio path through the application audio unit and the radio audio unit after the radio interface unit confirms the call is initiated via the telephony unit and the driver unit receives the audio signal from the radio interface unit via the radio audio unit and transmits the audio signal over the wireless network.

In step the application determines if the audio signal has completely transmitted over the audio path . If the audio signal has completely transmitted the application may request the audio path be closed. The application may also terminate the call by transmitting an END CALL flag from the telephony unit to the radio interface unit . The application may also maintain the audio path until the user of the mobile device receives the call by pressing a button displayed by the application on the display of the mobile communication device . If the user indicates that they would like to receive the call the application transmits an IN CALL flag to the radio interface unit which requests the audio switch unit close audio path and open audio path .

The application may analyze information from additional sources such as a schedule application residing in or external to the mobile communication device global positioning satellite GPS information or any other user specific information to determine if the AUTO ANSWER flag should be turned on. As an illustrative example the application may query a scheduling application on the mobile communication device to determine if the AUTO ANSWER flag should be turned on. The application may transmit the AUTO ANSWER flag to the radio interface unit when a user receives a call when they are in a scheduled event. To determine if the user is in a scheduled event the application may compare the current time and date to a starting and ending time and date in the user s schedule to determine if the event is in progress. If the event is in progress the application will send the AUTO ANSWER flag to the radio interface unit when a call is in coming.

The user may also supply a listing of authorized phone numbers that should not be auto answered during the event. As another illustrative example a user may designate a specific phone number to pass through to the phone during the event such as a family member or a client calling the user. When the indicated phone number is transferred to the telephony unit from the radio interface unit as part of the call information the application will transmit an ACCEPT CALL signal to the radio interface unit instructing the radio interface unit to open the audio path to the speaker and microphone . The application will not open an audio path between the radio interface unit and the speaker if the caller information is not in the list of authorized phone numbers.

The application may also look to multiple pieces of information to determine if the AUTO ANSWER flag should be transmitted to the radio interface unit . As an illustrative example the application may analyze the schedule information and the GPS position of the user to determine if the user is at the location of the meeting. If the user is at the location of the meeting the AUTO ANSWER flag is transmitted to the radio interface unit when a call is incoming. If the user is not at the location indicated by the schedule information the AUTOANSWER is not transmitted.

The application may also automatically open an audio path from the radio audio unit to the speaker when a call from a specific device is received. As an illustrative example the application may receive caller information and an IN CALL flag from the radio interface unit via the telephony unit . The application may compare the received caller information such as the phone number of the device calling in to an authorized list of phone numbers stored in the memory of the mobile communication device and may automatically accept the call and open an audio path to the speaker and microphone when the caller information matches a predefined caller stored in authorized list. Since the audio channel is open on both devices an intercom affect is achieved where both parties can communicate with one another over the wireless network.

The radio audio unit stores audio signals received from the driver unit in the memory and the audio switch unit extracts the stored audio form the memory location and transmits the audio signal to the speaker via the audio path . The audio switch unit receives audio from the microphone and stores the audio from the microphone in the memory location via audio path . The radio audio unit extracts the audio signal from the memory location and transmits the audio signal to the wireless network via the radio interface unit and the driver unit . The radio audio unit also stores audio signals received from the wireless network in memory location . Similarly the external device transmits and extracts audio signals from the memory via audio path . The application audio unit is also coupled to the memory location and is configured to read and write audio signals into the memory location .

In step the application access the memory location where audio transmitted to the wireless network is stored via the application audio unit . The application may transmit a VIRTUAL CALL flag to the audio switch unit which causes the audio switch unit to close the audio path between the microphone and the memory location . The application may also connect to the microphone and prevent the microphone from transmitting an audio signal to the memory .

In step the application routes the audio signal through the application audio unit which formats the audio signal into a format compatible with the radio audio unit and then stores the converted audio signal in the memory . The radio audio unit extracts the audio signal from the memory location and transmits the audio signal over the wireless network via the radio interface unit and the driver unit . In step the application audio unit determines if the audio signal has been successfully stored in the memory location . If the storage is successful the application ends the process. If the storage is not successful the application attempts to store the audio signal a second time.

The application may be communicatively coupled to the external device via the network connection unit using a wireless communication protocol such as Bluetooth. The application may also be communicatively coupled to the external device by a wired data bus such as a universal serial bus USB connection in the external device and in the mobile device . The application may also be communicatively coupled to the external device by a network connection such as a TCP IP connection or Ethernet connection. The application may also be connected to the external device by a cradle that includes a serial or USB connection to the external device the cradle being configured to hold the mobile communication device in a predefined position. The application may also be connected to the external device by an audio adapter on the external device that is configured to engage an audio port on the mobile communication device

After the external device stores the audio file the application monitors the status of the radio interface device via the telephony unit in step . When the radio interface unit transmits an IN CALL status to the telephony unit the application transmits an ACCEPT CALL flag to the radio interface unit causing the radio interface unit to connect the call via the driver unit in step .

In step the application transmits an START TRANSMISSION signal to the external device via an established wireless connection or hard wire connection between the external device as previously discussed. In step the external device transmits the stored audio signal to the radio audio unit via the audio path . The radio audio unit filters the audio signal before sending the audio signal to the wireless network via the radio interface unit and the driver unit . While the example above indicates that the application is operating in the mobile communication device the application may also operate on the external device .

The external device may include a plurality of switches coupled to an input output unit in the external device. An application operating in the memory of the external device monitors the status of each switch and changes the operation of the external device based on the status of the switches. As an illustrative example when a first switch is selected the application may transmit audio signals received from the mobile communication device to a head set coupled to the external device . When a second switch is selected the application may initiate an auto answer mode where the external device transmits audio signals stored in the memory of the external device over the wireless network via the mobile communication device . When a third switch is selected the application may initiate a call conversion mode where audio signals received by the external device are analyzed by an application operating in the memory of the external device . When a fourth switch is selected the application may receive audio signals transmitted from a microphone coupled to the external device convert the audio signals into a digital format and store the audio signals in the memory of the external device . The switches may be push buttons. Further the application may also initiate different modes based on the engagement of a combination of switch.

The external device may also include a display unit . The display unit may be configured to display a menu that allows users to select different modes of operation for the external device . The display unit may also be configured to display information pertaining to the external device and the files stored in the memory of the external device . As an illustrative example the display unit may display a list of recordings stored in the memory of the external device . The display unit may be logically coupled to at least one of the switches such that the selection of a switch will correspond to an action described on the display unit . As another illustrative example the selection of a switch may allow a user to listen to a specific audio file stored in the memory of the external device . The display unit may also display information pertaining to the association of the audio files stored in the memory to different operational modes of the external device .

In the call conversion mode audio signals received from the wireless network or from the microphone coupled to the external device are converted into text using conventional voice recognition software algorithms that are widely known in the art. Examples of voice recognition applications include Dragon Naturally Speaking and Microsoft s Text to Speech. The external device may analyze the converted audio signal for keywords and initiate different modes based on the identified keywords. The user of the mobile communication device may store a list of keywords and associated operating modes in the memory of the external device .

As an illustrative example the external device may receive an audio signal that includes the word emergency. A user of the mobile communication device may previously configure the external device to automatically notify the user of the mobile communication device of any received audio signal including the word emergency by playing an audio tone on the speaker of the mobile communication device . Further the external device may be configured to enter a vehicle mode when an audio signal is received which includes the phrase mobile device is docked in a vehicle. The external device may also be configured to initiate any other operational mode based on a keyword previously identified a user of the mobile communication device .

In a first mode when the switch is engaged the control unit transmits a control signal to the application audio unit by the audio switch unit via audio path . The application audio unit receives the control signal opens an audio path to the radio interface unit and transmits an audio signal stored in the memory of the mobile communication device using any of the previously discussed methods. When the switch is not engaged the control unit passes the audio signal to the right speaker output and the left speaker output . The control unit also transmits audio signals from the microphone to the mobile communication device .

The external device may also be a docking station in a car that allows a user to mount and charge mobile communication device . The external device is configured to identify when a mobile communication device is engaged with the docking. When the mobile communication device is docked in the docking station the control unit transmits a control signal to the application audio unit to transmit audio signals from the memory of the mobile communication unit in response to a received call.
