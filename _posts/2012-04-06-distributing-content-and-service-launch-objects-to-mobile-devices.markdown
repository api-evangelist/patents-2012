Digital user devices communication networks and content choices are proliferating. These devices for example smartphones tablet notebooks PCs etc. come in many different forms most significantly in terms of the mobility UI display and storage capability. Communication network for example WiFi cellular Ethernet etc. parameters change by orders of magnitude in performance and cost. The content available for example movies music games apps is also very heterogeneous in size formats cost etc. The user of a specific user device often is interested in access to a specific content over a specific communications network at a specific time location. Often the size of the content or the speed cost of the communication network make it impractical to access the content resulting in lost revenue for a content provider or a content broker and results is a dissatisfied user.

It is desirable to have methods systems and apparatuses for preloading desired and valued content at an appropriate storage element of an appropriate user device for an appropriate user over an appropriate communication network.

Disclosed herein are methods and apparatuses for distributing content over a network. Also disclosed are methods and apparatuses for providing service launch objects associated with the distributed content wherein a service launch object launches distributed content. In some embodiments a network system manages a plurality of content and assists in preloading at least a portion of the content to a storage element coupled to the content distribution server over a communication network. The network server obtains information to identify a particular portion of a user interface of a wireless device that is communicatively coupled to the network system over a wireless access network. The network server then sends configuration information to the wireless device the configuration information configured to assist the wireless device in placing a service launch object in the particular portion of the user interface wherein the service launch object launches the content.

Other aspects and advantages of the described embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings illustrating by way of example the principles of the described embodiments.

Communication networks also have very different properties and can be utilized in different ways by users. Examples of communication networks include a home network which is wireless home networks such as personal wireless area network for example WPAN Bluetooth IR etc. local wireless area networks for example WLAN WiFi .11a 11b 11n 11ac etc. etc. Typical parameters are local mobility medium bandwidth medium reach or coverage medium reliability very low cost per byte for example is free etc. For example home network is a wired home network such as an Ethernet network a multimedia over cable alliance MOCA network a HomePlug communication over powerline network etc. Typical parameters are no mobility high bandwidth high reliability and low cost per bit. Communication networks could also be access networks. For example access network is a wired copper or cable broadband connection such as asymmetric digital subscriber line ADSL very high speed digital subscriber line VDSL DOCSIS or a fiber connection. Typical parameters are no mobility medium to high bandwidth medium to high reliability flat fee per month of usage. For example access network could also be a fixed wireless broadband connection such as WiMAX. Typical parameters is limited or no mobility medium bandwidth medium reliability etc. For example access network could a wireless mobile network such as 2G 3G 4G GPRS edge HSPA EVDO LTE etc. Typical parameters are high mobility large coverage low to medium bandwidth low to medium reliability flat monthly fee with or without limits or relatively high cost per bit etc. For example a communication network is a point of interest POI access network . A POI is a work office coffee shop restaurant grocery store department store airport school government building etc. Each of these POI networks could have a access network to provide valuable content to user devices. Often these POI access networks are WLAN such as WiFi networks but they is wireless personal area networks WPAN Ethernet etc. Examples of typical parameters comprise medium bandwidth medium reliability local mobility free access one time or limited subscription etc.

A list of relevant parameters may include an identification ID number speed or bandwidth of the communication network for example minimum speed typical speed maximum speed statistics of the speed quality of service QoS QoE etc. monthly rate for access to the communication network service a maximum usage per month a cost of usage above the maximum usage if the network is associated to a single user or a multiuser and connectivity or coverage details etc. For example user has access to a communication network such as home wireless within nominal speed of 50 Mbps no monthly rate no limit on maximum usage no cost above the maximum usage it is multiuser its coverage area is the home etc. For example user also has access to a communication network such as cellular 4G roaming network with nominal speed of 0.5 Mbps a monthly rate of 5 which does not include any free usage per month a cost of 50 per gigabyte associated to a single user typically used at work etc. For example user also has access to a communication network such as a POI WLAN 1 with ID with a nominal speed of 25 Mbps no monthly rate no max usage per month 0 cost per byte intended for multiple users is located at a coffee shop etc. Other examples can be derived from the and many other combinations are possible.

Based on this example table for example home wireless network for example WiFi provides a fast and low cost method to obtain content while at home. This may be the preferred method for delivering moderately large content to portable devices at home. For example cellular 4G roaming provides a moderately slow and very expensive method to obtain content while on the road for example traveling abroad. This may be the preferred method to obtain time critical small content while travelling.

In addition a user device may have no communication network available at a given time. For example a mobile user device with WiFi only connectivity away from a home network or a WiFi hotspot or a mobile user device in an airplane without WiFi may have no communication network available.

Moreover the communication network available may not have the bandwidth or reliability to support content desired by the user. In some embodiments content may be preloaded that cannot reliably be consumed over the communication network. For example high definition HD video content for a large screen TV may require 4 Mbps for a reliable streaming for example real time . The communication network such as home broadband access network may not be able to sustain 4 Mbps over the duration of the video. For example HD video content for smart phone may require 0.5 Mbps for a reliable streaming for example real time . The 4G access network may not be able to sustain 0.5 Mbps over the duration of the video.

This is a heterogeneous set of communication networks that a user may access content with and active management of the content over the communication networks could result in improved value.

For example the Home Gateway may include several modems and networking capabilities communication network parameters such as axDSL broadband access network connection a WLAN modem to connect to mobile portable devices for example smartphone tablet notebook and a SOHO Ethernet switch with several ports to connect to wired devices for example Network Attached Storage PC STB notebook .

For example the HDD in the home Gateway currently has an ID number 256 GB of total storage of which 75 percent is available 50 percent of the storage has been reserved for content has been assigned tier 1 relative to a user device is one communication network hop from smart phone A is zero communication network hops from home Gateway A is currently connected to a home WiFi and a broadband xDSL connection. The HDD in the home Gateway is currently associated with device IDs over one or more communication networks. Many of these value parameters may change over time.

A content it is to be understood that a reference to content may represent a selectable element of a plurality of content includes any data a user may want to consume for example install or play a video game content watch a movie or video content view a photo content read a book content listen to a song content install or execute a software program app or update open a file content browse or read a web page content read an email content etc. or share with other users. Examples are movies sport events shows videos photos music music videos news web pages books audio books ring tones games software programs software updates apps etc. Available content is heterogeneous in many different parameters. In some embodiments it is visual for example photos audio for example music or visual and audio for example movies sporting event musical videos games . In some embodiments it is streamed during consumption for example live TV or it may need to be fully or partially preloaded prior to use for example games photos software . It may be short or long it may come in different formats for example an audio stream is compressed using an audio codec such as MP3 Vorbis or AAC or a video stream is compressed using a video codec such as H.264 or VP8 for different user devices for example HD TV vs. smartphone and or in different formats for the same device for example SD vs. HD . It may have very different sizes relative to the communication network bandwidth for example large medium or small . It may require different QoS parameters for a satisfied user QoE consumption. Relative to the content provider it may be free or have a per use licensing fee or a content group licensing fee or a per time period fee. Relative to the user it may be free free with sponsoring ads or have a per use fee or a per time period fee. is a table that shows some examples of tabulated content available at a content provider with some example content parameters listed.

Many of this large heterogeneous set of content elements or plurality of content available is preloaded onto the storage associated with a user device and consumed at a convenient time for the user at the appropriate user device.

In some embodiments storage elements associated with user devices is a precious resource just like bandwidth computing and battery power and may be managed to provide enhanced value to the user. The table in includes an example of storage elements and an example of parameters that may be helpful to a storage manager or a content manager etc. .

The storage manager may include several functionalities to help manage the storage resources for example storage elements associated with user devices from a user or a group of users.

The storage manager may reside at one or more locations. includes an example of a home network with storage manager and content manager functionality in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments the storage manager is included at the user device as a storage manager device in an embodiment a storage manager is included within a device agent and operable on a processor in a user device or resides at a centralized location associated with the user and manage several user devices such as a home gateway as a storage manager home or resides at the content provider as a storage manager server . Alternatively or in addition the storage manager server may also reside at a content broker that manages content of a plurality of content providers for a plurality of users. In some embodiments the storage manager resides at a content distribution server. The storage manager may have a master s lave server client centralized or distributed configurations to manage storage of the plurality of user devices.

In some embodiments the storage manager discovery function includes initializing a table such as . In some embodiments the storage manager discovery function includes one or more of searching for a list of storage elements assigning them a name or an ID fetching the storage location storage size storage type for example HDD Flash etc. storage access time storage available or free storage and how this storage is connected to a user device. A storage element may be located inside a user device for example through a communication network such as a data communication bus or may be connected through one or more modems over one or more communications network to other user devices. A storage element may require multiple communication network hops to be connected to a user device. Communication network connectivity parameters of interest to the storage manager between the one or more storage elements and the one or more user devices could include one or more of modem type for example WiFi Ethernet etc. statistical parameters of the connection for example max min typical bandwidth etc. QoS parameters other applications using the connection users sharing the connection reliability of the connection latency number of hops etc. For the example embodiment in the storage manager discovery function could identify a flash of Smartphone A has an ID of a total storage capacity of 32 of which 50 percent is currently available. The flash storage element is coupled to modems that enable connectivity to cellular and WiFi networks. In some embodiments at the time of discovery the flash storage element could communicate with storage elements for example the smartphone is connected to the PC through a fast and low cost USB port and for example connected to home gateway through the WiFi and for example connected to home gateway through the WiFi and the home gateway is connected to Network Attached Storage through Ethernet .

In some embodiments the storage manager discovery function determines that the user device Smartphone A is 0 communication hops away from the relatively small Flash in Smartphone A one communication hops from the larger storage in PC A and two communication link hops away the largest storage in Network Attached Storage. In some embodiments the smartphone A is connected to the Network Attached Storage over two sequential communication network hops. In some embodiments the communication network connectivity performance will be determined by the aggregate of these two sequential serial or cascaded links. In some embodiments with two sequential communication network hops the overall latency will be larger than or equal to the sum of each link latency and the overall bandwidth will be less than or equal to the lower bandwidth communication network link bandwidth and the QoS QoE will be limited by the worse of the two links.

In some embodiments there may be two or more communication networks or one or more communication networks with more than one path between a user device and a storage element. In some embodiments each of the communication paths is managed for example monitored logged etc. independently with associated parameters for each of the communication network paths. In some embodiments each of the communication network paths is used to transfer content more efficiently based on content parameters user parameters etc. and is used effectively as one or more of the communication paths becomes unreliable or is disconnected or disabled or powered down.

In some embodiments storage element parameters including connectivity parameters change over time. In some embodiments a user device may be carried outside the home WiFi coverage area for example carried to work or a storage element for example a the Network Attached Storage attached to a home gateway may be powered down or a mobile device for example a smartphone connected to a portable device for example a notebook through a personal area network PAN for example a USB cable for a big content transfer may be disconnected later. In some embodiments it is advantageous to update for example periodically or dynamically the storage manager status information. The storage manager update function is located at a subset of the user devices for example as a storage manager update function device or at a central location for a plurality of user devices associated with a user for example as a storage manager update function home or work or at the content provider for example distribution server or reservoir for example as a storage manager update function server . The storage manager information is distributed or centralized across one or more storage manager update function sites. The storage manager update functions could use keep alive signals to maintain storage manager status or polling signals or interrupt signals from devices or some other method. In some embodiments this information is used to maintain a current status of the storage network for embodiments a storage network includes a plurality of storage elements available to the user or a user device. In some embodiments this function monitors status changes in storage on off status connectivity on off list of active modems modem link performance connectivity bandwidth QoS QoE available storage available content location number of hops etc. In some embodiments this function determines if new storage is added to the network problems with the storage for example reliability corruption etc. . The storage manager update function could also delete storage elements from the storage network if necessary.

In some embodiments the storage manager update function monitors storage element parameters and compute statistics vs. time or vs. location or vs. user. In some embodiments the storage manager update function is useful for preloading content or providing content to the end user. In some embodiments if a storage element is usually powered down at night it may not be helpful for storing off peak broadband data downloaded at night. If a user device is carried to work during the day it is helpful to preload a coupled or attached storage element with content at night. If the user of a user device takes the user device to the park without cellular data coverage for lunch break to read financial news it may be helpful to preload relevant content during the morning over the users work communication network.

To enhance the storage manager operation it may be advantageous to provide it with storage parameter information relative to the user s . In some embodiments during enrollment the user may input a list of preferences for example partially and or updating over time . is a table that includes an example of a user input table in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments the user s may input for each storage element preferences related to the content type for example ranked or graded scaled could include blocked content parental control content format how much storage to reserve for content if the storage element is used by a single or a list or a group of users. In some embodiments the user may specify preferred locations where the storage element will be used and preferred communication network for example is ranked list could have a exclusive list preferred list blocked list etc. . The user may input information related to the various communication network data plans available. The user s may update the information over time.

In some embodiments a user entity may be a user device storage element etc. In addition to the direct input from the user the user entity may collect user and or user device and or storage history instead of user input or in addition to user input to further assist the storage manager. This information could include user utilization of user entities for example times or locations content type format etc. vs. time location consumed at the user devices content type format etc. purchased vs. time location at the user devices. This information could further include updated usage or predicted usage of communication network data plans relative to cost limits etc. This information could further include responses from the user to storage manager notifications. In some embodiments the storage manager may notice that a specific storage element has not been used for an amount of time larger than a threshold and notify the user and request a yes no answer to whether this storage element is no longer available for example damaged or deleted from home network .

In some embodiments the storage manager includes a storage manager allocation function that provides storage for an improved user s content value. The storage manager can run its own allocation function based on several attributes including content size user s preferences user s historical content consumption for example type quality user s need of content based on its location the likelihood of the content being consumed by the user the content life expectancy for example amount of days hours it will be stored etc.

In some embodiments storage elements inform the one or more storage managers of storage availability while being cognizant of storage needs of the application that are in place in the user device. In some embodiments storage resources are managed across a communication network over various user entities in order to provide a better user experience as far as content consumption storage consumers . This means that by aggregating all the available storage elements in a common pool the storage manager is able to provide a larger and more valuable storage per user for immediate and or near to immediate consuming.

In some embodiments based on a storage request from a content distribution server for example a content manager operable on the content distribution server a storage manager allocates a fixed storage size to a given user not necessary cognizant to content itself or variable size storage. The storage can be based on min and peak value as identified to the content manager.

Some embodiments can also strive to provide content that is closer to the user device if not necessarily on the device. In this manner the user can then download the content faster and will more likely download content than if had to go through a congested or expensive communication network from a content source.

Some embodiments include preloading content to at least one of a plurality of storage elements wherein the plurality of storage elements includes the storage element. In some embodiments preloading includes classifying each of the plurality of storage elements based on a plurality of content parameters and preloading based on the classifications. In some embodiments the multiple storage elements are associated with a single user device. In some embodiments the multiple storage elements are associated with more than a single user device.

In some embodiments classifying each of the plurality of storage elements influences the value metric wherein the value metric influences which of the plurality of content is selected. In some embodiments the classifying of each of the plurality of storage elements includes evaluating a communication network between at least one associated user device and one or more of the plurality of storage elements.

In some embodiments given the plurality of storage elements with differences in storage size connectivity mobility etc. associated with a plurality of user devices located at physical time connectivity etc. locations relative to the user it may be advantageous to classify the storage elements to help simplify the storage management and content management. In some embodiments classifying comprises one or more of organizing sorting ranking classifying into tiers. In some embodiments the classifying is based on one or more of the following storage element or communication network parameters access time latency access bandwidth QoS QoE storage available size number of communication hops to the user device or consuming user. In some embodiments the classifying is based on the storage locations for example home storage work storage POI storage cloud storage content provider storage or content broker storage network. In some embodiments the classifying is based on location connectivity or speed relative to a particular user device or a particular user. The classification is static quasi static or dynamic. An example of static storage classification is a fully wired network that does not add or delete any elements. A quasi static storage classification is a fully wired network that does allow to adding or deleting elements or power up down some elements for example to save power dynamically when less storage is necessary . An example of dynamic storage classification is a mix of wired and wireless user devices where a subset of user devices enter and exit a WLAN coverage area.

Tier zero storage element Storage within the communication bus of the user device. This is the most valuable storage element for this user device but may not have sufficient available allocated or free capacity for additional content storage.

Tier one storage element Storage element within a local network faster access time such as home gateway server. The content resides in a short and fast communication network distance away from the user device.

Tier two storage element Storage element not attached directly to the local network but it is in close proximity for example two communication network hops away from the device. For example a Network Attached Storage connected by Ethernet to a Home Gateway with WLAN capability communicating to mobile portable user devices.

Tier three storage element Storage having a limited access time scattered within network for example auxiliary PCs disconnected auxiliary backup HDD .

In some embodiments preloading a content comprises pushing the content from a content source network entity content distribution server cloud service provider content provider content broker etc. to a content destination user entity storage element user device with storage etc. . In some embodiments the content source typically selects the content and the target storage element and initiates the preloading.

In some embodiments preloading a content comprises pushing the content from a source network entity cloud service provider content provider content broker etc. to a plurality of destinations user entity storage element user device with storage etc. through multicasting. In some embodiments the source element typically selects the content and the plurality of target storage element and initiates the preloading.

In some embodiments preloading a content comprises pulling the content from a content source network entity cloud service provider content provider content broker etc. to a content destination user entity storage element user device with storage etc. . In some embodiments the content destination element typically selects the content and the target storage element and initiates the request for preloading.

In some embodiments the source may be a user entity for example user generated content located at a user device storage element etc. and the destination may be a network entity service provider storage provider content broker content provider cloud etc. . In some embodiments the source may be a first user entity user device storage element etc. and the destination may be a second entity user device storage element etc. . In some embodiments the destination storage entity of a first preload for example POI storage may be a source for a second preload to a second destination storage element. In some embodiments preloading a content may comprise an intermediate storage element. For example a content targeted to a mobile user device may be preloaded to the user s home set top box or gateway over a wide area broadband communication network and subsequently preloaded from the set top box to the mobile user device local storage over a home WiFi network.

In some embodiments the preloaded content destination may be a storage element of a first user device and a user may select the content to be presented at a second user device. In some embodiments the first user device may not have the appropriate presentation hardware for example display resolution for the preloaded content or may not have the appropriate software for example an image decoder for the preloaded content. In some embodiments the preloaded content may not be preloaded onto storage element of the second user device. In some embodiments a video or movie may be preloaded onto a smart phone flash storage and presented or displayed on a TV over WiFi. The choice between presenting the content from the first user device included storage element over a communication network to a second user device UI or preloading onto the second user device storage prior to presentation may be based on a value metric. The value metric may be a function of one or more of communication network parameters performance cost etc. storage element parameters performance availability cost etc. etc.

In some embodiments a content preloading may be initiated based on a value metric but may be paused interrupted stopped etc. based on changes in value parameters over time. For example a movie content may initiate preloading when a mobile user device is in the home WiFi network but pause as the mobile user device is no longer in the coverage area of the home WiFi in switching to a 3G data network. In some embodiments a content preloading may be restarted based on changes in value metric parameters over time.

In some embodiments a preloaded content may comprise preloaded business rules content rules policies etc. collectively denoted business rules associated with the preloaded content. These business rules may include information associated with the consumption of the content.

In some embodiments several storage elements share a communication network. In some embodiments list of content for preloading associated to each storage element for example several users sharing a DOCSIS channel or a satellite channel are aggregated and content that is targeted to more than one storage element is multicast or broadcast over the communication network. This embodiment has the benefit of sharing communication network cost over more than one storage element. This may improve a value metric resulting in greater preloads or more profit. This embodiment is especially valuable for lossless communication networks. If the communication network is lossy one or more storage elements preloading the multicast or broadcast content may be missing some of the information necessary for presenting the content. For the majority of communication networks the packet error rate loss is typically a small percentage of the packets transmitted the largest values are typically for NLOS wireless where targets are typically 1 percent . The packet error rate is reduced by a second multicast or broadcast of the content. In some embodiments a content is multicast a second time based on a packet error rate of the communication network. If the first and second transmissions are independent the aggregate packet error rate after two multicasts would reduce the packet error rate by the second power of the packet error rate for example 1 percent would become 0.01 percent . In some embodiments if the packet error rate is low the erroneous packets are downloaded during content consumption. In some embodiments one of more a storage element could pull or request the missing or erroneous packets. For example if a content is preloaded by multicast onto 10 storage elements with a packet error rate of 1 percent typically a second multicast would double the communication network resources and result in a packet error rate of 0.01 percent. If each of the storage elements requests the missing or erroneous 1 percent of packets this would add 10 percent of packets being retransmitted plus some overhead . If the probability of consumption is 20 percent on the average only 2 percent of the packets would be retransmitted downloaded plus overhead . The relative benefits of each embodiment depend on one or more of the packet error rate the number of storage elements being multicast the packet error rate likelihood of consumption etc.

In some embodiments the user may choose to disable content preload if the battery power is below a threshold or not connected to an AC charging source or when the user is streaming movies. The user s may update the information over time.

In some embodiments a content manager collects user content consumption history user parameters for example vs. time location device Communication Network etc. in exchange of user input or in addition to user input to further assist the content manager. If there is more than one user the content manager may collect consumption history separately for each user or classify the one or more users into groups for consumption history input collection. This may be more valuable at a POI access network for example coffee shop grocery etc. where the target content consumer population is usually larger. In some embodiments this information includes user content consumption purchase vs. type format etc. vs. time location consumed at the user devices. In some embodiments this information includes updated usage or predicted usage of communication network data plans relative to cost limits etc. In some embodiments this information includes responses from the user to content manager notifications. In some embodiments the content manager may notice that a specific content has not been used for an amount of time larger than a threshold and notify the user and request a yes no answer to whether this content may be deleted.

In some embodiments the content manager obtains user current location user parameter or collect estimate predict future location for example work home business travel airport coffee shop to determine what content to preload on the storage elements available to the user currently or in the future. The user may consume or purchase different content at different locations. In some embodiments the content is preloaded on storage associated with the user device for example at the POI storage associated with the location. If storage is limited at a user device internal storage the storage and content managers may require to swap the content available as the user changes location.

In some embodiments the user parameters include information about the past for example user content consumption history or location history trace or information about the present for example a user current location a current list of preloaded content a current list of storage elements available to a user device etc. or information about the future for example predicting future location based on location trace or location history for example predicting future location based on a calendar s chedule etc. .

In addition to increasing value of content to the content distribution system the content manager may preload content a user may require at the location for example pre stored maps traffic profiles or directions from the airport POI information for example hotels restaurants taxis in case there is no access network available. In addition preloaded rich targeted advertisements is preloaded.

In some embodiments the content manager collects user parameters such as current or collect estimate predict future leisure mode for example working walking eating business or pleasure traveling business meeting etc. to determine what content to preload on the storage elements available to the user.

In some embodiments a user s parameters are collected without or independently of any user input or preferences. In some embodiments a content manager preloads the content without any user individual selection of the content elements.

In some embodiments the content manager collects user parameters such as content consumption or purchase behavior vs. time of day day of week for example is coupled with location or leisure mode . A user may prefer to install software weekdays during the morning or watch movies at night or install apps on Sundays.

Examples of user device parameters relevant to the content manager are device type for example mobile portable fixed device usage location for example work home POI etc. shared or single user.

In some embodiments the user device state is used as a user device parameter. Examples of device state include current user s or future predicted user s associated with the device device powered up state device connected to AC or battery powered remaining battery power current and predicted communication networks congestion of the available networks distributed storage status for example tiered storage currently associated with the user device location of the device etc. In some embodiments the user device parameters are updated over time wherein parameters is updated periodically or based on interrupts or based on event etc.

These include WLAN access points gateways reservoirs etc. that could preload or download selected valuable content to be preloaded or downloaded to intended storage associated to user devices or directly to user devices. Example of POI are coffee shops restaurants airports grocery stores department stores libraries public buildings parks sporting venues etc. where a plurality of users could congregate or associate with. POI devices typically serve multiple users or multiple user devices. In some embodiments users have a group parameter or characteristic that helps predict what content to preload at the POI reservoir to avoid straining the shared access network connection from the POI devices to the content providers. In some embodiments if an access point of a coffee shop has a single T1 backhaul 1.5 Mbps it may not be able to support more than a couple of users streaming mobile device for example smartphone or tablet quality video. The streaming content may be frequently stalling and buffering for all if more users join the POI access network. To help a POI content manager relevant information could include POI access network parameters to user devices for example WiFi modem air interface supported 11a b g n ac coverage area statistics of data rates with user devices current user parameters in coverage area historical users parameters for example profile history in coverage area vs. time of day for example a coffee shop may have more business customers during the day but more students at night historical content consumed and purchased from the POI reservoir. Moreover communication network parameters from the POI device to the content provider could also be relevant for example bandwidth cost structure QoS QoE wired vs. wireless vs. mesh backhaul etc. . In some embodiments the POI device parameters are updated over time wherein parameters is updated periodically or based on interrupts or based on event etc.

Based on POI parameters above a POI content manager at a POI device maybe vs time can preload targeted selected valuable content as the plurality of users changes at the POI coverage area. In some embodiments a POI content manager jointly controls several POI devices and select content accordingly as users may consume and purchase different content when at different POI device.

A user device or storage element could have access to many types of communication networks home networks access networks broadband networks cellular networks POI networks device bus etc. and each may include a number of communication network parameters or other information for example weights functions models relationship between one of the previously described parameters etc. that could help increase the value of the content preloaded onto the storage elements. Communication network parameters could include customer satisfaction or QoE value metric information could include content consumed or purchased relative to content cost or any content sponsoring ads revenue and or relative to connectivity or storage cost. The plurality of communication networks could have significantly different performance for example bandwidth latency jitter and significantly different cost structure. Therefore knowledge of communication network parameters is a key element of a content or storage manager s content preloading algorithm s. lists some example communication connectivity network parameters a user device or storage may have access to. Parameters may include speed or bandwidth or latency or jitter statistics for example typical max min histograms cumulative distribution functions CDFs . Communication network parameters may include cost structure. Cost structure could include set up costs cost per time period unlimited usage or max usage or cap per time period cost of usage above a threshold or cap. Cost structure could include whom pays for the usage a user s a user device one or more content providers one or more sponsor one or more ad provider a content broker ad broker etc. A cost structure could include a storage manager from a content or ad provider sponsoring the communication network cost in exchange for storage allocation of content or ads. The user may pay for usage not related to content preloading or the content provider or content broker may pay for communication network usage related to the content preloaded. In some embodiments the communication network information is updated over time wherein parameters is updated periodically or based on interrupts or based on event etc.

In some embodiments the content manager notifies the user device if the desired content could not be delivered with adequate QoE given the communication network parameters or notifies about related preloaded content available or other content that is delivered with adequate QoE over the network. In some embodiments the content manager notifies the user device if the desired content is not allowed by the communication network or if the user preferences indicate that the user has selected not to allowed the target communication network for example the user may be invited to overwrite the profile or make an exception . The content manager may also monitor the communication network data plan usage and alert of usage overruns or predicted overruns.

In some embodiments from a population of 10 000 coffee shops in a system the POI of the reservoir of 100 or one percent of these is preloaded with a specific content at a specific price. Based on the user consumption or purchase a decision to preload to the remaining 99 percent coffee shops is determined. In some embodiments price elasticity is determined. In some embodiments three percent of the POI reservoirs is preloaded with a specific content with each of three subgroups of one percent priced at low medium high levels. The statistical value metric of these three subgroups for example uptake times price cost is used to price the remaining 97 percent of the POI. In a different embodiment user devices are classified by type for example smartphone table notebook and a target content is preloaded onto 100 instances of each type. Consumption or purchase statistics or other value metric information are collected per group and used by the content manager for future content preloading. In a different embodiment users are classified by income for example 30K and a target content is preloaded onto 100 users of each type. Consumption or purchase statistics are collected per group and used by the content manager for future content preloading. Test market group value metric information is further collected per user demographics for example age group sex occupation leisure status per time of day per day of week per communication network per POI per content provider per content type per content format or any other parameter of the user user device storage element location time content communication network etc. and folded back into content manager value metric or profitability analysis for future content preloading.

In some embodiments the statistical information is managed by a content broker. In some embodiments the statistical information from the test market is shared with the content providers. In some embodiments the statistical demographic price elasticity etc. data is used by the content provider for improved pricing or improved uptake or improved targeted content or targeted ads to the appropriate demographics etc.

At a given location and time the user device could have one or more associated storage elements. In some embodiments the storage manager discovers and or updates the available associated storage automatically or with help from the user device or user etc. The storage elements available to the user device could include local storage on the user device or storage that is accessed over communication networks such as home gateways POI reservoirs etc. In some embodiments these storage elements are classified into tiers based on the communication distance for example latency bandwidth and storage parameters for example size available space access type HDD SSD flash to the user device. In some embodiments the content manager assigns different content amounts or types or sizes into different tiers automatically. The user may have a better content QoE by streaming from a POI reservoir from a nearby gateway with preloaded content over a faster local communication network without having to access a slower and more costly cellular mobile access network. The user may not need to pre select content and could have instant availability without any planning needed. Content can be sent directly to each tier.

In some embodiments content for a gateway is chosen based on multiple user devices that may be near gateway. Stored content at the tier that is easiest for the user to get to for example based on location time user device consumption can be designated as nearest to the gateway. Typically lower storage tiers have more storage capacity and are less portable than mobile devices.

In some embodiments notifications are presented to the user at a user device interface by one or more storage managers or content managers or device software or device agents or device applications at the user device or at storage element or home network device or POI device or content provider server or content broker server etc. In some embodiments notification includes content information for example content lists types format price availability rules etc. updated content information new content stale content specials communication network status communication network updates associated storage tier storage etc. Notification can be presented based on when content file has been stored. A notification can also be presented based on location or time of day when a particular content has been preloaded. In some embodiments a notification is I noticed you are at the airport here is some content that is available at your device. Notification messages may be informative for example a list of content and price or may require user responses or actions for example content A has not been consumed in 7 days do you want to delete . Notifications may include new preloading services or features upgrades in service status of service plan etc. Notifications may include information to improve the preloading service for example update preferences permission to share parameters associated with the user survey responses etc. .

In some embodiments at least a portion of a second content available on the storage element is moved to a second storage element associated with a user or user device.

Value metric information for example parameters weights etc. may be obtained from virtual or real world sources. In some embodiments value metric information is obtained from a user s user device activity for browsing history content interaction history etc. or information of the user available on the internet public or private sources etc. or information of the virtual or real world social networks associated with a user for example value metric information of siblings value metrics of coworkers classmates or value metric information of virtual friends etc. 

In some embodiments value metric information is gathered locally at a user device or remotely at a POI device or network entity server etc. The value metric information may be gathered at a single location or gathered at multiple locations. Value metrics may be obtained at a single location or obtained at multiple locations. Multiple value metrics may be combined at a single location. A content selection for preloading may involve computing more than one value metric by one or more entities. In some embodiments a network element for example a content broker server may compute a value metric based on value metric information from a user device and a content provider for selecting a content to be preloaded to the user device. The user device may compute a second value metric based on a user parameter. The joint or combined value metric may be utilized for a decision to preload or not a content. The first value metric may be used to preload the content and the second value metric may be used to make decisions to delete or move the content from the user device etc.

It may be beneficial to select content to preload based on value metrics. Value metrics may be obtained from a value metric function or model and may include one or more value metric parameters one or more weights or one or more relationships between the value metric parameters resulting in different interpretation goals priorities etc. of the value metric. Value metric is in one or more units of user time user satisfaction GB POI number of users Threshold Communication Network etc. where is any currency or monetary or financial unit.

In some embodiments a value metric is a single value or a vector multiple values . In some embodiments a value metric is associated to a single content or a group plurality of content.

In a content distribution system that includes one or more of users user devices storage elements communication networks content content providers content brokers the user devices the storage elements the content or the communication networks may be valuable resources that the users content brokers and content providers may like to exploit by preloading appropriate content on appropriate storage elements over appropriate communication networks. To improve the value of the content distribution system one or more parties may assign value to the elements of the content distribution system with value metrics. In some embodiments a value metric is based on a single parameter or is derived as a combination of parameters.

A content manager may include improving the value metric of the content that is preloaded onto one or more storage elements associated to one or more user devices that one or more users may consume or purchase or selection of content based on value metric. The content manager may use one or more parameters associated with a user a user devices a storage a communication network a content providers a content brokers etc. as described above. In some embodiments a value metric is one or more of the current value future value expected value minimum value maximum value threshold value percentile value etc. In some embodiments the value metric comprises one or more of increasing improving enhancing user satisfaction user QoE user experience user mobility user attach rate user feedback user purchase rate user uptake user loyalty number of users user growth user referrals etc. The value metric could comprise one or more of reduce cost reduce user device cost reduce communication network cost reduce content cost reducing storage usage etc. The value metric could comprise increase revenue increase content revenue increase user revenue increase profit increase profit margin increase revenue growth increase battery life increase number of patrons into a POI establishment increase number of ads consumed increase number of ads clicked etc. The value metric may apply to one or more users one or more user devices one or more communication network providers one or more POI one or more content providers one or more ad content providers one or more content brokers etc. The value metric may apply to one or more elements of an entity or one or more elements of multiple entities simultaneously. The value metric target is different for each entity or element of an entity for example the value metric is user satisfaction for user A cost month for user B number of patrons for POI A number of users for content provider A total revenue for content provider B and profit user for content broker A etc. .

In some embodiments the value metric comprises a computation based on a single content or a group of content or on all the content on one or more storage elements associated to the user device. A group of content is a several content of a given type for example movies or games standard definition SD or HD etc. or several content of a given price or several content on the same storage element etc. The value metric of a group could change over time or over location. In some embodiments the value metric of a group is HD movies on home reservoir when user device is within coverage area of home network but is HD movies in POI reservoir when user device is within coverage area of a coffee shop with POI access network . Similarly all the content associated to the user device could change over time and location.

In some embodiments the value metric of a group of content through N is represented as VM for Content  N VM Content  . . . Content N UP UDP SEP CNP . . . where UP UDP SEP CNP represent user parameters user device parameters storage parameters communication network parameters. In this notation the value metric of a single content N 1 would be VM for Content N 1 VM Content N 1 UP UDP SEP CNP . . . .

The effects of adding the content N 1 to an existing storage element with content to N would be represented as Incremental VM for adding Content N 1 VM for Content  N 1 VM for Content  N.

The effects of deleting the content N to an existing storage element with content to N would be represented as Incremental VM for deleting Content N VM for Content  N 1 VM for Content  N.

In some embodiments these incremental value metrics for adding or deleting content are used to increase the value of preloaded content when storage space is available or for deleting preloaded content when storage space is low or for swapping low value content for new content that may be more valuable. In some embodiments the expressions for adding and deleting are used simultaneously for swapping content. In some embodiments these expressions are extended for adding or deleting or swapping groups of content. In some embodiments these expressions are used for sorting content to be preloaded or deleted or swapped .

In some embodiments the value metric for additional content considered for preload is computed relative to one or more content previously preloaded on the storage associated to the user device. An associated storage element may be full in which case deleting moving swapping of previously preloaded content may be required to preload new content or may have available storage. In both cases the new content may affect the value metrics parameters for example likelihood to consume of previously preloaded content. The previously preloaded content may be moved to a different storage element associated to the user device. In some embodiments user device may be at within home network and about to leave to go to work network if a content resulting in higher valuable metric is identified to be preloaded onto the local storage for user device over home network a content with lower valuable metric may be moved to home reservoir over home network for a later consumption. This may save communication network cost.

In some embodiments the value metric for a additional group of content may be considered for preload and is computed relative jointly to one or more content previously preloaded on the storage associated to the user device. An associated storage element may be full in which case deleting moving swapping of previously preloaded content may be required to preload new group of content or may have available storage. In both cases the new group of content may affect the value metrics parameters for example likelihood to consume of previously preloaded content. A subset of the previously preloaded content may be moved to a different storage element associated to the user device. In some embodiments user device may be at within home network and about to leave to go to work network if a group of content resulting in higher valuable metric is identified to be preloaded onto the local storage for user device over home network a content with lower valuable metric may be moved to home reservoir over home network for a later consumption. This may save communication network cost.

Previously preloaded content may be re distributed over storage elements associated with user device to improve value metrics. In some embodiments content in the local storage of user device is moved to home reservoir or content on home reservoir is moved to the local storage of user device when user device is within the coverage area of home network . In some embodiments content that may be more valuable at work may be moved to the home gateway when user device gets home in the evening in exchange for content that may be more valuable when the user device is at home. The reverse operation is performed the following morning prior to user device going to work.

In some embodiments previously preloaded content is deleted to improve value metrics associated to the remaining previously preloaded content. In some embodiments low value metric content may be deleted from user device to increase the likelihood of consuming more rewarding higher value metric content.

The value metric function used to compute value metrics may change over time or location or communication network etc. In some embodiments the value metric function that assigns more weight to likelihood of consumption of a user associated to user device prior to a long flight will encourage preloading content with higher likelihood of consumption so that the user is not disappointed without any entertainment when out of communication network connection. In some embodiments the value metric function assigns more weight to cost reduction when the user associated to user device is at home during the weekend when other entertainment choices may be available.

The value metric function may be different for each user or each user device or each storage element associated to each user device. In some embodiments a user associated with user device with an unlimited content flat fee monthly plan may prefer a value metric function that assigns more weight to hours of content consumption per month. In some embodiments a storage element associated with a user device with very large available storage may have a very small weight for storage cost value metric parameter but the local storage in user device may be limited and require a large weight to storage usage in the value metric function.

Improving a value metric could include one or more of optimization maximization minimization maxmin maximizing the minimum value minmax minimizing the maximum value maximizing a percentile maximizing or optimizing an expected value etc.

A value metric may apply to one or more of a user a plurality of users a content provider an ad provider an ad service provider ad broker a content broker an communication network provider etc.

The value metric is associated with storage elements content elements user devices POI storage elements etc.

Value metrics associated to a user device are those that include one or more of value metric parameters value metric parameter relationships value metric parameter weights value metric functions of models that are intended to benefit a user device or from the point of view or perspective of a user device etc.

Value metric parameters may change as the user device changes location or over time etc. In some embodiments the communication network cost of Movie A in is 0 when the user device is in the coverage area of its home network but is really costly when the communication network is a roaming network. In some embodiments the user likelihood of watching a movie during business hours is low but could increase during lunch hour or on the way home on public transportation. Alternatively price to user specials promotions sponsored services could vary over time as the content providers or content brokers changed the business rules of the content.

In some embodiments the value metric is associated with the cost of the content consumption per unit of time. This value metric is obtained by adding the cost columns for example etc. and subtracting the subsidies for example and normalizing by the amount of time the user could enjoy the content for example . In some embodiments the user is only responsible for paying the price to use if the content consumption is initiated or completed but typically the communication network cost may be incurred if the content is preloaded whether the content is consumed or not. In this case it may be advantageous to penalize the communication network cost accordingly. In some embodiments the communication network cost may be normalized for example divided by by the likelihood that the user will consume the content. In some embodiments if a content has a 20 percent chance of being consumed the communication network cost is multiplied by 5 1 20 percent since on the average a content with these parameters would require 5 preloads before being consumed. The user likelihood to consume parameter is a function of how long of a time window is computed over. For this case it may be advantageous to consider the time interval before the content will be deleted or swapped for a different content. In many instances normalizing the communication network cost by the user likelihood to consume will penalize preloading large content over expensive networks which is not economically advantageous to the user. In some embodiments the user of the user device prepays for the storage associated to the user device as a one time cost item and does not incur any costs per gigabyte per day. But if the user device preloads a large single item that fills up the storage the value of this content to the user may be low for example a single 16 GB game may fill up the flash of a tablet . Therefore methods to assign a cost to storage used by content may be advantageous. In some embodiments the storage required by the content is normalized for example divided by the available storage. In some embodiments the storage required is normalized for example divided by the likelihood to consume. In some embodiments the storage required by the content is normalized by both the available storage and the likelihood to consume the content. For example if a user device has 10 GB of available storage a 1 GB movie preloaded into this device will occupy 10 percent of the available storage. If this 1 GB movie has a 5 percent chance of being consumed on the average it will take approximately 20 content items with this profile for the user to consume one of them. The available storage will not support 20 content items with this profile therefore this is may not be a valuable content. Therefore normalizing the storage required for a content by the available storage and the likelihood to consume is a valuable metric to select content to be preloaded. This value metric quantifies the effective footprint of this content relative to the available storage. Therefore content with a lower value would be preferred and typically a value significantly lower than 1 would be advantageous. This value metric is compared to a threshold prior to preloading or may be used to rank a plurality of content prior to preloading or may be used as an opportunity cost relative to the previously preloaded content currently available at the storage element before making a decision to swap content for example if the storage is full.

In some embodiments a content provider or a content broker or some other entity is willing to pay for access to the available storage at the user device. In some embodiments this entity may be willing to pay in units of dollar per gigabyte per day utilized or a flat fee for a predetermined number of gigabytes per month. This amount is used as a reference or an opportunity cost when making decisions to preload alternative content.

In some embodiments user device may be a tablet with WiFi and cellular capability located within the coverage of both home network and access network . Therefore the user device could access to the content listed in for home reservoir or the content listed in for content provider reservoir or . In some embodiments the user of user device may have selected the profile in indicating preference for movies and games in HD 720p format in home WiFi network for communication network.

In some embodiments a user device value metric for a content under consideration is if type and format included in user preferences if comm network active price min For this example if the content type does not match or the communication network is not active the value of the if statement is zero otherwise it is one.

After taking into account the user preferences and the content available at the reservoirs of and the user device for example a tablet is currently connected to the three content items listed in Movie A Game A Game C currently have value metric greater than zero. In this example a lower value metric would be advantageous to a user of the user device since the price per hour of content consumption is something the user will typical want to minimize as long as the content is enjoyable . For this example the relatively large and most expensive item provides the better value. If the value metric included a restriction or a cost penalty on the available storage size on the table the value metric could have resulted in a different value. In some embodiments if the table only had 8 GB of available space only the Movie A would have a value metric greater than zero for this the storage element.

In some embodiments value metrics associated to a content provider include one or more of value metric parameters value metric parameter relationships value metric parameter weights value metric functions of models that are intended to benefit a content provider or from the point of view or perspective of a content provider etc.

In some embodiments a content provider has a content provider reservoir for example . The content provider may have access or permission to preload content onto storage elements associated to user devices associated to a user multiple users groups of users for example POI devices or any other devices. In some embodiments the content provider assists in preloading selected content from the content provider reservoir over a selected communication network on to selected storage elements associated to the selected user devices targeting the selected users based on value metrics associated to a content provider.

Example parameters associated with the content elements that may be useful to compute value metrics associated to a content provider are listed in . For example a name and ID number a type a format a size a duration a licensing cost a list price or any other parameters. The parameter type may be used to classify the content and to match a user or group of users or user device profile preferences or profile history. The parameter format may be used to match the content to a device capable of presenting it for example processor power display resolution etc. . The size parameter may be used to compare relative to the available space at the target storage element or the cost of the storage or as an opportunity cost relative to other content or to rank content etc. The duration parameter may be used to estimate the time a user may spend consuming the content or to normalize relative to the size to compare versus streaming etc. The licensing cost is the cost the content provider may need to pay the author of the content after it is consumed by a user. The list price parameter may be the price a user may pay for consuming it. In some embodiments in addition to parameters associated to the content the content provider may require additional parameters associated with the user the user device the user device associated storage the communication network or any other parameters. is a table that includes examples of additional parameters that may be used to enhance value metric analysis from a content provider perspective or point of view for selecting content to preload for a user with user device A in accordance with some embodiments. The additional parameters include ad revenue that an ad provider may be willing to pay the content provider when an ad is viewed in connection with the target content and communication network cost that the content provider may be willing to subsidize or sponsor for preloading the content a user storage cost the content provider may be willing to pay the user for preloading content onto the users storage the user likelihood to consume the content etc. For example the user storage cost is in units of GB day. In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume the content is normalized to a time period for example user likelihood to consume over 1 day . In some embodiments one or more of the parameter values is different for a user or group of users. In some embodiments a user or group of users or user devices or storage elements may get a discount from the list price. In some embodiments a user or group of users may have declined inclusion of ads for a premium service. In some embodiments the likelihood of consumption is refined for specific target users or user devices or storage elements etc. In some embodiments the communication network cost or user storage cost may vary between users. In some embodiments the ad revenue for ad may vary between users especially if the ads are targeted to a user.

In some embodiments one or more of the parameters listed in are used to compute a value metric prior to preloading onto a target storage element associated to a user device associated to a user . In some embodiments content that is compatible with the user device is considered for preloading. In some embodiments content type or format that matches user profile is considered for preloading. In some embodiments the list price and the licensing cost are used to select preloaded content. The difference between list price and licensing cost is the profit to the content provider. The previous embodiment does not take into account the likelihood a user will consume this content. In some embodiments the difference between list price and licensing cost are further weighted for example multiplied by by the likelihood the user will consume it over a time interval. In some embodiments the list price minus the licensing cost jointly multiplied by the likelihood of user consumption over a period of time is a metric of the estimated profit for this user over this period of time. In some embodiments an ad provider pays the content provider when the user consumes the content and the associated ads. This ad revenue is added to the value metric. This ad revenue may be weighted by the user likelihood to consume the content associated to the ad. In some embodiments the content provider is responsible for paying sponsoring or subsidizing etc. the communication network cost associated with the content preload onto the storage element. In some embodiments the content provider is responsible for paying sponsoring or subsidizing etc. the communication network cost associated with the content transfer from the storage element to the user device. In either of the latter two cases it may be advantageous to subtract a communication network cost in the value metric. Likely the communication network cost will be incurred regardless of the content consumption and may be weighted by their user likelihood to consume the content. In some embodiments in the value metric is based on the following function if correct type if correct format list price licensing cost ad revenue user likelihood to consume storage cost communication network cost .

In this example content ID and content ID do not meet the value metric type and format and the corresponding value is assigned not valid not applicable not available or 0 etc. Content ID has a positive value metric of 0.25 and content ID has a negative value metric of 1.28. The main reason for a negative value metric for content ID is that the user likelihood to consume is rather low and the content size is rather large and the storage cost and communication network cost is included as a content provider preloading cost regardless if the content is consumed or not since it s not weighted by the user likelihood to consume . Based on content ID may be preloaded onto user device A for example a tablet but contentID may not be preloaded onto user device A.

In some embodiments the value metric of a content includes a divide by a time to consume the content. In some embodiments the value metrics in column of is further normalized by the duration column to obtain a value in units of expected profit per time period.

In some embodiments value metrics are evaluated to make decisions regarding deleting content. is a table that includes an example of an update to at a later time where content ID and are currently preloaded onto user device A in accordance with some embodiments. In this example at a later time content ID likelihood to be consumed has dropped from 25 percent to 3 percent and content ID likelihood to be consumed has dropped from 15 percent to 10 percent. The communication cost is not applicable because the content is already preloaded. If the value metric for deletion is based on if correct type if correct format list price licensing cost ad revenue user likelihood to consume storage cost . Based on this value metric content ID currently has a negative value metric since the expected benefits no longer offset the storage cost based on the reduced likelihood of consumption. Content ID has a positive value metric but may still be considered for deleting in exchange for new content if the value metric of the new content is more valuable.

In some embodiments value metrics are evaluated to make decisions regarding moving content. Moving content may incur and additional communication network cost or may change the user storage cost or user likelihood to consume. is a table that includes an example of an update to where the content currently preloaded onto user device B is considered for moving to a second storage element in accordance with some embodiments. In this example content ID likelihood to be consumed is estimated to drop from 25 percent to 15 percent after moving and content ID likelihood to be consumed has not changed. In this example the additional communication cost is set to zero because the content will be moved over a free home WiFi. If the value metric for deletion in is based on if correct type if correct format list price licensing cost ad revenue second user likelihood to consume secondstorage cost moving cost . Based on this value metric content ID value metric has dropped because the lower cost of storage does not offset the reduced likelihood or consumption. Content ID value metric has improved because of reduced storage cost while user likelihood of consumption has remained the same. Based on these value metrics content ID may remain at the current storage location and content ID may be moved to the second storage element for best value.

In some embodiments value metrics for moving are evaluated for a user perspective or a user device perspective or a storage element perspective or a content broker perspective or a service provider perspective etc.

In some embodiments a user likelihood to consume a content parameter is further based on one or more content currently preloaded at storage elements associated with the user device.

In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume a content parameter is based on one or more content previously consumed by the user.

In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume a specific content parameter is based on a particular time interval. In some embodiments the time interval is an hour 24 hours 7 days etc. One or more likelihoods for a given content is evaluated simultaneously when selecting content to preload remove swap etc. Managing content based on shorter time intervals likelihoods may increase the value metrics but may also result in more content swapping which may increase communication network costs or reduced battery life for portable or mobile devices. In some embodiments list price minus licensing costs weighted by user likelihood to or consume over a period of time is an indication of expected profit over a period of time for that user or user device. In some embodiments the ad revenue may be added or the communication network costs may be subtracted.

In some embodiments the value metric is normalized or scaled by the duration of the content consumption. In some embodiments all other parameters being comparable a 0.50 profit for a 5 min video may be more desirable than a 3 profit for a 2 hour movie or a 5 profit for a game that a user may play for 20 hours.

In some embodiments the value metric is normalized by the content size. This may be used in addition to storage cost which is proportional to content size or alternatively to storage costs. In some embodiments all other parameters being comparable a 1 GB game may be preferred over a 10 GB game. In some embodiments the content size normalization is relative to the available storage size. In some embodiments the value metric difference between a 10 GB game in a 1 GB is more significant for a device with 16 GB of free storage than a device with 512 GB of free storage.

In some embodiments the content provider or content broker pays a storage owner manager for access to a subset partition of storage available to a user. In this case it may be advantageous to compare the value metric relative to the storage cost prior to preloading moving deleting. This is especially the case if the content provider is paying per storage utilized. This may not be the case if this content provider has paid for a fixed amount of storage that is currently idling.

In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume one or more content is updated based on user history. The history is based on prior sequences of content consumptions. In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume a content is based on other users history for example test groups described earlier . In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume a content is updated based on the other content preloaded on the device for example in some cases a first content may increase the likelihood a second content may be consumed in other cases a first content may decrease the likelihood a second content may be consumed .

In some embodiments one of more of the value metric parameters included in the value metric may change over time. This may result in a change of the value metric or may result in a change in the relative value of a content currently preloaded or to be preloaded on a target storage. Examples of parameters that may change over time our list price specials promotions rebates user likelihood to consume etc. or any other parameters. In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume a particular content may change between the early morning morning lunch break afternoon evening etc. In some embodiments one or more of the value metric parameters included in the value metric may change with the user location or user device location etc. In some embodiments one or more of the value parameters included in the value metric may change with the user leisure mode. For example the user may be at work at a coffee shop having coffee in a park walking at an airport or on vacation etc. In some embodiments the ad revenue the communication network cost or likelihood to consume may change with user leisure mode.

In some embodiments the list of value metric parameters included in the value metric may change over time. This may result in a change of the value metric or may result in a change in the relative value of individual content currently preloaded or to be preloaded deleted on a target storage element. In some embodiments a relationship or weight between value metric parameters included in the value metric function may change over time. This may result in a change of the value metric or may result in a change in the relative value of individual content currently preloaded or to be preloaded deleted on a target device associated to a user.

In some embodiments the content distribution system includes a POI with a POI device. The POI device is owned by the POI or a content provider or a CP Broker POI service provider etc. The POI device is an access point or a gateway or a router or a set top box etc. The POI device may include storage. The storage associated to the POI device may be located within the POI device or attached to the POI device for example wired for example Ethernet or wirelessly for example WiFi .

In some embodiments value metrics associated to a POI are those that include one or more of value metric parameters value metric parameter relationships value metric parameter weights value metric functions of models that are intended to benefit a POI or from the point of view or perspective of a POI etc.

In this case the content preloaded onto the storage elements associated with the POI device may be of interest to a group of users within the coverage area of the POI the group of users is current or future or past users . In some embodiments the user likelihood to consume parameter may be exchanged for an expected number of users to consume value metric parameter. In some embodiments the communication network costs of preloading content onto the storage associated with the POI device may be shared by several users. In some embodiments the expected number of users to consume value parameter is modified based on a plurality of user for example number of users plurality of user profile plurality of user history plurality of likelihood to consume for a user plurality of subscription plans of a user etc. within the coverage area of the POI currently or at a later time . In some embodiments the expected number of users to consume parameter is modified based on the historical population of users frequenting this POI versus time. In some embodiments the value metric or value metric parameters are adapted more frequently for a POI. This may be advantageous because parameter values will likely be more dynamic for a group of users that a single user on a single user device. Moreover the communication network cost of frequent content changes may be amortized over more users.

In some embodiments the POI business owner manager modifies the value metric parameters or value metric relationships or weights included in the value metric function or model. In some embodiments the POI business owner manager modifies the content value metric functions to increase the POI business value metrics. In some embodiments a POI that is currently full for example a coffee shop with no available tables modifies the value metric function to reduce the value of content that takes a long time to consume or discontinue specials or increase price etc. In some embodiments a POI that is almost empty increases the likelihood that current patrons remain at the POI by reducing price of content offering content specials biasing the value metric functions to increase the quantity of sticky content that takes longer to consume for example streaming shows or movies etc.

In some embodiments the presentation at the user device of content preloaded at storage elements associated to a POI device may be customized to the user device or the user of the user device. For example the POI content may include sports and business news content. In some embodiments a user associated to a user device with interest in business news may have a different menu of preloaded content than a user with interest in sports. In some embodiments the presentation of content may include price specials etc. that may be customized to one of more of the users or user devices at the POI.

In some embodiments one or more parameters associated with a content consumed could include ads one or more users or one or more user devices located within the coverage area of POI access network in are shared with a POI business owner manager. In some embodiments these parameters may be used to enhance POI business value metrics. These business value metrics may be inventory quantity or mix of product offered at the POI specials etc.

In some embodiments one or more parameters associated with a content consumed or one or more users or one or more user devices located within the coverage area of POI access network are shared with a content provider or a POI service provider . This may be used by content provider to refine value metric parameters or value parameters weights relationships or value parameters included in a value metric for subsequent value metric evaluation for deleting existing content or preloading of new content etc. In some embodiments the content provider may use this information for refining business rules associated to a content.

In some embodiments one or more parameters associated with a content consumed one or more users or one or more user devices located within the coverage area of POI access network are shared with the content broker. This may be used by content broker to refine value parameters quantities or value parameters weights or value parameters included in value metric functions for subsequent value metric computation for deleting existing content or preloading of new content etc. In some embodiments this information may be used by content broker to assist content provider.

In some embodiments a communication network cost or some other parameter is a significant component of a value metric associated to preloading content onto storage or from storage to user devices. This cost to the value metric may be paid by one or more of a user communication network provider content provider content broker POI owner etc. This is more pronounced if the likelihood of consumption is low for example the communication network cost is wasted with very large probability or if the communication cost per byte is high for example over a cellular or cellular roaming access network. In some embodiments more than one communication network may be involved. In some embodiments a first communication network assists in preloading a first portion of the content from a source onto a storage element. In some embodiments a second communication network assists in preloading a second portion of the content from a source onto a storage element. In some embodiments the first portion is significantly larger than the second portion. In some embodiments the second portion is a security element that when merged or combined with the first portion enables consumption of the content at a user device. In some embodiments the first portion is significantly larger than the second portion and is preloaded onto the storage element over a less costly communication network. In some embodiments the first portion is significantly larger than the second portion and is preloaded onto the storage element over a faster communication network. In some embodiments a second communication network assists in preloading the content from a first storage element to a second storage element associated to a user device. The second storage element may be located within the enclosure of the user device. In some embodiments the communication network cost for assisting in preloading the content from a content source to a storage element associated with a user device is paid by a first party for example content provider and the cost of preloading from the storage element to a user device presentation element for example UI is paid by a second party for example user of user device . In some embodiments one or more of the cost of the communication networks described above are included in one or more of value metrics associated to a user a user device a content provider content broker POI etc.

In some embodiments a storage element device has access to a modem that could assist in preloading content that could connect to multiple communication networks of the same type for example WiFi but may have a different cost structure for example home WiFivs. airport pre pay WiFi . In some embodiments the storage element has access to a multimode modem for example a multiband 2G 3G with different cost structure for example home vs. roaming .
