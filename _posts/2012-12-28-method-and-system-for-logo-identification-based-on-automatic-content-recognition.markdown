title: Method and system for logo identification based on automatic content recognition
abstract: A method and system for logo identification based on automatic content recognition (ACR) are described in which a connected television (TV) or other end-user device may be provided with instructions to fingerprint certain regions in a video frame to identify the source of the content being displayed. Such instructions may be provided when, for example, fingerprint matching is able to identify content that is provided by multiple sources but is unable to identify the particular source of the content. In those instances, one or more additional locations may be determined for taking fingerprints in the video frame. These locations correspond to region of the video frame in which a graphical item that represents the network television station is typically displayed. A profile with these locations is generated and sent to the connected TV to take additional fingerprints to enable the identification of the network television station providing content.

This application makes reference to claims priority to and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 61 596 012 filed on Feb. 7 2012.

Each of the above referenced applications is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Certain embodiments of the invention relate to digital audio video content recognition. More specifically certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method and system for logo identification based on automatic content recognition.

Smart or connected televisions TVs may receive data from data networks that allow a viewer to not only access broadcast digital content but to also receive multimedia content.

Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art through comparison of such systems with some aspects of the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.

A method and system for logo identification based on automatic content recognition substantially as shown in and or described in connection with at least one of the figures as set forth more completely in the claims.

These and other advantages aspects and novel features of the present invention as well as details of an illustrated embodiment thereof will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.

Certain embodiments of the invention may be found in a method and system for an automatic content recognition ACR abstraction layer. Various embodiments of the invention provide for a system architecture that implements the ACR abstraction layer based on utilizing a real time event manager RTEM to communicate with multiple fingerprint servers. The RTEM can operate as a triggering mechanism that provides events i.e. event identifier and corresponding data to the multiple fingerprint servers RTFS s each of which associates the event s to the corresponding fingerprints of the broadcast network. Each RTFS may employ a different fingerprinting technology. At least portions of the system architecture can be synchronized using a network broadcast time server which is also referred to as a network protocol time NTP server. That is the RTEM and the fingerprinting servers can operate based on a common reference clock provided by the NTP server. Each of the fingerprint servers may generate a set of video fingerprints in real time from a network television feed by utilizing a video fingerprint technology that is different from the technology utilized by any of the other fingerprint servers. The different fingerprinting technologies may be from different fingerprinting vendors for example. The fingerprint servers may also be referred to as real time fingerprint servers RTFSs . A monitor application in the ACR system may be operable to assign one or more interactive event identifiers to the RTEM by associating an NTP broadcast time to a fingerprint that is then propagated to other fingerprint systems e.g. fingerprint servers via an application programming interface API . The fingerprint servers may communicate the sets of video fingerprints and interactive event identifiers to corresponding fingerprint match systems which in turn may communicate with devices that utilize the same video fingerprint technology as the corresponding fingerprint server.

The assignment of the event identifiers is based on a broadcast NTP time corresponding to each identified event. The event identifiers may provide information about different interactive events that may take place in a connected or smart TV. A connected TV may refer to for example a television that has internet access and or is capable of running applications. The event identifiers may also be referred to as interactive event identifiers IDs for example. The event identifiers may be determined in real time from a director s input for live programming apriori from a predetermined network schedule or from previously ingested content with interactivity defined e.g. offline content . When determined from previously ingested content the interactive event identifiers may be determined using a video fingerprinting process that is separate from those utilized by the fingerprint servers. This process may rely on any of the video fingerprinting technologies utilized by the fingerprint servers or on a different technology altogether

The abstraction layer may refer to for example the ability of an ACR system to assign the same event identifiers to different sets of video fingerprints that are generated by different video fingerprint technologies. That is by appropriately timing the assignment of event identifiers to multiple sequences of video fingerprints that are generated from the same video content but with different video fingerprinting technologies a single ACR system is able to support video fingerprinting technologies from multiple vendors. This approach allows the ACR system to be both flexible and scalable with respect to fingerprint technology vendors.

Fingerprinting and more particularly ACR fingerprinting may refer to a process by which features of a video frame or a set thereof and or of an audio frame or a set thereof may be analyzed to create representations i.e. fingerprints for each piece of content for example. The fingerprints may be unique to each piece or sequence of content and may be highly robust against broadcast distortions such as re encoding aspect ratio frame rate up down conversion and pitch correction to name a few. The fingerprints may be stored in a reference database in the ACR system such that unidentified content e.g. content from a live network television feed or broadcast may be identified by comparing fingerprints taken of the unidentified content with the stored fingerprints.

Once the event identifiers have been assigned by the monitor application and communicated to the real time fingerprint servers via the real time event manager the real time fingerprint servers may communicate the video fingerprints and the assigned event identifiers to corresponding fingerprint match systems. In some instances the fingerprint match systems may be operated by a third party e.g. television manufacturers vendors etc. as hosted services over the Internet e.g. cloud computing etc. . Each of the fingerprint match systems may communicate with devices e.g. connected TVs tablets smartphones etc. that utilize the same video fingerprint technology utilized by the fingerprint server that corresponds to that fingerprint match system. These devices may be referred to as viewer or end user devices for example.

The fingerprint match systems receive video fingerprints from the end user devices and compare them to the ones received from the real time fingerprint servers. When a match occurs the fingerprint match systems may notify the end user devices that an interactive event is to take place if there is an event identifier that corresponds to the matched video fingerprints.

As described above automatic content recognition may be utilized across several platforms including connected TVs from various manufacturers as well as smartphones and tablets. Since television viewing may be rapidly evolving from a single screen experience to a multiple screen experience television networks may need to automatically identify the context of what a viewer is watching and the time in the program both during a live television broadcast and in subsequent viewings such as when a program is being reproduced by a digital video recorder DVR . In multi screen viewing experiences for example companion applications on second screen devices may also be utilized to interact with the television programming by using fingerprint technology that is available in the second screen device or by pairing the second screen device with the connected TV.

Having the ability to identify context and program timing may enable a network to increase audience engagement extend viewing times and provide program sponsors additional ways to engage with the audience such as offering viewers personalized advertising offers or creating a second screen experience during an advertisement break. These features may be implemented by having a central video fingerprint repository and management platform that facilitates triggering interactive events across various platforms regardless of the ACR vendor solution e.g. fingerprinting technology . For example an ACR system may utilize a single broadcast ACR solution to support connected TVs from multiple vendors as well as second screen devices running companion applications.

There may be instances in which the vendors of connected TVs and supporting services are not able to associate an event with a fingerprint. Instead those vendors may support the association of the content being viewed with a timeline. Accordingly an ACR system may need to support timeline association in addition to event to fingerprint association. For timeline association for example the ACR system may be operable to create and provide a timeline that spans the duration of a program or show. The timeline can be distributed to the corresponding connected TVs supported by the vendors through vendor servers. With the timeline available the connected TV can launch an event when the appropriate point in the timeline is reached.

Below are described various examples of aspects related to an ACR system that utilizes an architecture based on the abstraction layer. These exemplary aspects may comprise the system architecture processes APIs and or web based services.

The ACR system may comprise an offline fingerprint module a monitor application module a real time event manager RTEM a plurality of RTFSs . . . fingerprint match systems end user devices an applications and analytics module and a timeline event creation module . In some instances at least some of the functions of the monitor application module and of the RTEM may be combined and may be provided by a common device or component of the ACR system .

The ACR system may also comprise an NTP server that is operable to provide synchronization to various parts of the ACR system via a common reference clock. For example the NTP server may be operable to synchronize the operation of the RTEM with the operation of the RTFSs . . . . The operations of the NTP server may be based on for example the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF RFC 5905 Network Time Protocol Version 4 Protocol and Algorithms Specification. 

The offline fingerprint module may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to handle the offline fingerprinting portion of the operations performed by the ACR system . The offline fingerprint module may be operable to receive pre recorded or offline content such as commercials programs and promotions for example. In this regard the offline fingerprint module may be able to ingest and process content with defined interactivity. The monitor application module may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to process a network television feed and the content handled by the offline fingerprint module to create a real time timeline and or real time event triggers. During the process the monitor application module and or the timeline event creation module may interact with backend analytics databases that comprise user engagement data for example. Some of the operations that may be performed by the offline fingerprint module may comprise for example ingest operations storage operations monitoring operations and or content version comparison operations.

The RTEM may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to manage real time events based on inputs provided by one or more sources. For example the RTEM may be operable to manage real time events based on events stored in an interactive timeline archive a network schedule and or those provided by an interactive director that may assign interactive event IDs to live programming as the network television feed is being fingerprinted in real time. Moreover the RTEM may be operable to trigger interactive events in legacy systems and or in web based systems. The RTEM may be referred to as a real time event trigger infrastructure for example. The RTEM may comprise a real time event inserter RTEI not shown which is operable to insert the events into the RTFSs . . . .

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the RTEM may be operable to instruct the monitor application module and or the timeline event creation module to record the fingerprints associated with a live program as well as to store the corresponding set of events created during the live program in the interactive timelime archive. This enables playback of the program with interactivity even after expiration of the corresponding fingerprints in the vendor s third party database. This may occur in instances when there is a re broadcast of the live event at a subsequent date. In the case of timeline based devices the events may be stored and timeline retrieval may be enabled even during the active window of the corresponding fingerprints since there will be no available event to fingerprint association.

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the RTEM may be operable to receive one or more inputs from a user e.g. an interactive director and to generate based on those inputs interactive event identifiers that can be communicated to the fingerprint servers where they can be associated with or assigned to the video fingerprints generated by the fingerprint servers. The RTEM may be operable to communicate the interactive event identifiers to a television system e.g. legacy system and or to a web system. The interactive event identifiers may be utilized in the television system and or in the web system to trigger interactive events. Moreover the communication of the interactive event identifiers may be based on one or more of an EBIF an HTTP live streaming HLS a satellite network protocol or some other protocol.

In an embodiment of the invention the Real time event manager may be operable to generate one or more signals that provide instructions to the RTFSs . . . to enable the identification of a network television station based on the logo symbol sign watermark and or text that are typically utilized to represent the network television station. The instructions may be related to information that is to be generated and or provided to the end user devices for network television station identification. The instructions may indicate the type of information that is to be provided to the end user devices and or when such information is to be provided. In some instances a portion of the ACR system other than the Real time event manager or in conjunction with the Real time event manager may generate the signals for providing instructions to the RTFSs . . . .

The RTFSs . . . may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to handle fingerprinting and fingerprint communications to the fingerprint match systems . Since each vendor or television manufacturer is likely to utilize its own fingerprint technology each of the RTFSs . . . may be a dedicated server for each of the fingerprint technologies supported by the ACR system . In some embodiments of the invention a portion of the RTFSs . . . may be operable to perform video fingerprinting while the remaining portion of the RTFSs . . . may be operable to perform audio fingerprinting or some combination thereof. Fingerprint technologies from multiple vendors may utilize different computations to perform fingerprinting of video and or audio frames. For example each fingerprint technology may utilize a specific set of algorithms parameters operations and or data processing methods for example.

In an embodiment of the invention the RTFSs . . . may be operable to receive one or more signals from the Real time event manager and or from another portion of the ACR system to enable the identification of a network television station based on the logo symbol sign watermark and or text that are typically utilized to represent the network television station. The instructions may be utilized to determine and or provide locations to the end user devices to take fingerprints of the video content being displayed on a viewing screen. In some instances at least a portion of the fingerprinting locations may be provided by the Real time event manager and or by another portion of the ACR system through the instructions received by the RTFSs . . . . In other instances the fingerprinting locations may be determined by the RTFSs . . . based on locally and or remotely stored information. Each fingerprinting location may comprise coordinates in a video frame e.g. x coordinates y coordinates that indicate a particular region in the video frame to fingerprint.

The RTFSs . . . may provide the fingerprinting locations for communication to the end user devices for example in the form of fingerprint profiles. The fingerprint profiles may comprise fingerprinting locations and or other information to be utilized by an end user device for ACR fingerprinting. In some instances the fingerprint profiles may be generated by the RTFSs . . . in response to the instructions received. In other instances the fingerprint profiles comprising the fingerprinting locations may be received by the RTFSs . . . from the Real time event manager and or from another portion of the ACR system . The fingerprint profile of a particular end user device may be updated based on an indication that additional and or different locations may be needed during fingerprinting to identify the network television station logo or symbol being displayed on a viewing screen at the end user device . The update may be generated by the corresponding RTFS and then communicated to the end user device or may be received by the corresponding RTFS from the Real time event manager and or from another portion of the ACR system and then communicated to the end user device .

The indication that a fingerprint profile update may be needed may be the result of network operations that recognize that certain content is being broadcast by several network television stations concurrently e.g. State of the Union address . In such instances the fingerprinting locations being utilized may not analyze the region in a video frame where the logo of the network television station is displayed. Thus providing additional fingerprinting locations in this region may enable detection and identification of the logo and consequently of the network television station.

The indication that a fingerprint profile update may be needed may also be the result of feedback provided by an end user device . The feedback may indicate for example that the content being displayed has been identified but that the content may have originated in any one of several sources and the particular source of the content has not been identified. In such instances the fingerprinting locations being utilized may not analyze the region in a video frame where the logo of the network television station is displayed. Thus providing additional fingerprinting locations in this region may enable detection and identification of the logo and consequently of the source of the content.

In some instances the fingerprint profile and or the fingerprint profile update received by an end user device may comprise information that indicates to the end user device that any additional fingerprinting locations may be utilized automatically when the source e.g. network television station of a particular content is not initially identified.

In one or more embodiments of the invention the RTFSs . . . may be operable to communicate fingerprint profiles and or fingerprint profile updates to the end user devices through the fingerprint match systems . Feedback and or queries from the end user devices may be received by the RTFSs . . . for processing. The RTFSs . . . may in turn communicate information corresponding to the feedback and or queries from the end user devices to the Real time event manager and or to another portion of the ACR system for further processing.

The fingerprint match systems may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to enable hosted services in the Internet for matching fingerprints produced by the RTFSs . . . with fingerprints produced by the end user devices . Each of the fingerprint match systems corresponds to a particular ACR or fingerprint technology. In this regard each of the fingerprint match systems may be supported by a third party such as a TV manufacturer for example.

The fingerprint match systems may be operable to compare fingerprints produced by the end user devices with fingerprints provided by the RTFSs . . . . When matches occur the fingerprint match systems may indicate that interactive events are to take place in the end user devices . These interactive events may allow a viewer to be presented with information on the screen or display of an ACR based device and to interact with the device based on the information presented.

The end user devices may comprise a plurality of devices such as connected TVs connected TV with paired devices e.g. tablets and second screen devices such as smartphones and tablets for example. The ACR based devices may be referred to as end user devices for example. Since each of the fingerprint match systems supports a different ACR or fingerprint technology those end user devices that support a particular fingerprint technology are operable to communicate with the corresponding fingerprint match systems that support the same fingerprint technology. Moreover when a secondary or paired device that supports a particular fingerprint technology is used that device may also be able to communicate with the corresponding fingerprint match system that supports the compatible fingerprint technology.

The end user devices may be operable to receive and utilize a fingerprint profile and or a fingerprint profile update and to take fingerprints in a pre determined number of locations in a video frame. Each fingerprinting location may be defined by a set of coordinates that describe a region in the video frame where a fingerprint of the video content is to be taken. The end user devices may be operable to receive a series of fingerprint profiles and or fingerprint profile updates and may be operable to adjust ACR fingerprinting accordingly.

The applications and analytics module may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to provide data to the end user devices determine what platforms are to be served and when these platforms are to be served handle communications with third party partners and advertisers handle communication with backend analytics databases and determine unique responses for a given device request e.g. fix targeting .

The timeline event creation module may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to produce a timeline of the content in a program or show based on information provided by the monitor application module . The timeline event creation module may then provide the timeline created to the applications and analytics module to have the timeline disseminated to the appropriate End user devices that may not support event to fingerprint association. Once the End user devices have the timeline for a particular program or show they may monitor the program or show relative to the timeline and launch appropriate event requests when a specified point in the timeline indicates that a particular event is to take place.

Communication between the RTFSs . . . and the fingerprint match systems may occur through one or more wireless and or wireline communication links. Similarly communications between the fingerprint match systems and the end user devices and or the applications and analytics module may occur through one or more wireless and or wireline communication links. The communication links described above may support one or more communication protocols. For example communication protocols based on Internet Protocol IP may be typically used. Accordingly the RTFSs . . . the fingerprint match systems and the applications and analytics module may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces to enable the use of the communication protocols.

In operation the monitor application module and or the RTEM may generate and or handle event identifiers or event triggers that correspond to specific times in a program. These event identifiers may be generated from live programming from a network schedule or from information provided by the offline fingerprint module . The event identifiers may be assigned to the appropriate fingerprints generated by the RTFSs . . . . Since each RTFS relies on a different fingerprint technology system synchronization is needed to appropriately assign the event identifiers to the right spot on a video and or audio sequence. Such synchronization may be achieved by the use of a common reference clock provided by the NTP server .

Each of the RTFSs . . . may communicate the event identifiers and the fingerprints to its corresponding one of the fingerprint match systems . The fingerprint match systems in turn receive fingerprints from their corresponding end user devices and try to match those fingerprints to the ones received from their corresponding RTFSs . . . . When a match occurs the event identifier and or other information may be passed to the appropriate ACR based device. With this information the ACR based device may obtain for example interactive information e.g. graphics from the applications and analytics module . For example a connected TV may receive code or data specific for that device from a content management system CMS via a cloud based content delivery network CDN . There may be other actions performed by the user in connection with the interactive event and or other information presented or produced in connection with the interactive event.

In operation the ACR system may generate a fingerprint profile that may be communicated to one of the end user devices . The fingerprint profile may be communicated through one or more of the Real time event manager one of the RTFSs . . . and one of the fingerprint match systems . The fingerprint profile may comprise locations where the end user device is to take fingerprints of the video content being reproduced by the device. Once the content is identified based on the fingerprints taken and subsequently matched in the corresponding fingerprint match system it may be determined that the source of the content is not known. Knowing the source of the content may be needed in some instances to enable interactive events associated with that source on the end user device. Otherwise an interactive event from for example one network television station may occur when a viewer is watching programming provided by a different network television station.

When the source of the content is not known the end user device may automatically utilize additional locations provided in the fingerprint profile or in a fingerprint profile update. These locations may correspond to the region in the video frame where the network television station logo or symbol is typically placed. Once these fingerprints are taken they may be compared to fingerprints of the network television station logo or symbol at the corresponding fingerprint match systems . When a match occurs and the logo is identified the end user device may be able to receive interactive event identifiers from the corresponding RTFS. Once these interactive event identifiers are received the end user device may communicate with the applications and analytics module to enable the interactive events to occur.

Also shown in are various end user devices such as connected TVs with paired devices and connected TVs without paired devices and mobile devices such as smartphones e.g. iPhone Android etc. and tablets e.g. iPad Samsung Galaxy etc. . A paired device associated with the connected TVs may be a tablet smartphone or other like devices for example.

The end user devices may be operable to utilize the same video fingerprinting technology e.g. video ACR utilized by the video RTFS and supported by the video fingerprint vendor . The video fingerprint vendor may be a vendor manufacturer or other third party service provider that may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces operable to provide hosted services over the Internet e.g. cloud computing etc. for the end user devices . These services may comprise video fingerprint matching as well as the delivery of any interactive event IDs associated with a match. The services may also comprise the communication of fingerprint profiles and or other related information to the end user devices and or the reception of feedback and or queries from the end user devices to be communicated to the video RTFS . In addition the video fingerprint vendor may provide a network television station identifier and or network timing information e.g. heartbeat message or NTP based network timestamp that may be utilized by the end user devices for ACR related applications and or to maintain synchronization with the network television feed. The end user devices may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to take and send video fingerprints to the video fingerprint vendor for matching.

The end user devices may be operable to utilize the same video fingerprinting technology utilized by the video RTFS and supported by the video fingerprint vendor . The video fingerprinting technology utilized by the end user devices may be different from that utilized by the end user devices . The video fingerprint vendor may be a vendor manufacturer or other third party service provider that may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces operable to provide hosted services over the internet for the end user devices . These services may comprise video fingerprint matching as well as the delivery of any interactive event IDs associated with a match.

The end user devices may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to take and send video fingerprints to the video fingerprint vendor for matching.

The end user devices and may be operable with a second device e.g. smartphones tablets that may be paired to the parent device. In this regard the second device may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to take and send video and or audio fingerprints to a corresponding video fingerprint vendor for matching or enable suitable pairing with the parent device to provide analogous functionality.

The end user devices may utilize the same video fingerprinting technology utilized by the video RTFS and supported by the video fingerprint vendor . The video fingerprint vendor may be a vendor manufacturer or other third party service provider that may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces operable to provide hosted services over the Internet for the end user devices . These services may comprise video fingerprint matching as well as the delivery of any interactive event IDs associated with a match. In addition the video fingerprint vendor may provide a network television station identifier and or network timing information that may be utilized by the end user devices for ACR related applications and or to maintain synchronization with the network television feed. The end user devices may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to take and send video fingerprints to the video fingerprint vendor for matching.

The end user devices may utilize the same audio fingerprinting technology e.g. audio ACR utilized by the audio RTFS and supported by the audio fingerprint vendor . The end user devices may be referred to as second screen devices for example. The audio fingerprint vendor may be a vendor manufacturer or other third party service provider that may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces operable to provide hosted services over the Internet for the end user devices . These services may comprise audio fingerprint matching as well as the delivery of any interactive event IDs associated with a match. The services may also comprise the communication of audio fingerprint profiles and or other related information to the end user devices and or the reception of feedback and or queries from the end user devices to be communicated to the audio RTFS . Audio fingerprint profiles may comprise information related to the characteristics e.g. segments frequencies of the audio fingerprints to be taken by the end user devices . In addition the audio fingerprint vendor may provide a network television station identifier and or network timing information that may be utilized by the end user devices for ACR related applications and or to maintain synchronization with the network television feed. The end user devices may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to take and send audio fingerprints to the audio fingerprint vendor for matching.

The RTFSs . . . may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to perform fingerprinting of content received from the network television feeds. Each video RTFS may utilize a different video fingerprinting technology or computation from that utilized by the other video RTFSs. Similarly when more than one audio RTFS is utilized its audio fingerprint technology or computation may be different from that utilized by the other audio RTFSs. That is since each vendor supports a different technology for handling fingerprinting dedicated RTFSs may be needed for each vendor and for that vendor s corresponding end user devices. The RTFSs . . . may be operable to send fingerprints interactive event IDs television network station identifiers and or network timing information to their corresponding fingerprint vendors through one or more networks e.g. wireline networks wireless networks and or by utilizing one or more communication protocols.

The RTFSs . . . may be operable to handle instructions and or information that enable the identification of a network television station based on the logo symbol sign watermark and or text that are typically utilized to represent the network television station. In this regard the RTFSs . . . may be operable to handle instructions and or information as described above with respect to the RTFSs . . . that are illustrated in for example.

The RTEM may comprise suitable logic circuitry code and or interfaces that may be operable to perform real time event triggering. In this regard the RTEM may be operable to manage real time events based on inputs from different sources. For example the RTEM may comprise a pre recorded event trigger module to provide real time triggering from the monitor application module shown in a time scheduled event trigger module to schedule the occurrence of a trigger based on a broadcast schedule and a live event trigger module each of which is operable to handle a different type of input.

The pre recorded event trigger module may be operable to receive real time event triggers from the timeline event creation module described above with respect to . These interactive event IDs may be stored in the interactive timeline archive and may be utilized by the pre recorded event trigger module to assign interactive events via for example defined APIs to fingerprints generated as the network television feeds are fingerprinted by the RTFSs . . . .

The time scheduled event trigger module may be operable to receive a network or broadcast schedule and to assign based on the network schedule interactive events to fingerprints generated as the network television feed is fingerprinted by the RTFSs . . . . The network or broadcast schedule can be in XML format or in some other structured data format for example.

The live event trigger module may be operable to received interactive event IDs assigned by an interactive director to live programming. The interactive director may be an operator that is responsible for inserting events into the live broadcast. For pre produced content for example the interactive director may watch an episode and may determine when an interactive element is to take place when to push a trivia question when to push a fun fact when to drive social engagement and or when to share a clip or post a comment. For live content for example the interactive director may determine when to trigger a poll question and may manage the prompting of interactive games and determine when to trigger particular questions to engage viewers in a friendly competition. For advertisement for example the interactive director may determine when to bring up an offer when to prompt to prepare for interaction or interaction event and or determine how long to leave interactive content on screen based on frequency rules and or time of day. When advertisement is pre fingerprinted for example interactive advertisement activities may occur automatically.

The RTEM may also be operable to trigger interactive events in legacy television systems and or in web based systems. The infrastructure provided by the RTEM may support the triggering of interactive events against applications and set top boxes STBs via enhanced television binary interchange format EBIF hypertext transfer protocol HTTP live streaming HLS via ID3 tags and satellite delivery systems e.g. DISH DirectTV via the appropriate mechanism on the corresponding STB software platform. For HLS an ID3 tag may be utilized for sending interactive event IDs for example.

The RTEM may be operable to assign interactive event IDs to particular fingerprints in a sequence of audio or video fingerprints generated by the RTFSs . . . . The RTEM may also be operable to provide television network station identifiers and or network timing information associated with any sequence of fingerprints.

In the example shown in the RTFSs . . . may correspond to the RTFSs . . . the fingerprint vendors . . . may correspond to the fingerprint match systems and the end user devices . . . may correspond to the end user devices which are illustrated in .

The RTEM may be operable to handle instructions and or information that enable the identification of a network television station based on the logo symbol sign watermark and or text that are typically utilized to represent the network television station. In this regard the Real time event manager may be operable to handle instructions and or information as described above with respect to the Real time event manager that is illustrated in for example.

In operation the RTEM may generate and or handle one or more interactive event IDs that correspond to a particular set of fingerprints generated by the RTFSs . . . . The RTEM may have determined the interactive event IDs based on live event inputs time scheduled event inputs and or pre recorded event inputs. The RTEM may assign or associate the interactive event IDs to their appropriate fingerprints based on the synchronization of its operation to the operation of the RTFSs . . . via broadcast NTP. The RTEM may also provide television network station identifiers and or network timing information to the RTFSs . . . . The RTFSs . . . may communicate the fingerprints interactive event IDs the television network station identifiers and or the network timing information to their corresponding fingerprint vendors.

The client or end user devices may take and send fingerprints to their corresponding fingerprint vendors which in turn determine whether there is a match with the fingerprints received from the RTFSs. Upon detection or determination of a match the fingerprint vendors may return to the viewer device various pieces of information including but not limited to network timing information and any interactive event ID that is triggered as a result of the match.

The portion in may also illustrate the implementation of an abstraction layer that enables the ACR system to assign the same interactive event identifiers to different sets of video and or audio fingerprints that are generated from different fingerprint technologies. That is by appropriately timing the assignment of interactive event identifiers to multiple sequences of fingerprints that are generated from the same video content but with different fingerprinting technologies the ACR system may be able to support fingerprinting technologies from multiple vendors. Such implementation may provide flexibility by enabling a vendor to update its fingerprinting technology without affecting other fingerprinting technologies.
