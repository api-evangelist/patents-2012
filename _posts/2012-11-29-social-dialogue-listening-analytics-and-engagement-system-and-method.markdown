In an embodiment the topics may be generated by a natural language process NLP analysis and categorization of the SM data that comprises the SLA set or subset.

A SM conversation sentiment positive neutral and negative may be determined by natural language processing of captured SMP data and searching for common terms related positive neutral and negative sentiment or expression. The sentiment analysis may correlate the sentiment terms and the user provided search terms based on modifiers and word distance between the terms. An application user via display F may limit captured conversations to have a particular sentiment F based on the sentiment determination. The SLAE system may determine a SM conversation or post s relevance based on natural language processing of the conversation or post in relation to the user provided search terms including the frequency and context of the search terms in the conversation or posts.

A user may provide a list of one or more brands F whose mention they may want noted or present in captured SM streams conversations or posts.
