title: Dynamic media transcoding at network edge
abstract: A set of transcoding techniques are described for encoding media content on the fly based on device requesting the content. A copy of media content (video or audio file) is stored at a content delivery network (CDN) point-of-presence (POP) server or some other network edge server device. When a device requests the content, the CDN POP server determines the type of device based on the information contained in the request and transcodes the content on-the-fly into the correct encoding for that particular type of device when providing the content to the device. For example, if the requesting device is recognized to be a mobile phone having a particular operating system, the edge server can transcode the media content into the format suitable to display at the mobile phone using that particular operating system. The transcoding can be performed dynamically at the time of transmitting the content to the device.

In recent years there has been a surge of development and releases of new types of mobile devices made available to the public. Today s consumer is often equipped with a smart phone tablet MP3 player or other device that can be used to access the internet download and view digital media e.g. video and audio files and perform a wide variety of other functions. Given such large numbers of devices and device types it is quickly becoming a non trivial task to make media content available to all of the consumers across their various devices. In fact many companies are spending large fractions of their time and resources managing scaling and maintaining media processing systems that may have nothing to do with their core business. These companies are looking for encoding systems and services that can provide the best video audio quality to consumers at a low cost. Because digital video and audio content is often delivered to multiple device types over unmanaged networks with fluctuating bandwidth it is desirable to utilize transcoding to produce a version of each asset to accommodate these variants.

Transcoding is the decoding and recoding of digital content from one format to another. Transcoding is often necessary to enable playback of media on different devices. It can be used to convert a digital audio video file and video streams from one digital form or codec to another e.g. MPEG2 to h.264 transcoding . Transcoding can also be used to adjust the bit rate of a video file and resize video resolution. Transcoding takes place in order for content to reach multi screen end user destinations. The complexity of transcoding comes from the vast range of devices networks and channels that may need to be supported.

A content delivery network CDN is an interconnected network of computer nodes that contain copies of various types of data. Using a CDN can improve access to the data cached at the nodes by increasing access bandwidth redundancy and reducing access latency. CDNs are often used to provide access to media content.

In the following description various embodiments will be illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings. References to various embodiments in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one. While specific implementations and other details are discussed it is to be understood that this is done for illustrative purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the claimed subject matter.

Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of the foregoing or other deficiencies experienced in conventional approaches for transcoding content. In particular various embodiments provide approaches for dynamically transcoding media at the network edge based on the type of the device requesting the content.

In accordance with various embodiments a transcoding system or service is described for encoding media content on the fly based at least in part on the device requesting the content. A copy of media content e.g. an audio video or multimedia file can be stored at a location such as a server located at the network edge e.g. content delivery network CDN point of presence POP . When a device requests the media content a component such as an edge server located at the POP inspects the request and determines the type of requesting device based on information associated with the request e.g. hypertext transfer protocol HTTP headers of the request parameters associated with the request metadata associated with the request or any other information contained in the request . Alternatively the edge server may determine the type of operating system OS browser or application that is associated with the request wherein that OS browser or application may have a particular encoding format that it can use to render the media content.

Once the request has been inspected the edge server can transcode the content on the fly into the appropriate encoding for the particular device type or OS application or browser type before delivering a copy of the requested media to the device. For example if the requesting device is recognized to be an iPhone the edge server may transcode the media file into a format suitable for display on the iPhone as least as determined approximately at the time in which the content is to be transmitted to the device. In some embodiments the transcoding can be performed at the time when the content is being transmitted to the device in response to the request. For example the edge server may be transcoding the media content while bits of the transcoded content is concurrently being transmitted to the device. In various embodiments the edge server can be a cache server at the POP a dedicated transcoding server or any other device capable of transcoding media that resides at the network edge location such as the POP.

As illustrated a service provider environment can include a variety of devices and components for receiving and processing requests from various users across one or more networks . As discussed access to these resources can be provided as one or more services such as Web services. In this example the service provider environment includes a plurality of resources such as data storage resources and request processing resources that can be deployed in one or more resource centers in one or more locations and made accessible over the one or more networks . As used throughout this disclosure a network can be any wired or wireless network of devices that are capable of communicating with each other including but not limited to the Internet or other Wide Area Networks WANs cellular networks Local Area Networks LANs Storage Area Networks SANs Intranets Extranets and the like. The resource centers can include any physical or logical grouping of resources such as a data center a server farm content delivery network CDN point of presence POP and the like.

In accordance with various embodiments resource centers of the service provider may include various computer servers data storage machines network devices and other hardware resources necessary to provide the network accessible services on behalf of the clients of the service provider. For example as shown in the resource centers can include physical servers and other devices located in a particular geographical location which enable the service provider to transcode process and or deliver media content to viewer devices . In accordance with an embodiment a resource center can include media cache servers transcoding servers watermarking servers and the like. The view of one of the resource centers is shown in an exploded view to provide further illustration of the types of resources that can be contained in a resource center in accordance with various embodiments. It should be noted that the resources can reside in one resource center or can alternatively be distributed across multiple resource centers.

In accordance with various embodiments the service provider offers a media transcoding and processing service in addition to many other services discussed herein. In one embodiment the media transcoding and processing service can perform the transcoding jobs of media content stored in data stores e.g. source store destination store of the service provider . In alternative embodiments the media transcoding and processing service may perform various other functions such as transmuxing the media adding security information e.g. watermarks to the media translating the media or adding subtitles and the like.

In accordance with an embodiment components of the service provider environment enable a content publisher to provide e.g. upload a media file to a source store and to schedule the transcoding jobs to be performed thereon. In various embodiments the source store may be located on the resource center of the service provider or on a remote system such as the system of the content publisher . As an example the content publisher can upload content such as a media file to a source store and specify that a set of selected workflows should be applied to the media file. A workflow can apply a particular profile s to the media content. In accordance with an embodiment a profile contains all the information e.g. settings parameters etc. that may be necessary to transcode the media content into the specific encoding format for a particular device operating system or application. For example one or more profiles can be provided to transcode certain types of media content into formats suitable for iPhone IOS Android Microsoft Windows Phone and other mobile device operating systems. The media transcoding and processing service then carries out the workflow including potentially transcoding the media content stored on a source store into the appropriate encodings. Once workflow is complete the resulting media content can be placed into a destination store . The destination store may be located on the resource center of the service provider or a remote system such as the system of the content publisher or other entity such as the content receiver . As such in this example the media content located in the destination source has had the workflow applied. From the destination store the media content can be made available to a content receiver or the various viewer devices for download. In alternative embodiments the processed content could be made available to any other entities including the content publisher or third party service providers.

It should be noted that the term transcoding is often associated with a profile or a workflow in this disclosure however the profiles workflows and various other features of this disclosure are not limited to changing the encoding format of media and in some embodiments may not include changing the encoding format at all. For example a profile or workflow may include transmuxing digital watermarking segmenting applying access controls adding meta data inserting advertisements translating into various languages transcribing changing bit rates sequencing changing or adding audio associated with a video or modifying customizing or making compatible various other features of content in any other manner. By way of illustration one workflow could include segmenting a video file for multi bitrate support and adding audio to the video file and another workflow could include digital watermarking and applying access controls to the file. In accordance with the present disclosure transcoding may often be a part of various workflows but is not a required part of every workflow discussed herein.

In accordance with an embodiment the transcoding service can execute the transcoding jobs using the compute instances of the service provider. In one embodiment each compute instance is a virtual server resource or virtual node having a specific processing capacity and memory associated therewith which allows the service provider to meter the usage of the transcoding service by each client e.g. the service provider may charge per hour of computing resource consumed . In an alternative embodiment the compute instances can be actual server machines in the data center maintained by the service provider and leased to its customers e.g. content publisher .

It should be noted that while illustrates a source store and a destination store located in resource center the locations of such stores are not limited to any particular resource center server or physical computing device. It will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art that various stores storage containers servers compute instances transcoding services and other resources described herein can be located in any resource center or distributed across multiple resource centers or geographical locations allowing data or content to be replicated across all or some of the devices therein. For example the resource center could be in Europe the resource center could be Asia and the resource center could be in the United States. In various embodiments the various storage containers servers compute instances transcoding services and other resources described herein could also reside on a single device.

In accordance with various embodiments the transcoding service can provide content publishers with an automated transcoding and workflow system that is reliable and scalable. The content publishers may define the transcoding parameters on their own or leverage a set of predefined common device profiles that are provided by the service provider. The transcoding service can allow the content publishers to upload content to the storage instance define a workflow store the resulting encoded assets on the service provider s system and deliver their media assets to viewers or others for example via a content delivery network CDN of the service provider. In other examples the media assets are made available or delivered to third parties for distributing the media assets or for providing additional services.

Generally a content publisher e.g. customer of the service provider can register for an account by signing up for example with the service provider to gain access to media transcoding and processing service. Once an account is created media assets e.g. video files to be transcoded are placed into an input store on the service provider. A workflow can be defined using an application programming interface API or console for example to initiate a transcoding job which will be carried out using one or more of the compute instances . The resulting transcoded object s are placed into a defined output store or some other specified location such as a location on the system of the content publisher or the content receiver . Alternatively the transcoding service can cache the media assets at the network edge and perform the transcoding dynamically on a per request basis depending on the type of requesting device.

In various embodiments the media transcoding and processing service can accept media content in a wide variety of incoming formats and can convert the content into a comprehensive collection of output encodings. For example the transcoding service can transcode to the media to formats suitable for common devices such as Android and Apple IOS based devices Flash and HTML5 platforms by providing a set of pre defined device profiles. The pre defined profiles can be leveraged by the content publisher when setting up a job via the API or via the graphical console. These profiles can be used as is or modified into a custom profile to be reusable for subsequent transcoding job requests.

The content publisher may be any content creator content distributor user generated content publisher or any other entity that possess media content and desires to make that content available to viewers or other entities. Examples of content creators may be motion picture studios universities producing educational content private organizations producing internal video content and other organizations such as online real estate and auto sales companies producing videos to increase sales. Content distributors may be cable and television service providers music distributors movie purveyors and the like. Examples of user generated content publishers may be social media companies video uploading services and any other entity that stores content on behalf of its viewers. The content receiver can be any entity that is provided with content that has been transcoded or otherwise processed by the transcoding service. For example the content receiver may be a third party movie distributor that wishes to provide the transcoded video content on its own website.

In accordance with an embodiment the service provider can provide a content repository for all types of media files for transcoding and encoding. By focusing on the particular requirements of content publishers e.g. multiple input types scale to handle spikes and a vast range of delivery targets the transcoding service can provide a solution that can help any type of customer or entity of the service provider.

In accordance with various embodiments the service provider may implement a number of pricing models for using the transcoding service. As one option the pricing of transcoding service could be based on the usage of compute instances that are utilized by the content publisher . For example on demand transcoding instances can let customers of the service provider pay for compute capacity by the hour that their transcoding instance runs. This can free the content publisher from the costs and complexities of planning purchasing and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs into much smaller variable costs.

As an alternative option the content publishers can use reserved transcoding instances. When using reserved transcoding instances content publishers make a one time up front payment for each transcoding instance they wish to reserve for a long period of time e.g. 1 3 year term . In return the customer may be given a discount off the ongoing hourly usage rate for the transcoding instances.

As an alternative option a set of spot instances could be utilized. In accordance with an embodiment spot instances enable a content publisher to bid on and purchase unused capacity of the compute instances of other customers at a market place. In some embodiments instances sold on the spot market may be reclaimed at any moment if they are needed for customers that have previously reserved the computing capacity. Spot instances may be especially useful for handling seasonal or project peak demand and large library re encodes for new codecs. In some cases the spot instances may be used for transcoding jobs that are not extremely urgent because using those instances may incur the risk that other users may be using them and therefore none of the spot instances are available. In other cases however using spot instances may be an effective way to get extremely urgent work performed cheaply if there is a significant number of spot instances available. Taking advantage of low bid opportunities for instances can enable a customer e.g. content publisher with pricing advantages they have not been offered without building out transcoding services on their own.

As an alternative option pricing by gigabyte or other unit of transcoded content output may be employed by the transcoding service. In accordance with an embodiment gigabyte GB usage could be calculated by adding the size of the input file and the combined size of the output files. For example if a 1 GB file were to be transcoded into two formats each producing a 0.5 GB file the total amount billed would be 2 GB.

As an alternative option the transcoding service could charge by output video minutes e.g. the cumulative minutes of the output transcoded media . Calculation of content length in minutes by the number of output formats could give customers an expectation of what they will be billed. The transcoding service could control the number of unique compute instances that would be launched to support a transcoding job since licensing costs may be determined by the number of instances launched for a given user.

As mentioned above the transcoding service can be configured to accept media content in a wide variety of incoming formats and can convert the content into a comprehensive collection of output encodings including various media formats and bitrates. The media transcoding and processing service could include an API user portal or graphical user interface GUI that includes locations stores for a content publisher to upload media files. The input store may include any storage bucket container directory memory location or any other place where media can be located. In some embodiments the input store could have a unique profile associated therewith for transcoding the media file to produce an output of the media file in various predefined media formats. There could be an input location for commonly used profiles and for combinations of commonly used profiles. Alternatively the workflows and profiles can be selected and applied based on various attributes of the media file e.g. file name metadata etc. rather than being associated with the input store itself.

As previously described a content publisher can provide the media content to the source store or some other storage location provided by the service provider . The service provider can then transfer the media content to a cache server or another server residing at the network edge location such as a content delivery network CDN point of presence POP . The transfer may make access to the media more efficient for users proximate to the POP. In an alternative embodiment the content publisher may provide the media content directly to the POP from a location on the content publisher . As previously mentioned the CDN of the service provider may include a plurality of POPs such as POP which may be geographically distributed to various locations that are proximate to the end users and devices. Several POPs can use the same internet protocol IP address and the routing scheme can be utilized that to find a POP that is the closest to an end user in terms of network hops required to reach it. It should be noted that while the source store is shown as being located outside of POP in this is not intended to be a limitation to the various embodiments described herein. In some embodiments the source store may be located at the same POP and therefore may not need to be transferred. In other embodiments the source store may be located at another POP or other resource center and the transfer of the media content from the source store to the POP may occur in response to receiving the request for the media content at POP . Alternatively the transfer of the media content from the source store to POP may be performed automatically upon placement of the media content into the source store.

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment POP can include a number of cache servers capable of storing a copy of the media content locally to be made available to the various requesting devices. In addition the POP may include a transcoding service . When a viewer device e.g. device requests the media content from the POP the request can be inspected to determine a device type and other information such as application type OS type browser type etc. associated with the requesting viewer based on information contained in the request. For example based on the HTTP header information contained in the request it may be determined that the device requesting the media file is an Apple iPhone running a particular version of the Apple IOS operating system. In accordance with various embodiments each device type can be associated with a particular type of encoding format that is suitable to display or render the media file on that device based on the OS application display resolution settings etc. . In addition a profile may be associated with the device type and may contain all of the processing settings and parameters necessary to transcode the media content into the format appropriate for the device. In various embodiments a variety of information contained in the request can be used to select the type of format for transcoding the media content. For example request parameters uniform resource locator URL of the request request metadata or any other data embedded in the request or received along with the request may be used in this determination.

In accordance with an embodiment once the type of device requesting the content is identified the POP can make a determination whether the copy of the media content is in the appropriate format for being displayed on the requesting device . If the media content is already in the appropriate format the cache server can simply provide the cached copy to the requesting device . If on the other hand the media file is not in the correct format to be displayed on the requesting device the cache server can provide the media content to the transcoding server having a transcoding engine to perform dynamic transcoding of the media content . In accordance with an embodiment the transcoding service may transcode the media content based at least in part on the device type and various performance characteristics associated with the device. For example once the device type is identified the appropriate settings and parameters for transcoding the media may be selected based on the screen display capabilities of the requesting device which version of the operating system the device is running the processing capacity of the device available memory on the device and the like.

In accordance with an embodiment the transcoding service can utilize a graphics processing unit GPU configuration to transcode the media content in an optimal performance manner. For example the transcoding server can use the compute unified device architecture CUDA as the computing engine in the GPU to encode the video content into the appropriate format for the requesting device. It should be noted that as previously mentioned the term transcoding is not necessarily limited to changing the format of the media content but may also include performing such functions as transmuxing digital watermarking segmenting applying access controls adding meta data inserting advertisements translating into various languages transcribing changing bit rates sequencing changing or adding audio associated with a video or modifying customizing or making compatible various other features of content in any other manner. For example if a requesting device is not able to handle a certain quality video stream or a certain data transfer rate the transcoding server may adjust the quality of the video stream or the data transfer rate to accommodate the device.

In accordance with an embodiment the transcoding server can transcode the media content on the fly into the correct encoding format when responding to the request by transmitting bits of the media content to device . For example the transcoding server can stream the bits that have been encoded into the proper format to the device while the transcoding engine is transcoding the remaining bits of the media file. In accordance with one embodiment the POP can utilize an initial burst mode to stream the beginning portion of the media file transcoded at one bit rate and then complete the remaining portion of the media file at a different bit rate. This can help avoid any latency on the part of the requesting device that may be viewing the media content as it is being transcoded and streamed to it.

In accordance with an embodiment if the transcoding service detects that the requesting device has ceased downloading the media the dynamic transcoding can be terminated in order to save the computing resources of the POP . For example if the user stops viewing the video file the transcoding server can halt the transcoding process and apply the GPU resource to other transcoding jobs that may be needed.

In some embodiments the transcoding service may select and perform the transcoding based at least in part on various network conditions such as bandwidth jitter packets lost or the like. For example if the network bandwidth is low due to high amounts of traffic data the transcoding service may opt to transcode the media content at a lower bit rate or lower resolution in order to deliver the media content more efficiently to the requesting device.

As shown in operation the service provider can enable a customer to provide media content to an input store as described in connection with . For example the service provider can expose APIs or provide a graphical interface for the content owners and content publishers to upload their media content to an input store on one of the servers maintained by the service provider. The media content file that is uploaded may be in a particular encoding format such as MPEG2 for example.

In operation once the media content has been uploaded to the input store or some other storage location by the content publisher the media content can be optionally cached at the various content delivery network POPs. In some embodiments the caching of the media content can be performed automatically upon receiving the file or at a time that the media is requested and provided to users at the various POPs. In other embodiments the media content is not cached at a cache server.

In operation the network edge e.g. POP can receive a request for the media content from a requesting device. For example the request can be received from a viewer on a mobile phone wanting to stream and view the video content or may be requested from a personal computer PC utilizing a web browser or any other approach utilized by the various viewers. In accordance with an embodiment the request can be an HTTP request including one or more HTTP headers that define the operating parameters of the transaction. In various embodiments the network edge can be any resource center that may include data centers server farms CDN POPs or the like.

In operation the media content may be transferred from a cache server to a transcoding server at the POP. This may be performed in response to receiving the request for the media content or alternatively may be performed prior to receiving the request.

In operation the POP determines a device type associated with the requesting device based on the information contained in the request. For example the HTTP headers typically contain some information about the device type that has initiated the HTTP request. The POP e.g. transcoding server at the POP can inspect this information and determine the device type based on the HTTP headers. In accordance with an embodiment the device type can be associated with a particular encoding format that can be used to render the media content on that device. The transcoding system can include a number of profiles associated with various devices where the profiles indicate which encoding format is suitable for each device type or its operating system . The POP can utilize these profiles to determine which form of encoding to perform on the media content for the requesting device. In accordance with alternative embodiments the requesting device can indicate in the request which particular encoding format the device would like to receive the media content in.

In operation the transcoding server can transcode the media content cached at the POP in response to the request. In accordance with an embodiment the server can transcode the media content from one encoding format to another while simultaneously streaming the encoded bits to the device. In this manner the transcoding can be performed on the fly eliminating the need to pre transcode each media file into all the formats that are desired to be supported and thereby reducing the storage footprint and increasing the number of devices supported by the transcoding service.

In step the network edge server determines whether the cached copy of the media content is in the appropriate format for the device type. If the media content is already in the correct format the edge server can simply transmit the media content to the device to satisfy the request as shown in step . If on the other hand the media content is not in an encoding that is suitable for the requesting device the edge server can perform transcoding on the fly while simultaneously transmitting encoded bits to the device as shown in step . For example the edge server can perform MPEG2 to H.264 transcoding while at the same time streaming video content of the media file to the requesting device. It should be noted that in alternative embodiments the media content need not be transcoded while it is being streamed to the device but can instead be transcoded first and then provided to the device or delivered in segments that have been transcoded and the like.

Once the transcoding is complete the edge server can optionally cache the media content locally to satisfy any potential future requests as shown in step . In accordance with various embodiments the media content can be cached in the original encoding format the format into which it was just transcoded or in both encoding formats.
