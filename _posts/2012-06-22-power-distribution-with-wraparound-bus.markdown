title: Power distribution with wraparound bus
abstract: A power distribution system among a set of units (e.g., server blocks) may comprise, for each unit, a utility line and a unit generator, and a reserve generator providing failover transient performance and redundancy improvement to the power for the unit generators. The reserve generator may connect to the units via a reserve bus, and the unit generators may selectively connect to a wraparound bus connected to the reserve bus. When the failover load exceeds the available failover transient capability of one generator, one or more unit generators may (automatically or by operator selection) be connected with the wraparound bus to apply available transient capability to satisfy the excess failover load with minimal increase in power distribution resources and complexity.

In the field of computing many scenarios involve a distribution of power from a generator set to a set of units such as a set of computer workstations or servers. In many such scenarios the power distribution system may include one or more batteries that store energy during the ordinary provision of power from the utility line and then release the energy as power during a failure of the utility line. Additionally power may be provided to the units from a utility line but in the event of a failure of power supply via the utility line one or more generators may be utilized to convert a fuel supply into auxiliary power. These and other techniques may be utilized to provide power not only during periods of complete cessation of power from the utility line e.g. due to a physical severing of the utility line or a failure of a regional electric plant but also to supplement an inadequate provision of power from the utility line during a brownout and or to condition provided power during periods of inconsistency e.g. maintaining steady current and cycle in the event of fluctuations or surges in the power provided by the utility line .

In addition many such scenarios include failover mechanisms for redistributing power in the event of a failure of one or more components. For example in the event that a generator fails or is taken offline for maintenance a reserve generator may be utilized to provide power for one or more units if power supply from the utility line also fails. Such power redistribution may be achieved by a human operator who monitors the conditions of the generator set and selects generators to re route power in place of one or more failed generators. Alternatively the control mechanism for power redistribution may be automated e.g. by monitoring the conditions of each power supply and in the event of a failure of a generator may rapidly re route power through a reserve generator. These and other techniques may be used to achieve the distribution of power with failover capabilities to alleviate failures in the utility line and or components of the power distribution system.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

While the inclusion of reserve components within a power distribution system may provide failover capabilities for primary components it may be appreciated that such distribution may inadequately utilize existing power resources. For example a generator set may include one reserve generator but a failover event may cause reliance upon the reserve generator while it has been taken offline for maintenance the reserve generator may also fail during a failover event or the failover may involve more load than the reserve generator may provide. In these scenarios the power distribution system fails and causes at least some units to experience diminished power or loss of power. However other units may have unit generators that are operating below capacity or at zero capacity and that may otherwise bear the excess load that the reserve generator fails to handle but unless not tied into the reserve power distribution these unit generators may be inaccessible to apply the available capacity to the spare load. Many alternative techniques may address this inefficiency by providing additional failover units e.g. more than one reserve generator or complicated power re routing systems that may add significant cost and or complexity to the power distribution system.

Presented herein are techniques for achieving a distribution of power within a generator set in a manner that enables existing components to provide failover capacity. In such scenarios a reserve generator may be connected with the units through a reserve bus and respective units may include a reserve switch that taps into the power provided by the reserve generator when primary power sources for the unit e.g. the utility line the unit generator and or local batteries fail. In accordance with the techniques presented herein a wraparound bus may be connected with the reserve bus and selectively connected with respective unit generators. This power distribution architecture thus enables the application of available transient performance improvements needed to handle excess failover load with minimal additional cost and complexity.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a power distribution network configured to provide power to a set of units such as a set of server blocks in a large scale server facility. In these scenarios respective unit may be connected with a utility line that provides power from a utility source and one or more generators that in the event of a failure of the utility source e.g. a blackout a brownout or a power surge activate to generate power from a fuel supply. The units may also include a battery such as an uninterruptible power supply that provides power to the unit during transitions between power sources and or power conditioning resources that absorb power with fluctuating properties e.g. inconsistent current or availability and provide power with stable properties to more sensitive components within the unit e.g. computing resources that may fail if supplied with fluctuating power .

In such scenarios the distribution of power among the generators and the units may include failover capacity wherein in the event of a failure of power resources for a unit load from the unit may be transferred to reserve power sources. While many architectures may provide such failover capacity achieving such failover capabilities with rapidity reliability flexibility and cost efficiency may present a significant challenge in the architecture of power distribution systems.

However the architecture presented in the first exemplary scenario of also presents some deficiencies. As a first example a failover event of one or more units may arise while the reserve generator is offline e.g. during maintenance or testing . As a second example during a failover event the reserve generator may also fail e.g. experiencing an additional mechanical failure or a depletion of fuel . As a third example in the event of failover of multiple units in a large unit array the reserve load created by the unit loads demanding reserve power may exceed the available reserve capacity of the reserve generator . In these scenarios the reserve generator may be unable to supply adequate reserve power to the unit loads causing a loss of power or diminished power that may cause the unit loads to fail. Moreover in such scenarios this unit load failure may arise even if some unit generators have available capacity. For example a first unit may fail over to the reserve generator and the reserve generator may fail to provide adequate power but a second unit may comprise a unit generator having capacity exceeding the unit load of the second unit . The failure of power to the unit load of the first unit may have been alleviated by the spare capacity of the second unit generator but this may be unachievable in the power distribution architecture in this first exemplary scenario .

Alternative techniques may provide such alternative power distribution capabilities but with added expense complexity and or additional vulnerabilities. presents a second exemplary scenario wherein rather than coupling unit generators with respective units a set of generators may feed into a power distribution grid that distributes power to all of the units . While the decoupling of generators and units may alleviate some of the inefficiencies in the first exemplary scenario this architecture may present other inefficiencies. As a first example the comprehensive configuration of the power distribution grid may present significant complexity and costs. As a second example the power distribution grid may represent an additional point of failure and it may be difficult to service the power distribution grid without compromising the provision of power from the generators for all units . As a third example decoupling of the generators from the units may impose physical distance between the generators and the units thus increasing inefficient power transfer and reducing the modularity of the units . These and other inefficiencies may arise from power distribution architectures such as those presented in the exemplary scenarios of .

Presented herein are power distribution techniques that provide architectures featuring failover capacities that enable existing power resources to provide failover power capacity for other units in a flexible and controllable manner while reducing the added cost and complexity of the architecture. In such scenarios if the reserve generator may be connected with the units via a reserve bus the unit generators of respective units may be selectively connected to a wraparound bus that is connected to the reserve bus. Such selective coupling Improves the transient performance and redundancy of the generator system such that if the reserve UPS is offline the load can be powered directly from generators.

The techniques presented herein may be implemented in various types of embodiments. The exemplary scenario of presents a first such embodiment wherein power is provided to at least two units by a generator set comprising a reserve generator a reserve bus connecting respective units to the reserve generator for respective units a utility line a unit generator a generator switch configured to route power from the utility line and or the unit generator and a reserve switch configured to route power from the generator switch and or the reserve bus and a wraparound bus selectively connecting respective unit generators to the reserve bus .

Another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable storage device e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner that when executed on a processor of a device cause the device to perform the techniques presented herein. For example the processor executable instructions may be configured to cause the device to perform a method of presenting search results in response to a search query such as the exemplary method of . Many such computer readable storage devices may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and or the exemplary computer readable storage device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

As a first variation of the techniques presented herein the components within the units may be designed in view of the reserve bus and or wraparound bus . As a first such example respective unit generators may be selected for the power distribution architecture that are capable of providing power to the wraparound bus with a step load of at least one additional unit e.g. each unit generator may be selected to provide sufficient capacity for both the unit load of the unit and the unit load of a second unit that may fail over to the reserve bus thus providing a one to one correspondence between failing units and unit generators connecting to the wraparound bus . As a second example respective units may comprise a battery e.g. an uninterruptible power supply connecting the generator switch and the reserve switch . As a first such example the reserve switch may be configured to connect the unit to the reserve bus only after the battery is exhausted. As a second such example the battery may also replenish from the reserve bus . As a third such example the battery may also stabilize fluctuations in the reserve bus to provide stable power to the unit load . As a third such example respective units may comprise one or more air handling units e.g. airflow temperature and or humidity regulators that adjust air flow within the unit to provide climate regulation. Where respective units comprising a battery receiving power from the generator switch the units may comprise a primary air handling unit that is connected to the battery and or reserve switch and an auxiliary air handling unit that is connected to the generator switch but not connected to the battery and or reserve switch . This configuration may enable some air handling units to continue providing minimal air flow regulation in the event of a failure of the utility line unit generator and or generator switch while other air handling units are automatically shut down to conserve power drain during the failure.

As a second variation of the techniques presented herein where respective unit generators are connected with the wraparound bus via a wraparound switch a wraparound controller may be provided and configured to activate the wraparound switch for at least one unit generator to supplement the power on the reserve bus . As a first example the wraparound controller may comprise an operator panel featuring at least one operator switch that when toggled by an operator activates the wraparound switch for at least one unit generator . An operator may therefore monitor the reserve UPS and upon failure choose to utilize the wraparound bus to supply additional transient performance and redundancy to the reserve bus . As a second example the wraparound controller may comprise at least one reserve bus monitor that is configured to detect a reserve UPS failure on the reserve bus that results in no UPS protection from the reserve generator and an automated wraparound controller that is configured to upon the reserve bus monitor detecting the reserve insufficiency activate the wraparound switch for at least one unit generator . The automated wraparound controller may therefore provide automated failover utilizing the spare capacities of the unit generators according to a fixed or programmable logic. This logic may utilize various considerations while enabling such failover activation of the wraparound bus e.g. if respective unit generators have a maximum load an automated wraparound controller may be configured to activate the wraparound switches for respective unit generators within the maximum loads of the unit generators for the reserve bus .

As a third variation of the techniques presented herein the generator set may include a load bank that supplies an additional variable load on the reserve bus and or the wraparound bus e.g. a set of resistors that may be selectively activated to achieve a desired additional load on the power distribution . The inclusion of a load bank may be advantageous for various reasons. As a first example respective unit generators may have a minimum load below which undesired effects may arise. For example an underutilized unit generator may fail to consume all provided liquid fuel and unused liquid fuel may be emitted as part of the exhaust creating an undesirable wet stack effect presenting exhaust contamination and or resource corrosion. Adjusting the variable load of the load bank to meet the minimum load of the unit generator may enable the complete consumption of fuel and the avoidance of wet stacking. As a second example where the generator set is designed to provide fault tolerance for a specified number of unit failures of unit generators e.g. fault tolerance for the failover of three units the variable load of the load bank may be adjusted to apply a load on the reserve bus equivalent to that of the maximum failover units . Such added load may be advantageous e.g. for simulating the maximum failover load for testing. Alternatively by adjusting the load bank to a variable load not greater than the loads of the specified number of current unit failures e.g. reducing the variable load as units failover to the reserve bus and or upon detecting a connection of at least one unit generator to the wraparound bus the variable load of the load bank may maintain a consistent load on the reserve bus .

The following narrative presents an exemplary scenario featuring an embodiment of these techniques that combines several of the variations presented herein and will be described in the context of a hypothetical scenario featuring four units of the type illustrated in the exemplary scenario of .

The operation of the power distribution system may begin with all four units operating from the utility line . Accordingly the generator switches may select the utility line for the unit loads the unit generators may be deactivated to conserve fuel or may be operating in a low powered mode for faster availability the batteries may be charging or fully charged from the utility line and the reserve switches and wraparound switches may be opened. The reserve generator may also be deactivated may be operating in a low power mode or for rapid availability may be operating in a full power mode with the variable load of the load bank adjusted to satisfy a minimum load of the reserve generator e.g. to reduce wet stacking .

A failure of the utility line may cause in each unit an automated transition of the generator switch and an activation of the unit generator . The batteries in each unit may power the unit load during a brief startup activation of the unit generator . Each unit may therefore automatically switch to single generator mode and the reserve generator may remain unutilized by either unit .

If the unit generator for the first unit also fails the first unit may begin operating from the battery including a primary air handler connected to the battery but not including an auxiliary air handler connected to the generator switch . If the battery is inoperative or is depleted the reserve switch may activate to transfer the load of the first unit to the reserve generator via the reserve bus . This transfer may fully utilize the capacity of the reserve generator to maintain power to the first unit .

In the event of a similar failure of a unit generator and depletion of the battery for a second unit the reserve switch for the second unit may also transfer its load to the reserve bus . In architectures that fail to implement the techniques presented herein the concurrent transfer of the unit loads of the first two units may exceed the transient performance capability of the reserve generator causing inadequate or fluctuating reserve power to each unit or a complete failure of the reserve generator . Alternatively in the event of the failure of the first unit generator while the reserve generator is offline e.g. during maintenance or testing reserve power may be unavailable even for continued operation of just the first unit .

However in architectures utilizing the techniques presented herein an operator may activate the wraparound switches for either or both of the third and fourth units . This activation enables the third and or fourth unit generators to provide power through the wraparound bus to the reserve bus e.g. parallel generator operation mode thus supplementing the inadequate capacity of the reserve generator and or providing reserve power despite the absence of the reserve generator .

The application of these techniques in this scenario thus provides several advantages. As a first example the availability of the wraparound bus enables the supplementing of the transient performance and redundancy of the reserve generator to handle unit loads transferred from other units . As a second example the wraparound bus may enable compensation for unavailability of the reserve generator and or batteries in uninterruptible power supplies during a failover. As a third example this supplementing and compensating is achieved using existing resources e.g. unit generators having available capacity rather than acquiring and maintaining additional reserve generators . Moreover supplementing the reserve transient performance and redundancy through parallel generator operation may present greater capabilities for maintaining the voltage and frequency power quality to provide computer grade power than the reserve generator operating alone. As a fourth example reliance on the reserve capacity provided by unit generators via the wraparound bus may be reserved for failovers of primary unit resources e.g. the unit generator and battery for a unit thus conserving fuel and operating expenses. These and other advantages are achievable in this exemplary scenario utilizing the techniques presented herein.
