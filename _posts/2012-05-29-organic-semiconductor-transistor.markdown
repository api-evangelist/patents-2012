Thin film transistors are widely used as switching elements for display such as liquid crystal display elements. Thin film transistors have been traditionally produced by using amorphous or polycrystalline silicon.

Meanwhile in recent years studies on organic semiconductors that are represented by organic electroluminescence EL elements and the like have been actively conducted. Along with the studies there have been reports on the research to incorporate organic substances into circuits instead of silicon materials by taking advantage of characteristics such as light weight and flexibility.

According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an organic semiconductor transistor including 

an organic semiconductor layer containing at least one fluorene compound represented by the following formula I 

Hereinafter the exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. Furthermore the present invention is not intended to be limited by any action or function speculated in the present specification.

The organic semiconductor transistor of the present exemplary embodiment includes plural electrodes and an organic semiconductor layer containing at least one fluorene compound represented by the following formula I .

In an organic semiconductor transistor including an organic semiconductor layer using a fluorene compound represented by the formula I a decrease in the charge mobility is suppressed and size enlargement is realized as compared with organic semiconductor transistors including organic semiconductor layers that use poly 3 hexylthiophene .

First since the fluorene compound represented by the formula I has an alkyl group or an alkoxy group as Rand Rthat may be considered to impart solubility at both ends of an asymmetric skeleton in which a thiophene ring is linked to only one end of the fluorene skeleton it is believed that the hindrance caused by the alkyl group or alkoxy group which causes a decrease in charge mobility is suppressed.

Accordingly the fluorene compound may be considered to have excellent solubility in organic solvents that are generally used in the manufacture of electronic devices while suppressing the decrease in the charge mobility caused by an alkyl group or an alkoxy group.

That is it is thought that the compound represented by the formula I is a compound which achieves a good balance between the suppression of a decrease in charge mobility and excellent solubility.

Meanwhile in the present specification the term thiophene ring means a thiophene ring group or plural thiophene rings linked to each other.

In an organic semiconductor layer using the fluorene compound represented by the formula I since the fluorene compound represented by the formula I has excellent solubility as described in the above the organic semiconductor layer may be realized by a wet system so called wet process using a solution prepared by dissolving the compound in an organic solvent.

It is contemplated that in the organic semiconductor layer thus obtained since the solubility of the fluorene compound represented by the formula I in organic solvents is high even if the organic semiconductor layer is subjected to size enlargement defects in film formation such as cracks fissures and chips are suppressed.

As discussed above in the organic semiconductor transistor according to the exemplary embodiment size enlargement is realized while a decrease in charge mobility is suppressed.

Furthermore in the organic semiconductor transistor according to the exemplary embodiment since the fluorene compound represented by the formula I has excellent film forming properties and thus the formation of an organic semiconductor layer is realized by a wet process the formation of an organic semiconductor layer on a flexible substrate is also realized and as a result the provision of a flexible organic semiconductor transistor is also realized.

Hereinafter the fluorene compound represented by the following formula I will be described in detail and then the organic semiconductor transistor of the exemplary embodiment will be described.
