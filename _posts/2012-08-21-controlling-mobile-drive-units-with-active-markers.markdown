Inventory systems such as those in e commerce warehouses distribution centers manufacturing facilities and the like may be used to fulfill orders for various inventory items. As inventory systems grow in size such inventory systems face an increasingly complex problem of meeting demand for fulfillment of multiple orders at or near the same time. The increasing complexity of fulfilling such orders may contribute to decreasing efficiency and increasing costs.

Inventory systems are utilized by many entities for storing and managing inventory. For example some retailers may utilize a warehouse of racks that store inventory items in various bins. When an order for a specific inventory item needs to be filled by the retailer a worker typically retrieves the inventory item from the bin where the inventory item is stored.

Inventory systems of the present disclosure may utilize one or more mobile drive units to automatically retrieve inventory holders from warehouse storage. In some embodiments mobile drive units may be self powered robotic devices configured to move freely about the warehouse. Inventory holders may store inventory items. Inventory holders may be transported by mobile drive units to an inventory station. The inventory station may include a human operator and or automated equipment to remove desired inventory items from the inventory holders and complete orders. The ability for mobile drive units to transport inventory items to an inventory station rather than or in addition to workers manually retrieving inventory items from stationary racks may vastly increase efficiency and productivity of the inventory system. For example by utilizing mobile drive units an inventory system may be capable of fulfilling more orders per hour than previous solutions.

Mobile drive units may move about the warehouse and or retrieve inventory holders in response to commands and or instructions received from an automated guidance system. For example a management module may control administration of certain elements and or tasks within the warehouse system. The management module may transmit information to control movement of mobile drive units such as task assignments. Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a system and method for controlling a mobile drive unit with active markers. Active markers may communicate commands and or instructions to mobile drive units from a management module. Active markers may additionally or alternatively communicate commands and or instructions to mobile drive units from other mobile drive units. Thus active markers may form all or a part of an automated guidance system used to control mobile drive units.

Active markers may be arranged in any suitable pattern within the workspace and may be configured to communicate with mobile drive units when in suitably close proximity to a given mobile drive unit. In some embodiments active markers may communicate using one or more light emitting diodes LEDs . Active markers may emit a signal from the LEDs that the mobile drive unit recognizes as a command and or instruction. Active markers may aid in determining the location of a mobile drive unit within the warehouse. A mobile drive unit may detect an active marker when the mobile drive unit is in proximity to the active marker. For example the mobile drive unit may detect an active marker disposed on or near the floor of a warehouse using a camera or photo detector mounted beneath the mobile drive unit. As another example the mobile drive unit may detect an active marker disposed on or near the ceiling of a warehouse using an appropriately located camera or photo detector. The mobile drive unit and or management module may store a virtual map of active markers within its control system. Detecting the active marker may thus allow the mobile drive unit and or a management module to maintain an accurate indication of the location of the mobile drive unit within the warehouse. Additionally the active marker may be configured to communicate information to the mobile drive unit. The information may provide instructions and or commands to the mobile drive unit such as to proceed to a second location to lift an inventory holder and or to complete any suitable task the mobile drive unit is capable of performing. Thus the disclosed embodiments may be capable of controlling mobile drive units with active markers.

The ability for mobile drive units to be controlled by active markers may result in one or more technical advantages. For example the ability to control mobile drive units with active markers may result in certain operational efficiencies such as reducing the operational load on a management module responsible for coordinating and administrating tasks within the inventory system. For example in some embodiments a management module may communicate with mobile drive units using one or more wireless protocols. By utilizing active markers to control mobile drive units wireless bandwidth required by the automated guidance system may be reduced and or eliminated.

Mobile drive unit may analyze the communication of active marker to determine a location of mobile drive unit within workspace . Mobile drive unit may be able to determine its location in workspace based on the information received from active marker . For example mobile drive unit may determine the location of active marker within a virtual map of components in system stored by mobile drive unit . The virtual map may include the fixed location of active markers within workspace . In some embodiments mobile drive unit may transmit presence information to active marker . Presence information may include the identity of mobile drive unit . Active marker may determine the identity of mobile drive unit based on the presence information. Active marker may transmit the presence of mobile drive unit to other active markers within workspace . Active marker may additionally or alternatively communicate location updates of other mobile drive units inventory holders and or other appropriate components of system to mobile drive unit in proximity to the active marker . Thus active marker may be capable of providing mobile drive unit with the updated location status of the various components of system . Alternatively or in addition in some embodiments management module may store a virtual map of the components of system . Management module may determine the location of mobile drive unit within workspace based on presence information from mobile drive unit transmitted by active marker to management module . The presence information may indicate that a particular mobile drive unit is in proximity to a particular active marker .

Based on information received from active marker mobile drive unit may be capable of proceeding along a path to a destination. When at the end of a given segment active marker may communicate a portion of the path to mobile drive unit . Mobile drive unit may be capable of proceeding along a path by moving along segments from the center of one workspace cell to another workspace cell. Thus the mobile drive unit may move to the destination by traversing the path in a segment by segment manner. Active marker may instruct mobile drive unit to proceed to one of the workspace cells adjacent to the active marker . Thus mobile drive unit may in some embodiments proceed along a path without necessarily knowing the next segments in advance. However in other embodiments mobile drive unit may know and or calculate the path. The path planning component may in various embodiments be included within management module and or one or more particular mobile drive units . In some embodiments one or more mobile drive units may be designated to plan paths for other mobile drive units . The component responsible for path planning may utilize knowledge of current congestion historical traffic trends task prioritization and or other appropriate considerations to select an optimal path for mobile drive unit to take in getting to the destination. Additionally in planning the path or in assigning tasks the path planning component may make informed decisions regarding the use of lifts conveyors ramps tunnels and or other conveyance equipment or features of workspace to facilitate the movement of the relevant mobile drive unit .

As noted above mobile drive units may in some embodiments each plan their own paths to a given destination. Based on information received from active marker indicating the mobile drive unit s location and or location information of other components within workspace mobile drive unit may be capable of planning a path to a destination while avoiding various obstacles such as other mobile drive units . A given mobile drive unit may also receive path planning information from other mobile drive units to facilitate planning its own path. In some embodiments mobile drive unit may be capable of planning a path based on the information received by active marker . In some embodiments mobile drive units may request a reservation of a workspace cell before moving into the cell. For example mobile drive unit may make a reservation request by communicating with an active marker and or by communicating with management module . Mobile drive unit may proceed into the workspace cell if the request is granted and may not proceed into the workspace cell if the request is denied. In some embodiments mobile drive units may make reservation requests by communicating with active markers .

Mobile drive unit may also indicate that a given task is completed to active marker . For example if a previous task was to proceed to active marker mobile drive unit may indicate that the previous task is complete when the mobile drive unit reaches active marker . As another example task may be to lift or lower an inventory holder at active marker . After indicating a previous task s completion mobile drive unit may request a new task from active marker . Additionally or alternatively mobile drive unit may communicate the status of task directly with management module and or a mobile drive unit designated to control other mobile drive units .

Components of inventory system such as active markers and or mobile drive units may provide information to management module regarding the current state and or condition of inventory system including the status of mobile drive units inventory holders and or other components of inventory system . This may allow management module to utilize feedback from the relevant components to update algorithm parameters adjust policies or otherwise modify its decision making to respond to changes in operating conditions or the occurrence of particular events. Thus according to these teachings management module may generate tasks allot usage of system resources and direct the completion of tasks by components of system using one or more active markers . The use of active markers in communication with mobile drive units may reduce and or eliminate the operational load of management module for example by offloading path planning and or reservation activities from management module .

The second location could for example by a location at which an inventory holder is stored within workspace . The information may represent an instruction to move to the second location. In response to receiving the instruction to complete a given task mobile drive unit may perform any number and combination of maneuvers in order to complete task . In addition or in the alternative to moving to a second location the information may represent an instruction to complete any number and or combinations of tasks within workspace . Mobile drive unit may complete various tasks based on the information received by active marker . For example mobile drive unit may lift an inventory holder and or complete a rotation maneuver. In some embodiments mobile drive unit may lift inventory holder at the second location. In some embodiments while moving to a location within workspace along a path such as to the second location mobile drive unit may detect obstacles in the path. For example another mobile drive unit human operator or other object may be blocking the mobile drive unit from proceeding along the path. Mobile drive unit may be capable of in response to detecting an obstacle calculate an alternate path around the obstacle. In some embodiments mobile drive unit may additionally or alternatively request a new path from management module . After receiving or calculating a new path mobile drive unit may proceed along the new path to avoid the obstacle.

After task received from the active marker is complete at step mobile drive unit may then indicate its availability to complete another task to active marker . If management module has assigned another task to mobile drive unit management module may transmit instructions to the active marker at the second location such as a storage location. For example an additional instruction may be to transport the inventory holder in storage to an inventory station. At the inventory station inventory items may be removed from the inventory holder and used to fill an order . After the tasks associated with inventory station are complete mobile drive unit may receive an instruction from an active marker at the inventory station to proceed to another location. For example mobile drive unit may transport an inventory holder storing a completed order to a shipping dock and or storage area for completed orders in preparation for shipping. Mobile drive unit may be instructed by active marker to undock with inventory holder at any appropriate location such as at the shipping dock or other storage area within workspace . Mobile drive unit may additionally or alternatively proceed to the location of another active marker that may be designated as a waiting location for mobile drive unit while waiting to receive another task . Thus when management module is ready to assign another task to mobile drive unit task may be transmitted to the active marker associated with the waiting location of mobile drive unit and the method may repeat.
