The invention relates generally to network printing e.g. cloud printing and more specifically relates to systems methods and computer readable media for improved network printing using a printing system e.g. a multi function printer scanner copier device etc. by enabling the user to select options for example payment options.

 Cloud computing generally encompasses processing and or storage of data based on the Internet or based on an enterprise intra net. For example cloud computing may encompass the concepts of Software as a Service SaaS cloud storage and cloud printing. SaaS provides an application as a service for a customer to use on demand. Cloud storage generally encompasses the concept of providing delivering data storage as a service with the customer being billed for storage usage under a utility computing model similar to traditional public utilities including electricity . Cloud printing generally encompasses a client process accessing a document from a cloud storage server and causing the document to print. As with cloud storage a cloud printing user could be charged for the number of pages processed and or printed. Often the client process in such cloud printing is the printing system itself on which a user interface allows a user to select a document to be retrieved and printed.
