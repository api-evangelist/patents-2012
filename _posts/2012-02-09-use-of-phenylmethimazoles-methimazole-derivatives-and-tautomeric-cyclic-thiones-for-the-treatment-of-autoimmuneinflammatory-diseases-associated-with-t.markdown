Autoimmune diseases are currently clinically defined by i humoral or autoantibody response to a self antigen e.g. Graves primary hyperthyroidism with antibodies to the TSH receptor or ii cellular response wherein immune cells destroy nonimmune cells from which the self antigen is derived e.g. the thyrocyte Hashimoto s thyroiditis or pancreatic islet cell Type 1 diabetes I. Roitt 7th ed. 312 346 1991 . Many autoimmune diseases are in fact a combination of both phenomena I. Roitt Essential Immunology 7th ed. 312 346 1991 thus Hashimoto s and Type 1 diabetes also have auto antibodies anti thyroid peroxidase TPO or anti glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD Islet Cell. Additionally autoimmune diseases often have a significant inflammatory component including increases in adhesion molecules e.g. vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 VCAM 1 and altered leukocyte adhesion to the vasculature e.g. colitis systemic lupus systemic sclerosis and the vascular complications of diabetes I. Roitt 7th ed. 312 346 1991 S. A. Jimenez et al. 140 37 50 2004 .

Recent studies demonstrate a formidable link between the Toll like receptor TLR signaling pathway of innate immunity and the slower more deliberate adaptive immune system that characterizes humoral and cellular autoimmunity K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 K. Takeda et al. 21 335 76 2003 K. Takeda et al. 5 143 53 2003 R. J. Ulevitch 187 Suppl 2 S351 5 2003 L. Steinman 305 212 6 2004 L. D. Kohn et al. In press 2005 N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 H. Oshiumi et al. 4 161 7 2003 M. Yamamoto et al. 169 6668 72 2002 M. Miettinen et al. 2 349 55 2001 L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 C. Fiocchi 115 182 205 1998 E. Cario et al. 68 7010 7 2000 . Innate immunity is a protective immune cell response that functions rapidly to fight environmental insults including but not limited to bacterial or viral agents. Adaptive immunity is a slower response which involves differentiation and activation of naive T lymphocytes into T helper 1 Th1 or T helper 2 Th2 cell types I. Roitt 7th ed. 312 346 1991 . Th1 cells mainly promote cellular immunity whereas Th2 cells mainly promote humoral immunity. Though primarily a host protective system pathologic expression of the innate immunity signals emanating from the TLR pathway are now implicated in initiating autoimmune inflammatory diseases.

Therapies for autoimmune inflammatory endocrine or non endocrine diseases are largely aimed at treating the symptoms of the disease. For the most part the underlying genetic susceptibilities are poorly defined are multiple are often not disease specific and are largely not readily amenable to therapy. Immunosuppressive agents that are used to treat autoimmune inflammatory diseases largely target the immune cell response or the cytokines they produce. They are only partially effective in inducing remission methimazole in Graves toxic cyclosporin for Type 1 diabetes or simply palliative anti inflammatory corticosteroids for colitis or systemic lupus . The involvement of TLR in autoimmune inflammatory diseases raises the possibility that diagnosis and treatment must undergo a re alignment K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 L. D. Kohn et al. In press 2005 N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 H. Oshiumi et al. 4 161 7 2003 M. Yamamoto et al. 169 6668 72 2002 M. Miettinen et al. 2 349 55 2001 L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 C. Fiocchi 115 182 205 1998 E. Cario et al. 68 7010 7 2000 .

Thus despite our knowledge that many autoimmune inflammatory diseases were induced or worsened by an environmental agent e.g. smoking or viral infections little was known of the details by which this induction signal process worked nor was there a therapy to block this induction signal process I. Roitt 7th ed. 312 346 1991 J. George et al. 45 1 6 1997 C. Nagata et al. 34 333 7 1995 .

Thus the recent description of TLR and the TLR signal mechanism of innate immunity upon which adaptive humoral or cell mediated immunity depends has created an opportunity to develop of a new class of drugs as well as new diagnostic paradigms L. D. Kohn et al. In press 2005 N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 801 986 2004 L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 912 948 2004 .

By attacking the innate immune induction event of autoimmune inflammatory disease early identification of the induction signal event or environmental insult in a person at risk and initiation of therapy post induction or during the latency period of disease onset could allow therapy to be more effective prevent or retard cell destruction avoid long term inflammatory complications enhance quality of life and decrease associated medical costs. Since there is increasing evidence that the atherosclerotic process and cardiovascular disease i.e. the vascular complications of type 2 and type 1 diabetes exhibit similar mechanisms involving TLR and a pathologic innate immune response they too can benefit from the same treatment paradigm despite being currently considered late stage phenomena K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 H. M. Dansky et al. 21 1662 7 2001 P. E. Szmitko et al. 108 2041 8 2003 P. E. Szmitko et al. 108 1917 23 2003 M. I. Cybulsky et al. 20 Suppl B 24B 8B 2004 P. M. Ridker et al. 109 IV6 19 2004 . No such method exists although it is considered important.

At the end of the 20th century Toll like receptors TLRs were shown to be essential to induce expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses. Since their description there has been rapid progress in our understanding that TLRs and the innate immune system is a critical step in the development of antigen specific acquired immunity. This is recently reviewed by several groups K. Takeda et al. 17 1 14 2005 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 the material following is largely derived from one K. Takeda et al. 17 1 14 2005 but is common to all B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 and represents only the current thoughts in a rapidly developing area.

The TLR Family. Mammalian TLRs comprise a large family consisting of at least 10 functional members such as TLR1 9 which are conserved between the human and mouse. The cytoplasmic portion of TLRs shows high similarity to that of the IL 1 receptor family and is termed a Toll IL 1 receptor TIR domain. Despite this similarity the extracellular portions of TLR are structurally unrelated. The IL 1 receptors possess an immunoglobulin like domain whereas TLRs bear leucine rich repeats LRRs in the extracellular domain. TLRs play important roles in recognizing specific signature molecules derived from pathogens including bacteria fungi protozoa and viruses derived from their invasion of cells or resultant from the effects of noxious environmental stimuli which cause cell damage.

Toll like Receptors 1 2 and 6 TLR1 TLR2 and TLR6 . TLR2 recognizes a variety of lipoproteins lipopeptides from various pathogens e.g. Gram positive bacteria mycobacteria fungi and K. Takeda et al. 21 335 76 2003 . In addition TLR2 reportedly recognizes LPS preparations from non enterobacteria such as and . These LPS structurally differ from the typical LPS of Gram negative bacteria recognized by TLR4 in the number of acyl chains in the lipid A component which presumably confers differential recognition thus LPS from only poorly activates TLR4 M. Hashimoto et al. 16 1431 7 2004 .

There are two proposed explanations that could explain why TLR2 recognizes a wide spectrum of microbial components. The first is that TLR2 forms heterophilic dimers with other TLRs such as TLR1 and TLR6 both of which are structurally related to TLR2. The second involves interactions B. N. Gantner et al. 197 1107 17 2003 with distinct types of receptors such as dectin 1 a lectin family receptor for the fungal cell wall component beta glucan. Thus TLR2 recognizes a wide range of microbial products through functional cooperation with several proteins that are either structurally related or unrelated to TLR.

Toll like receptor 3 TLR3 . Expression of human TLR3 in non responsive cells confers enhanced activation of NF B in response to dsRNA. In addition TLR3 deficient mice are impaired in their response to dsRNA L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 which is produced by most viruses during their replication and which induces the synthesis of type I interferons IFN . Type I IFNs induce anti viral and immunostimulatory activities in the cells. Thus TLR3 is implicated in the recognition of dsRNA and viruses and the antiviral gene response thereto.

Toll like Receptor 4 TLR4 . TLR4 is an essential receptor for LPS recognition A. Poltorak et al. 282 2085 8 1998 K. Hoshino et al. 162 3749 52 1999 . In addition TLR4 is implicated in the recognition of endogenous ligands such as heat shock proteins HSP60 and HSP70 domain A of fibronectins as well as oligosaccharides of hyaluronic acid heparan sulfate and fibrinogen. However since these endogenous ligands require very high concentrations to activate TLR4 contamination by LPS is suspected.

Toll like Receptor 5 TLR5 . Expression of human TLR5 in CHO cells confers response to flagellin a monomeric constituent of bacterial flagella F. Hayashi et al. 410 1099 103 2001 . TLR5 is expressed on the basolateral side of intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal endothelial cells of the subepithelial compartment. Further flagellin activates lung epithelial cells to induce inflammatory cytokine production and a stop codon polymorphism in TLR5 has been associated with susceptibility to pneumonia caused by the flagellated bacterium . These findings indicate the important role of TLR5 in microbial recognition at the mucosal surface of mammalian cells.

Toll like Receptors 7 and 8 TLR7 and TLR8 . TLR7 and TLR8 are structurally highly conserved proteins which recognize guanosine or uridine rich single stranded RNA ssRNA from viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus F. Heil et al. 303 1526 9 2004 S. S. Diebold et al. 303 1529 31 2004 J. M. Lund et al. 101 5598 603 2004 . ssRNA is abundant in the host but usually the host derived ssRNA is not detected by TLR7 or TLR8. This might be due to the fact that TLR7 and TLR8 are expressed in the endosome and host derived ssRNA is not delivered to the endosome see below .

Toll like Receptor 9 TLR9 . TLR9 is a receptor for CpG DNA H. Hemmi et al. 408 740 5 2000 . Bacterial and viral DNA contains unmethylated CpG motifs which confer its immunostimulatory activity. In vertebrates the frequency of CpG motifs is severely reduced and the cytosine residues of CpG motifs are highly methylated leading to abrogation of the immunostimulatory activity. Structurally there are at least two types of CpG DNA B K type CpG DNA is a potent inducer of inflammatory cytokines such as IL 12 and TNF A D type CpG DNA has a greater ability to induce IFN production from plasmacytoid dendritic cells PDC In addition to recognizing bacterial and viral CpG DNA TLR9 is involved in pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Thus it may be important in Graves autoimmune hyperthyroidism and mediates production of rheumatoid factor by auto reactive B cells G. A. Viglianti et al. 19 837 47 2003 . Similarly internalization by the Fc receptor can cause TLR9 mediated PDC induction of IFN by immune complexes containing IgG and chromatin which are implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE M. W. Boule et al. 199 1631 40 2004 . Thus TLR9 appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases through recognition of the chromatin structure. Chloroquine which is clinically used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and SLE is currently presumed to block TLR9 dependent signaling through inhibition of the pH dependent maturation of endosomes by neutralizing acidification in the vesicle H. Hacker et al. 17 6230 40 1998 .

Toll like Receptor 11 TLR11 . The most recently identified TLR11 has been shown to be expressed in bladder epithelial cells and mediate resistance to infection by uropathogenic bacteria in mouse D. Zhang et al. 303 1522 6 2004 .

Subcellular Localization of Some TLRs. Individual TLRs are differentially distributed within the cell. TLR1 TLR2 TLR3 and TLR4 are expressed on the cell surface in contrast TLR3 TLR7 TLR8 and TLR9 have been shown to be expressed in intracellular compartments such as endosomes. TLR3 TLR7 or TLR9 mediated recognition of their ligands has been shown to require endosomal maturation and processing. Thus for example TLR9 is recruited from the endoplasmic reticulum upon non specific uptake of CpG DNA H. Hacker et al. 17 6230 40 1998 E. Latz et al. 5 190 8 2004 C. A. Leifer et al. 173 1179 83 2004 . When either nonimmune cells that become antigen presenting cells macrophages monocytes or dendritic cells engulf bacteria by phagocytosis they degrade the bacteria and release CpG DNA in phagosomes lysosomes or in endosomes lysosomes where they can interact TLR9.

Similarly as another example when viruses invade cells by receptor mediated endocytosis the viral contents are exposed to the cytoplasm by fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane. This results in exposure of TLR ligands such as dsRNA ssRNA and CpG DNA to TLR9 in the phagosomal lysosomal or endosomal lysosomal compartments.

TLR independent Recognition of Micro organisms dsRNA Transfection De Novo or RNA DNA Introduction By viruses Can Nevertheless Activate TLR Signaling Pathways. Although TLR3 is involved in the recognition of viral derived dsRNA the impairment observed in TLR3 deficient mice is only partial L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 M. Yamamoto et al. 301 640 3 2003 . Thus introduction of dsRNA into the cytoplasm of dendritic cells leads to the induction of type I IFNs independent of TLR3 S. S. Diebold et al. 424 324 8 2003 . Although PKR is implicated in dsRNA recognition it is still controversial if it plays a critical role in dsRNA induced type I IFN expression E. J. Smith et al. 276 8951 7 2001 .

Recently one key molecule that mediates TLR3 independent dsRNA recognition was shown to be Retinoic acid inducible gene I RIG I . RIG 1 encodes a DExD H box RNA helicase containing a caspase recruitment domain that augments dsRNA dependent activation of the IRF 3 dependent promoter.

The nucleotide binding oligomerization domain NOD family of proteins also plays an important role in the TLR independent recognition of intracellular bacteria.

NOD1 contains a caspase recruitment domain CARD a NOD domain and a C terminal LRR domain. Overexpression of NOD1 enables cells to respond to peptidoglycans PGN which are recognized by TLR2 O. Takeuchi et al. 11 443 51 1999 c D glutamyl meso diaminopimelic acid iE DAP is the minimal PGN structure required. NOD2 shows structural similarity to NOD1 but possesses two CARD domains and the essential structure recognized by NOD2 is a muramyl dipeptide MurNAc L Ala D isoGln MDP derived from PGN. MDP is found in almost all bacteria whereas iE DAP is restricted to Gram negative bacteria.

Mutations in the NOD2 gene have been shown to be associated with Crohn s disease Y. Ogura et al. 411 603 6 2001 J. P. Hugot et al. 411 599 603 2001 result in enhanced NF B activation and may contribute to enhanced NF B activity and Th1 responses in Crohn s disease patients T. Watanabe et al. 5 800 8 2004 . NOD2 mutations also lead to an increase in NF B activity and are associated with Blau syndrome a disease characterized by granulomatous arthritis uveitis and skin rash C. Miceli Richard et al. 29 19 20 2001 .

Rip2 RICK a serine threonine kinase has a CARD domain in its C terminal portion and an N terminal catalytic domain that shares sequence similarity with Rip a factor essential for NF B activation through the TNF receptor. NODs and Rip2 RICK interact via their respective CARD domains and induce recruitment of the IKK complex to the central region of Rip2 RICK. This in turn leads to activation of NF B.

TLR Signaling Pathways MyD88 Pathway and NF B MAP Kinase Signals. In the signaling pathways downstream of the TIR domain a TIR domain containing adaptor MyD88 was the first shown to be essential for induction of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL 12 through all TLRs F. Hayashi et al. 410 1099 103 2001 H. Hemmi et al. 3 196 200 2002 O. Takeuchi et al. 12 113 7 2000 T. Kawai et al. 11 115 22 1999 M. Schnare et al. 10 1139 42 2000 H. Hacker et al. 192 595 600 2000 . However activation of specific TLRs led to slightly different patterns of gene expression profiles. For example activation of TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways resulted in induction of type I interferons IFNs but activation of TLR2 and TLR5 mediated pathways did not V. Toshchakov et al. 9 169 75 2003 K. Hoshino et al. 14 1225 31 2002 S. Doyle et al. 17 251 63 2002 . TLR7 TLR8 and TLR9 signaling pathways also lead to induction of Type I IFNs through mechanisms distinct from TLR3 4 mediated induction H. Hemmi et al. 170 3059 64 2003 T. Ito et al. 195 1507 12 2002 . Thus individual TLR signaling pathways are divergent although MyD88 is common to all TLRs. It has thus become clear that there are MyD88 dependent and MyD88 independent pathways.

The MyD88 dependent pathway is analogous to signaling by the IL 1 receptors. As currently perceived MyD88 harboring a C terminal TIR domain and an N terminal death domain associates with the TIR domain of TLRs. Upon stimulation MyD88 recruits IRAK 4 to TLRs through interaction of the death domains of both molecules and facilitates IRAK 4 mediated phosphorylation of IRAK 1. Activated IRAK 1 then associates with TRAF6 leading to the activation of two distinct signaling pathways. One pathway leads to activation of AP 1 transcription factors through activation of MAP kinases. Another pathway activates the TAK1 TAB complex which enhances activity of the I B kinase IKK complex. Once activated the IKK complex induces phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I B which leads to nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF B. The MyD88 dependent pathway plays a crucial role and is essential for inflammatory cytokine production through all TLRs. Thus MyD88 deficient mice do not show production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL 12p40 in response to all TLR ligands F. Hayashi et al. 410 1099 103 2001 H. Hemmi et al. 3 196 200 2002 O. Takeuchi et al. 12 113 7 2000 T. Kawai et al. 11 115 22 1999 M. Schnare et al. 10 1139 42 2000 H. Hacker et al. 192 595 600 2000 .

A MyD88 related TIR domain containing molecule TIRAP TIR domain containing adaptor protein Mal MyD88 adaptor like T. Horng et al. 2 835 41 2001 K. A. Fitzgerald et al. 413 78 83 2001 has been shown to be essential for the MyD88 dependent signaling pathway via TLR2 and TLR4. Thus TIRAP Mal deficient macrophages show impaired inflammatory cytokine production in response to TLR4 and TLR2 ligands T. Horng et al. 420 329 33 2002 M. Yamamoto et al. 420 324 9 2002 but are not impaired in their response to TLR3 TLR5 TLR7 and TLR9 ligands.

MyD88 independent TRIF dependent Pathway and IRF 3 Type 1 IFN Signaling. TLR4 ligand induced production of inflammatory cytokines is not observed in MyD88 deficient macrophages however activation of NF B is observed with delayed kinetics T. Kawai et al. 167 5887 94 2001 . Thus a MyD88 independent component exists.

In TLR3 and TLR4 mediated signaling pathways activation of IRF 3 and induction of IFN are observed in a MyD88 independent manner. The TIR domain containing adaptor TRIF is essential for the MyD88 independent pathway however in the case of TLR4 but not TLR3 the TIR domain containing adaptor TRAM is also involved in the TRIF dependent activation of IRF 3 and induction of IFN and IFN inducible genes pathway as evidenced in TRAM deficient mice or by RNAi mediated knockdown K. A. Fitzgerald et al. 198 1043 55 2003 M. Yamamoto et al. 4 1144 50 2003 H. Oshiumi et al. 278 49751 62 2003 .

Non typical IKKs IKKi IKKe and TBK1 mediate activation of IRF 3 downstream of TRIF as well as the late phase of NF B activation in a MyD88 independent manner T. Kawai et al. 167 5887 94 2001 . Activation of IRF 3 leads to production of IFN . IFN in turn activates Stat1 and induces several IFN inducible genes V. Toshchakov et al. 9 169 75 2003 K. Hoshino et al. 14 1225 31 2002 S. Doyle et al. 17 251 63 2002 . The physiological role of TRIF was demonstrated by generation of TRIF deficient or TRIF mutant mice which showed no activation of IRF 3 and had impaired expression of IFN and IFN inducible genes in response to TLR3 and TLR4 ligands S. S. Diebold et al. 424 324 8 2003 .

In TRIF and TRAM deficient mice inflammatory cytokine production induced by TLR2 TLR7 and TLR9 ligands was observed as well as TLR4 ligand induced phosphorylation of IRAK 1 S. S. Diebold et al. 424 324 8 2003 M. Yamamoto et al. 4 1144 50 2003 . These findings indicate that the MyD88 dependent pathway is not impaired in these mice. However TLR4 ligand induced inflammatory cytokine production was also not observed in TRIF and TRAM deficient mice. Therefore activation of both the MyD88 dependent and MyD88 independent TRIF dependent components is believed to be required for the TLR3 4 induced inflammatory cytokine production.

Key molecules that mediate IRF 3 activation have been revealed to be non canonical IKKs TBK1 and IKKi IKKe. Thus introduction of TBK1 or IKKi IKKe but not IKKb resulted in phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF 3. Also RNAi mediated inhibition of TBK1 or IKKi IKKe expression led to impaired induction of IFN in response to viruses and dsRNA S. Sharma et al. 300 1148 51 2003 .

The Mechanisms of MyD88 independent TLR Signaling of Both IRF 3 and NF B Pathways by TLR3 The TIR domain of TRIF is located in the middle portion of this molecule flanked by the N terminal and C terminal portions. Both N terminal and C terminal portions of TRIF mediate activation of the NF B dependent promoter whereas only the N terminal portion is involved in IFN promoter activation M. Yamamoto et al. 169 6668 72 2002 . Accordingly the N terminal portion of TRIF was shown to associate with IKKi IKKe and TBK1 which mediate IRF 3 dependent IFN induction K. A. Fitzgerald et al. 4 491 6 2003 S. Sato et al. 171 4304 10 2003 . The N terminal portion of TRIF was also shown to associate with TRAF6 S. Sato et al. 171 4304 10 2003 Z. Jiang et al. 101 3533 8 2004 TRAF6 is critically involved in TLR mediated NF B activation J. Gohda et al. 173 2913 7 2004 The C terminal portion of TRIF was shown to associate with RIPI E. Meylan et al. 5 503 7 2004 thus RIPI was shown to be responsible for NF B activation that originates from the C terminal portion of TRIF.

Negative Regulation of TLR Signaling. Stimulation of TLRs by microbial components triggers the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF IL 6 and IL 12. When all these cytokines are produced in excess they induce serious systemic disorders with a high mortality rate in the host. It is therefore not surprising that organisms have evolved mechanisms for modulating their TLR mediated responses. TLR signaling pathways are negatively regulated by several molecules. IRAK M inhibits dissociation of IRAK 1 IRAK 4 complex from the receptor. MyD88s blocks association of IRAK 4 with MyD88. SOCS1 is likely to associate with IRAK 1 and inhibits its activity. TRIAD3A induces ubiquitination mediated degradation of TLR4 and TLR9. TIR domain containing receptors SIGIRR and T1 ST2 are also shown to negatively modulate TLR signaling. Thus several molecules are postulated to negatively modulate TLR signaling pathways and in combination may normally finely coordinate the TLR signaling pathway to limit exaggerated innate responses causing harmful disorders.

Exposure to microbial components such as LPS results in a severely reduced response to a subsequent challenge by LPS termed endotoxin or LPS tolerance. Several negative regulation mechanisms are also shown to be involved in LPS tolerance H. Fan et al. 10 71 84 2004 .

C. IRF 1 Signaling Induced by Overexpressed TLR3 or TLR4 Signaling is Critical in Autoimmune Inflammatory Disease

The regulatory effect of IRF 1 has been reported in several in vitro and in vivo models of autoimmune inflammatory diseases Arthritis A. Shiraishi et al. 159 3549 54 1997 T.

Bachmaier et al. 96 585 91 1997 .

IRF 1 can up regulate the inflammatory immune response at the innate and adaptive level by increasing the inflammatory gene expression in macrophages dendritic cells and CD 4 T cells. Thus upregulation of IRF 1 gene expression can increase the expression of inflammatory mediators such as arachidonic acid signaling COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes X. Teng et al. 282 C144 52 2002 chemokines M. S. Baker et al. 134 134 41 2003 Y. Ohmori et al. 69 598 604 2001 iNOS M. Delgado et al. 162 4685 96 1999 M. S. Baker et al. 134 134 41 2003 X.

Kirchhoff et al. 261 546 54 1999 as well as the pro inflammatory cytokines TNF IL1 IL 6 IL 12 and INF . IRF 1 gene overexpression may thus induce autoimmune inflammatory diseases by its effects on macrophages dendritic cells and CD4 Th1 cell lymphocytic cells.

Despite information implicating the importance of IRF 1 signaling in macrophages dendritic cells and CD4 Th1 cell lymphocytic cells comparable effects after TLR3 or TLR4 mediated increases of IRF 1 in nonimmune cells have been less clear. However studies of the effects of methimazole methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones particularly phenylmethimazole C10 related to Hashimoto s thyroiditis Colitis toxic shock and atherosclerosis summarized herein establish the importance of its overexpression in nonimmune cells associated with or caused by TLR3 or TLR4 signal overexpression.

Leukocyte adhesion is central to atherosclerosis an autoimmune inflammatory disease. One of the earliest steps in the development of atherosclerotic lesions is the adhesion of leukocytes monocytes and lymphocytes to the apical surface of the endothelium and subsequent migration across the endothelium into the subendothelial space at select anatomical sites in the arterial tree. This process occurs through a cascade of adhesive events. This adhesion cascade is mediated in part by binding of molecules present on the surface of the leukocyte e.g. integrins to adhesion molecules on the surface of the endothelium e.g VCAM 1 . Subsequent to migrating into the extravascular space the monocyte derived macrophages ingest lipids and become foam cells. Activation of the recruited leukocytes is believed to induce release of important mediators of inflammation e.g. pro inflammatory cytokines that serve to continue the process of lesion development. Smooth muscle cells are recruited to the fatty spot and together with the foam cells and lymphocytes form the fatty streak intermediate lesion . This entire process can continue leading to a fibrofatty lesion and ultimately to a fibrous plaque. Throughout plaque development the vascular endothelium remains intact. Since the mechanisms of atherogenesis are similar to those present in general pathological inflammation atherosclerosis is often considered a disease of pathological inflammation. Indeed it has recently been shown that inhibition of the potent pro inflammatory cytokine TNF reduces atherosclerosis in a murine model L. Branen et al. 24 2137 42 2004 .

Endothelial cell adhesion molecules ECAMs which are known to participate in leukocyte recruitment during pathological inflammation e.g VCAM 1 E selectin and ICAM 1 have been shown to be up regulated at sites of inflammation and to contribute to disease progression and or tissue damage by virtue of their role in leukocyte adhesion F. W. Luscinskas et al. 47 413 421 1996 . VCAM 1 has received the most interest in the context of atherosclerosis. VCAM 1 has been observed in a localized fashion on aortic endothelium that overlies early foam cell lesions M. I. Cybulsky et al. 251 788 791 1991 and has been shown to play an important role in monocyte and lymphocyte adhesion to and migration across the endothelium F. W. Luscinskas et al. 125 1417 27 1994 C. L. Ramos et al. 84 1237 44 1999 . Studies with the Apolipoprotein E deficient ApoE mouse a well accepted model of human atherosclerosis revealed that VCAM 1 is present on endothelium at lesion prone sites as early as 5 weeks and developed lesions Y. Nakashima et al. 18 842 51 1998 . Monocytes exhibit greatly increased adhesion to carotid arteries isolated from ApoE mice compared to carotid arteries isolated from wild type mice and this increased adhesion is mediated in part by VCAM 1 C. L. Ramos et al. 84 1237 44 1999 .

The expression of ECAMs is regulated in part by pro inflammatory cytokines e.g. TNF which increase the activity of certain transcription factors e.g. NF B M. J. May et al. 19 80 88 1998 and IRF 1 A. S Neish et al. 15 2558 2569 1995 . The activated or increased transcription factors bind to promoter elements on the ECAM genes. Several current or potential therapeutics for pathological inflammation work at least in part by modulating the activity of transcription factors to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and reduce inflammation in animal models E. M. Conner et al. 282 1615 1622 1997 J. W. Pierce et al. 156 3961 3969 1996 N. M. Dagia et al. 285 C813 C822 2003 C. Weber et al. 91 1914 1917 1995 .

One such group includes methimazole methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones Kohn L. D. et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 Apr. 2 2002. Kohn L. D. et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 801 986 2004 . When tested phenylmethimazole C10 reduced pro inflammatory e.g TNF induced ECAM expression and consequent leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 C10 i inhibits monocytic cell adhesion to cytokine inflamed human aortic endothelial cells HAEC under in vitro flow conditions that mimic conditions present in vivo ii strongly inhibits cytokine induced HAEC expression of VCAM 1 at the protein and mRNA level iii has a modest effect on E selectin expression and iv has very little effect on ICAM 1 expression.

The VCAM 1 promoter contains several cis elements known to play a role in TNF induced human VCAM 1 expression NF B AP 1 SP 1 IRF 1 and GATA. TNF stimulation of endothelial cells activates NF B M. J. May et al. 19 80 88 1998 however C10 does not appear to have any effect on NF B translocation to the nucleus or binding to the VCAM 1 promoter N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 . IRF 1 is present at a very low level in resting endothelial cells however upon stimulation with TNF IRF 1 is induced binds to the VCAM 1 promoter and is necessary for full cytokine induced transcriptional activation A. S Neish et al. 15 2558 2569 1995 N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 . C10 inhibits TNF induced IRF 1 expression at the protein and mRNA level. While several inhibitors of VCAM 1 are known very few if any have been shown to selectively suppress VCAM 1 to act via IRF 1 and to inhibit monocytic cell adhesion to cytokine inflamed endothelium under fluid shear.

The mechanism of TNF induction of IRF 1 in endothelial cells involves Stat1. The IRF 1 promoter region contains two NF B binding sites and an activated Stat1 GAS binding sequence Y. Ohmori et al. 272 14899 907 1997 H. Ochi et al. 32 1821 31 2002 . Although TNF activated NF B is directly involved in the activation of IRF 1 gene transcription NF B is insufficient for full expression and requires Stat1 occupation of the GAS site. Stat1 could be increased by indirect or direct means. Thus TNF could induce IRF 1 promoter activity by its effect on NF B an increase in type I IFN and the autocrine paracrine activation of Type I IFN on Stat1 O. Tliba et al. 278 50615 23 2003 Alternatively TNF may directly activate Stat1 since H. Ochi et al. 32 1821 31 2002 cycloheximide a protein synthesis inhibitor does not affect TNF induced IRF 1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC suggesting that TNF can induce increased IRF 1 expression without protein synthesis i.e. without de novo synthesis of IFN.

Several lines of evidence have emerged in the past several years which implicate TLRs in inflammatory autoimmune disorders. For example constitutive activation of immune cells caused by defective IL 10 signaling results in development of chronic enterocolitis K. Takeda et al. 10 39 49 1999 . Introduction of TLR4 deficiency into these mutant mice results in improvement of intestinal inflammation M. Kobayashi et al. 111 1297 308 2003 . Development of atherosclerosis observed in apolipoprotein E deficient mice is rescued by introduction of MyD88 deficiency implicating the TLR mediated pathway in the development of atherosclerosis K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 . Involvement of the TLR9 MyD88 dependent pathway in the induction of auto antibodies in SLE and rheumatoid arthritis is described above.

Overexpressed TLR3 TLR4 and TLR3 TLR4Signals in Nonimmune Cells as well as Monocytes Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Are Associated with Autoimmune inflammatory Diseases. Multiple autoimmune inflammatory diseases are now associated with overexpressed TLR3 and TLR4 and or their signals in nonimmune cells monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells. In the case of TLR3 TLR3 signaling these include Hashimoto s thyroiditis and Type 1 diabetes in the case of TLR4 TLR4 signaling these include ulcerative colitis Crohn s atherosclerosis and toxic shock. Overexpressed TLR3 4 or TLR3 4 signaling is not limited to these disorders and includes any disease where TLR signaling is activated and increases type I IFNs or cytokine increased ECAM expression and leukocyte adhesion e.g. systemic lupus rheumatoid arthritis or any autoimmune inflammatory disease.

Hashimoto s Thyroiditis. It is well recognized that TLR3 on dendritic cells recognize dsRNA then signal increases in cytokines and recognition molecules important for immune cell interactions. TLR3 mRNA and protein are now recognized to be expressed on thyrocytes and associated with Hashimoto s thyroiditis N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 . TLR3 are functional since incubating thyroid cells with Poly I C causes i transcriptional activation of both the NF B Elk1 and IRF 3 IFN signal paths ii post transcriptional activation of NF B and ERK1 2 and iii increased IFN mRNA. TLR3 can be overexpressed along with PKR major histocompatibility complex MHC I or II and IRF 1 by transfecting dsRNA into the cells infection with Influenza A virus or incubation with IFN but not by incubation with dsRNA or IFN gamma or by dsDNA transfection. Methimazole MMI and derivatives e.g. phenylmethimazole C10 significantly prevents overexpression by inhibiting increased transcriptional activation of IRF 3 and ISREs STAT phosphorylation but not NF 6 activation. TLR3 can be functionally overexpressed in cultured human thyrocytes by dsRNA transfection or IFN treatment. Immunohistochemical studies show TLR3 protein is overexpressed in human thyrocytes surrounded by immune cells in 100 of patients with Hashimoto s thyroiditis examined but not in normal or Graves thyrocytes. Without wishing to be bound by theory in any way it can be concluded that functional TLR3 are present on thyrocytes TLR3 downstream signals can be overexpressed by pathogen related stimuli overexpression can be reversed by C10 MMI by inhibiting only the IRF 3 IFN STAT arm of the TLR3 signal system and TLR3 overexpression can induce an innate immune response in thyrocytes which may be important in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto s thyroiditis and in the immune cell infiltrates.

Hashimoto s thyroiditis the most frequent tissue specific autoimmune disease in humans is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland by B and T lymphocytes cellular and humoral autoimmunity and autoimmune destruction of the thyroid C. M. Dayan et al. 335 99 107 1996 . Thyrocytes of patients with Hashimoto s thyroiditis express ICAM 1 B7 1 essential co stimulatory molecules important for immune cell interactions major histocompatibility complex MHC class I interferon IFN inducible protein IP 10 a CXCL chemokine that exerts a chemotactic activity on lymphoid cells and Fas gene a member of the closely linked group of tumor necrosis factor genes G. Pesce et al. 25 289 95 2002 M. A. Garcia Lopez et al. 86 5008 16 2001 .

Infectious agents have been implicated in the induction of autoimmune disease J. Guardiola et al. 13 247 68 1993 R. Gianani et al. 93 2257 9 1996 M. S. Horwitz et al. 4 781 5 1998 H. Wekerle 4 770 1 1998 C. Benoist et al. 394 227 8 1998 including thyroiditis Y. Tomer et al. 14 107 20 1993 . In the 1990 s it was suggested that viral triggering of autoimmunity might result from local infection of tissues induction of abnormal or increased expression of MHC genes presentation of self antigens to immune cells and bystander activation of T cells M. S. Horwitz et al. 4 781 5 1998 H. Wekerle Nat Med 4 770 1 1998 C. Benoist et al. 394 227 8 1998 .

Endotoxic Shock. A variety of studies have implicated TLR4 in endotoxic shock. For example C3H HeJ mice have a point mutation in the Tlr4 gene that results in defects in TLR4 signaling and hypo responsiveness to challenge with LPS K. Hoshino et al. 162 3749 52 1999 . Recent work G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 found strong evidence that endothelial TLR4 as opposed to leukocyte TLR4 is a critical player in endotoxic shock. Thus mice deficient in endothelial TLR4 but not leukocyte TLR4 had significantly attenuated leukocyte sequestration in the lungs subsequent to challenge with LPS.

Cultured murine macrophages for example RAW 264.7 cells when treated with LPS display a rapid induction of many genes which are regulators of the inflammatory response and are considered an in vitro model of changes in endotoxic shock M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 . LPS stimulated genes in cultured murine macrophages include genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines IFN IL 1 TNF IL 6 and IL 12 which act on either the macrophages monocytes themselves or on other target cells to regulate the inflammatory process which occurs in septic shock. Upon stimulation with LPS macrophages can also produce CXC chemokines such as IP 10 which serve to further attract immune cells to a site of inflammation K. M. Kopydlowski et al. 163 1537 44 1999 . Macrophages stimulated with LPS can also produce nitric oxide NO as a result of expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme iNOS C. Bogdan 2 907 16 2001 . Each of these factors considered to be important in the pathogenesis of septic shock are typically absent or found at extremely low levels in unstimulated macrophages.

Binding of IFN to the type I interferon receptor results in phosphorylation of Stat I as a key component for the transduction of a signal to the nucleus to induce expression of iNOS and IP 10 in the mouse macrophage Y. Ohmori et al. 69 598 604 2001 . Stat1 null animals show an approximately 50 enhanced survival rate when challenged with a lethal dose of LPS M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 whereas IFN null mice challenged with a lethal LPS dose showed a 100 enhancement of survival M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 Therefore blocking parts of the IFN signal pathway is not as effective as blocking the pathway completely.

LPS treatment of macrophage monocytes increases levels of Interferon Response factor IRF 1 M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 . IRF 1 acts as a transcription factor to directly bind to DNA to enhance transcription of other genes such as iNOS R. Kamijo et al. 263 1612 5 1994 . In macrophages treated with LPS IRF 1 is required for the transcriptional control of the iNOS gene R. Kamijo et al. 263 1612 5 1994 . Several other IRF 1 target genes exist such as the interferon inducible MX gene which codes for the antiviral Mx protein D. Damino et al. 13 454 60 2001 . The MX promoter has been shown to contain strong IRF 1 binding elements C. E. Grant et al. 28 4790 9 2000 .

The proinflammatory cytokines IL 1 TNF IL 6 and IL 12 can be induced by LPS signaling through TLR4 M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 and play a role in endotoxic shock N. C. Riedemann et al. 112 460 7 2003 . However a recent report identified IFN as a critical secondary effector which is induced upon LPS activation of TLR4 signaling and contributes to mortality in a murine septic shock model M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 .

Inflammatory Bowel Disease IBD . TLR4 and components of normal gastrointestinal gram negative bacteria appear to play a key role in the pathogenesis of colitis C. Fiocchi 115 182 205 1998 E. Cario et al. 68 7010 7 2000 . The disease is associated with severe inflammation edema and leukocyte infiltration in the colonic tissues C. Fiocchi 115 182 205 1998 E. Cario et al. 68 7010 7 2000 U. P. Singh et al. 171 1401 6 2003 M. B. Grisham et al. 55 64 1999 . There is increased interferon IFN production and secretion and increased levels of cytokines including TNF and IL 1 that up regulate endothelial cell adhesion molecules ECAMs in particular VCAM 1 which are associated with leukocyte adhesion. There are increased chemokine levels such as IP 10 which is known to be colitis related U. P. Singh et al. 171 1401 6 2003 .

Cario et al. E. Cario et al. 68 7010 7 2000 reported that TLR4 was upregulated in intestinal epithelial cell lines isolated from patients with IBD. Using the dextran sodium sulfate DSS induced murine model of colitis related to Crohn s and ulcerative colitis Ortega Cava et al. C. F. Ortega Cava et al. 170 3977 85 2003 found that TLR4 is upregulated in the colon of colitic mice relative to normal mice. Enterocolitis was reported to be significantly improved in TLR4 Stat3 deficient mice whereas TNF Stat3 deficient mice still had severe enterocolitis also indicating the importance of TLR4 in mouse models of enterocolitis M. Kobayashi et al. 111 1297 308 2003 .

Atherosclerosis and the Vascular Complications of Types 1 and 2 Diabetes Obesity and Hypertension Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of TLR4 in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 . Thus mouse knockout studies and studies of human TLR4 polymorphisms have demonstrated that TLR4 plays a role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and vascular disease. Further K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 mice deficient in endothelial cell TLR4 had a significant reduction in aortic plaque development in atherosclerosis prone apolipoprotein E deficient ApoE mice and the lack of TLR4 signaling can result in reduced monocyte adhesion to TLR4 endothelium.

The model that has emerged is that oxidized LDL enteroviruses or enterobacteria act as noxious injurious events to increase TLR expression in areas of turbulent blood flow. The increase in the MyD88 pathway NF B and the cytokine TNF increase VCAM 1 and attract leukocytes. Thus it is already suggested that it is important to not only block high lipids and or high blood pressure that induce damage at the lesion foci but also to block pathologic TLR4 induction and signaling causing immune cell attraction and leukocyte adhesion G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 .

Type 1 Diabetes A recent report has associated overexpressed TLR3 in pancreatic cells and destructive changes in Type 1 diabetes L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 . Moreover the report showed dsRNA could induce insulinitis and type 1 diabetes in animals consistent with the known animal model wherein coxsacki virus induces Type 1 diabetes in NOD mice. Devendra and Eisenbarth D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 point out that a wide variety of studies have implicated enteroviruses as a potential agent in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes suggesting that the mechanism of viral infection leading to cell destruction involves the cytokine interferon alpha IFN a Type 1 IFN like IFI and hypothesize that activation of TLR by dsRNA and induction of IFN may activate or accelerate immune mediated beta cell destruction. They conclude D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 that therapeutic agents targeting IFN may potentially be beneficial in the prevention of type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity. 

Type I diabetes appears to require a permissive genetic background and an external factor which may be viral. Islet cell antibodies are common in the first months of the disease. They probably arise in part due to cell injury and represent a primary autoimmune disease. The preeminent metabolic abnormality in Type 1 diabetes is hyperglycemia and glucosuria. Late complications of diabetes are numerous and include increased atherosclerosis with attendant stroke and heart complications kidney disease and failure and neuropathy that can be totally debilitating. The link to HLA antigens has been known since 1970. Certain HLA alleles are associated with increased frequency of disease others with decreased frequency. Increased MHC class I and aberrant MHC class II expression in islet cells has been described G. F. Bottazzo et al. 313 353 60 1985 A. K. Foulis et al. 35 1215 24 1986 . A definitive link to MHC class I has been made in a genetic animal model of the disease. Thus MHC class I deficiency results in resistance to the development of diabetes in the NOD mouse D. V. Serreze et al. 43 505 9 1994 L. S. Wicker et al. 43 500 4 1994 . Combined with recent TLR3 data and data from Coxsackie virus mouse models it is hypothesized that infection or environmental induction of Type 1 diabetes occurs in a genetically susceptible mammal that GAD and anti islet cell antibodies are abnormal for a prolonged latent phase before total islet cell destruction and that TLR induced changes in MHC genes are important in disease expression.

Environmental Inducers of Autoimmune Inflammatory Disease The TLR signaling pathway and its pathologic expression in nonimmune cells represents an intriguing link between viral agents and autoimmune inflammatory disease. For example multiple viruses have been linked to type 1 diabetes e.g. Coxsackie B4 virus J. Guardiola et al. 13 247 68 1993 R. Gianani et al. 93 2257 9 1996 M. S. Horwitz et al. 4 781 5 1998 H. Wekerle 4 770 1 1998 C. Benoist et al. 394 227 8 1998 Y. Tomer et al. 14 107 20 1993 M. F. Prummel et al. 13 547 51 2003 G. S. Cooper et al. 28 2653 6 2001 M. M. Ward et al. 152 2082 8 1992 . The involvement of other noxious environmental events is also suspected.

One example of a noxious environmental induction process is tobacco and smoking. Many epidemiologic studies have found a positive association between smoking and autoimmune inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis autoantibodies Raynaud phenomenon Goodpasture syndrome and Graves disease I. Roitt 7th ed. 312 346 1991 S. A. Jimenez et al. 140 37 50 2004 C. Nagata et al. 34 333 7 1995 . A significant increase in the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE has been indicated as well as rapid development of end stage renal disease in these patients G. S. Cooper et al. 28 2653 6 2001 M. M. Ward et al. 152 2082 8 1992 Smoking is an independent risk factor for diabetes and aggravates the risk of serious disease and premature death E. B. Rimm et al. 83 211 4 1993 E. B. Rimm et al. 310 555 9 1995 N. Kawakami et al. 145 103 9 1997 D. Haire Joshu et al. 22 1887 98 1999 J. C. Will et al. 30 540 6 2001 . Results from both cross sectional and prospective studies show enhanced risk for micro and macrovascular disease as well as premature mortality from the combination of smoking and diabetes. On the molecular and cellular levels a potentially important pathogenic mechanism is the production of chemically altered DNA by reactive elements in cigarette smoke resulting in the production of autoantibodies specifically against altered DNA B. H. Hahn 338 1359 68 1998 J. B. Winfield et al. 59 90 6 1977 . Additionally smoking enhances the ability of high glucose levels to affect the walls of the arteries making them more likely to develop fatty deposits. Smoking enhances a diabetic s chance of having high blood pressure high levels of lipids such as triglycerides and lower levels of the protective HDL cholesterol. Cigarette smoking may thus act in concert with other environmental triggers such as obesity or infectious agents and can be construed as a major and related environmental factor in the development of diabetes and its complications.

Therefore it is evident that Hashimoto s thyroiditis may be grouped with insulinitis and Type 1 diabetes colitis toxic shock and atherosclerosis as an autoimmune inflammatory disease associated with TLR3 or TLR4 overexpression and signaling in nonimmune cells monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells by an induction process involving molecular signatures of environmental pathogens K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 C. Fiocchi 115 182 205 1998 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 . The present invention provides for the use of phenylmethimazoles methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases associated with TLR3 or TLR4 overexpression and signaling in nonimmune cells as well as monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells. It additionally provides for the use of phenylmethimazoles methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases associated with pathologic activation of TLR signaling involving activation of IRF 3 synthesis of Type 1 IFN activation of STATs increased IRF 1 gene expression and activation of proteins with ISRE elements.

 Atherosclerosis is a form of chronic vascular injury in which some of the normal vascular smooth muscle cells in the artery wall which ordinarily control vascular tone regulating blood flow change their nature and develop cancer like behavior. These vascular smooth muscle cells become abnormally proliferative and responsive to inflammatory growth factors then secrete tissue degradation enzymes and other proteins which enable them to invade and spread into the inner vessel lining where they engulf fat and inflammatory debris lyse and repetitively cycle thereby expanding the inner inflamed lining of the blood vessels. This process reduces vascular diameter blocking blood flow and making that vessel abnormally susceptible to being completely blocked by leukocytes and platelets which adhere to adhesion molecules overexpressed on the vascular endothelium. Local blood clotting ensues resulting in the death of the tissue served by that artery.

It will be recognized that certain of the above statins contain either a free carboxylic acid or a free amine group as part of the chemical structure. Further certain statins within the scope of this invention contain lactone moieties which exist in equilibrium with the free carboxylic acid form. These lactones can be maintained as carboxylates by preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the lactone. Thus this invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of those carboxylic acids or amine groups. The expression pharmaceutically acceptable salts includes both pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts. The expression pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts is intended to define but is not limited to such salts as the alkali metal salts e.g. sodium and potassium alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium and magnesium aluminum salts ammonium salts and salts with organic amines such as benzathine N N dibenzylethylenediamine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine meglumine N methylglucamine benethamine N benzylphenethylamine diethylamine piperazine tromethamine 2 amino 2 hydroxymethyl 1 3 propanediol and procaine. The expression pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts is intended to define but is not limited to such salts as the hydrochloride hydrobromide sulfate hydrogen sulfate phosphate hydrogen phosphate dihydrogenphosphate acetate succinate citrate methanesulfonate mesylate and p toluenesulfonate tosylate salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts of statins containing free carboxylic acids may be readily prepared by reacting the free acid form of the statin with an appropriate base usually one equivalent in a co solvent. Typical bases are sodium hydroxide sodium methoxide sodium ethoxide sodium hydride potassium methoxide magnesium hydroxide calcium hydroxide benzathine choline diethanolamine piperazine and tromethamine. The salt is isolated by concentration to dryness or by addition of a non solvent. In many cases salts are preferably prepared by mixing a solution of the acid with a solution of a different salt of the cation sodium or potassium ethylhexanoate magnesium oleate employing a solvent e.g. ethyl acetate from which the desired cationic salt precipitates or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and or addition of a non solvent.

The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of statins containing free amine groups may be readily prepared by reacting the free base form of the statin with the appropriate acid. When the salt is of a monobasic acid e.g. the hydrochloride the hydrobromide the p toluenesulfonate the acetate the hydrogen form of a dibasic acid e.g. the hydrogen sulfate the succinate or the dihydrogen form of a tribasic acid e.g. the dihydrogen phosphate the citrate at least one molar equivalent and usually a molar excess of the acid is employed. However when such salts as the sulfate the hemisuccinate the hydrogen phosphate or the phosphate are desired the appropriate and exact chemical equivalents of acid will generally be used. The free base and the acid are usually combined in a co solvent from which the desired salt precipitates or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and or addition of a non solvent.

 Toll like receptors or TLRs are type transmembrane proteins containing repeated leucine rich motifs in their extracellular domains and a cytoplasmic tail that contains a conserved region called the Toll IL1 receptor TIR domain. At least 10 mammalian TLR proteins have been identified Toll like receptors 1 10. TLRs play a critical role in early innate immunity to invading pathogens by sensing microorganisms or noxious environmental agents. These evolutionarily conserved receptors homologues of the Toll gene recognize highly conserved structural motifs expressed by microbial pathogens called pathogen associated microbial patterns PAMPs and sense products of tissue damage by noxious agents or tissue injury for example dsRNA. PAMPs include various bacterial cell wall components such as lipopolysaccharide LPS peptidoglycan PGN and lipopeptides as well as flagellin bacterial DNA and viral double stranded RNA. TLR thus protect mammals from pathogenic organisms such as viruses bacteria parasitic agents or fungi and from tissue injury by generating an innate immune response to products of the pathogenic organism. They thus may additionally protect animals from noxious environmental agents that destroy cells and release dsRNA or other PAMPs that can interact with the TLR. The innate immune response results in increases in genes encoding several inflammatory cytokines chemokines as well as co stimulatory molecules and is critical for the development of antigen specific adaptive immunity. Stimulation of TLRs by PAMPs initiates a signaling cascade that involves a number of proteins such as MyD88 and IRAK1. This signaling cascade leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF kB which induces the secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL 1 and effector cytokines that direct the adaptive immune response. The signaling cascade additionally involves adaptors such as TRIF TICAM 1 which can signal the IRF 3 pathway to increase Type 1 IFN production activate Stats increase IRF 1 gene expression and activate ISRE s interferon response factor IRF elements. In the case of virus injection of dsRNA or single strand RNA with its replication can activate viral kinases bypass TLR activate PKR and IRF 3 and initiate the NF B and Type 1 IFN cascades which by the autocrine paracrine action of type 1 IFNs the cytokines and the chemokines can initiate the innate immune adaptive immune response sequence.

The formulations are administered to achieve a therapeutic effect. For those compounds that exhibit a long residency in the body a once a day regimen is possible. Alternatively multiple doses such as up to three doses per day typically may offer more effective therapy. Thus a single dose or a multidose regimen may be used.

The present invention also provides for methods of diagnosing treating and following therapeutic intervention in any autoimmune inflammatory disease mediated by or associated with TLR3 or TLR4 overexpression or signaling particularly in but not limited to nonimmune cells monocytes macrophages or dendritic cells or both TLR3 or TLR4 overexpression or signaling for example but not limited to Hashimoto s thyroiditis insulinitis Type 1 diabetes atherosclerosis vascular complications of type 1 or 2 diabetes vascular complications associated with obesity or hyperlipidemias toxic shock colitis or IBD and the various symptoms that fall within a definition of IBD. For example ulcerative colitis which is a disease of the large intestine characterized by overexpressed TLR4 and TLR4 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells involves chronic diarrhea with cramping abdominal pain rectal bleeding and loose discharges of blood pus and mucus. The manifestations of this disease vary widely. A pattern of exacerbations and remissions typifies the clinical course of most ulcerative colitis patients 70 although continuous symptoms without remission are present in some patients with ulcerative colitis. Systemic complications of ulcerative colitis include arthritis eye inflammation such as uveitis skin ulcers and liver disease. In addition ulcerative colitis and especially long standing extensive disease is associated with an increased risk of colon carcinoma. Similarly Type I diabetes is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by overexpressed TLR3 and TLR3 signaling in pancreatic P cells monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells characterized by a prolonged inflammatory state or insulinitis a honeymoon period or lag phase with islet cell and GAD auto antibodies a destructive phase resulting in loss of insulin secretion hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia and tissue complications such as macro and microvascular diseases including atherosclerosis strokes myocardial infarcts nephropathy neuropathy retinopathy and higher incidences of autoimmune thyroid disease and cancer.

In any event the pharmaceutical composition is administered in such a manner so that compound is delivered into the patient s bloodstream. One excellent mode for accomplishing this is intravenous administration. Intravenous dose levels range from about 0.01 mg kg hour of active amide compound to about 100 mg kg hour all for from about 1 to about 120 hours and especially 1 to 96 hours. A preloading bolus of from about 0.001 to about 500 mg may also be administered to achieve adequate steady state levels. Other forms of parenteral administration such as intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection can be used as well. In this case similar dose levels are employed.

With oral dosing one to three oral doses per day each from about 0.001 to about 150 mg kg of active compound are employed with preferred doses being from about 0.05 to about 100 mg kg. With rectal dosing one to three rectal doses per day each from about 1 to about 150 mg kg of active compound are employed with preferred doses being from about 1 to about 100 mg kg.

In any treatment regimen the health care professional should assess the patient s condition and determine whether or not the patient would benefit from treatment. Some degree of routine dose optimization may be required to determine an optimal doing level and pattern. A positive dose response relationship has been observed. As such and bearing in mind the severity of the side effects and the advantages of providing maximum possible amelioration of symptoms it may be desired in some settings to administer large amounts of active compound such as those described above.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are administered such that appropriate levels of pharmaceutical active are achieved in the bloodstream. The precise dosage level required in a given case will depend upon for example the particular methimazole derivative used the nature of the disease being treated and the size weight age and physical condition of the patient.

The transit time through the gastro intestinal canal for different dosage forms are rather well known. When the dosage form has been emptied from the stomach the transit through the small intestine takes 3 to 5 hours. The residence time in the large intestine is considerably longer 25 to 50 hours. Ideally for local effects as long as the dosage form remains in the stomach no release should occur. If colitis in the small intestine is going to be treated the release should continue during about 5 hours after the dosage form has left the stomach. If the large intestine is going to be treated the local release should ideally start at caecum and continue for up to 50 hours.

The term composition as in pharmaceutical composition is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient s and the inert ingredient s pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that make up the carrier as well as any product which results directly or indirectly from combination complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by mixing a compound of the present invention additional active ingredient s and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.

The dosage frequency and mode of administration of each component of the combination can be controlled independently. For example one compound may be administered orally three times per day while the second compound may be administered intramuscularly once per day. Combination therapy may be given in on and off cycles that include rest periods. The compounds may also be formulated together such that one administration delivers both compounds.

The relative efficacies of compounds can be established by determining the concentrations at which each compound inhibits the activity to a predefined extent and then comparing the results. Typically the preferred determination is the concentration that inhibits 50 of the activity in a biochemical assay i.e. the 50 inhibitory concentration or IC. ICdeterminations can be accomplished using conventional techniques known in the art. In general an ICcan be determined by measuring the activity of a given enzyme in the presence of a range of concentrations of the inhibitor under study. The experimentally obtained values of activity then are plotted against the inhibitor concentrations used. The concentration of the inhibitor that shows 50 activity as compared to the activity in the absence of any inhibitor is taken as the ICvalue. Analogously other inhibitory concentrations can be defined through appropriate determinations of activity.

TLR3 is expressed in thyrocytes is functional can be pathologically overexpressed by viruses is associated with Hashimoto s thyroiditis and its pathological overexpressed state or signaling can be reversed by methimazole methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones.

TLR3 is present in thyrocytes. Using Northern blotting we showed that rat FRTL 5 thyrocytes contained detectable levels of a single 5.8 kb mRNA that hybridizes with a P labeled mouse TLR3 cDNA probe and is present in mouse spleen positive control . The presence of TLR3 on FRTL 5 thyrocytes grown in continuous culture was duplicated in intact mouse thyroids which had a similarly sized RNA. Specificity was indicated since neither human embryonic kidney HEK293 Chinese hamster ovary CHO K1 cell or mouse liver exhibited significant levels of a similar sized hybridizing band. Further evidence of specificity was the observation that TLR9 mRNA which is involved in the recognition of specific unmethylated CpG ODN sequences that distinguish bacterial DNA from mammalian DNA was not expressed basally in FRTL 5 cells despite its prominent appearance in spleen cells. The low level of TLR3 mRNA which we detected in mRNA from mouse heart is consistent with a previous report studying TLR3 expression in mouse heart lung brain and kidney L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 .

These data demonstrate for the first time that TLR3 mRNA is present basally in mouse thyroid tissue and rat thyroid cells. We could however also show TLR3 protein was expressed by Western blotting. Lysates of FRTL 5 cells were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal TLR3 antibody and resolved by SDS PAGE. An approximately 120 kDa protein was detected in FRTL 5 cell lysates immuno precipitated by the TLR3 MAb. As a positive control we showed that the TLR3 MAb detected a similarly sized TLR3 protein in CHO K1 cells transiently transfected with a human TLR3 expression vector or one from mouse. This was not the case when the CHO K1 cells were transfected with a human TLR4 expression vector demonstrating specificity of the protein identification and measurement procedure. These data established that TLR3 was expressed basally in thyrocytes the following experiments established the TLR3 was functional.

TLR3 is Functional in thyrocytes. Poly I C a chemically synthesized dsRNA that is a specific ligand for TLR3 K. Takeda et al. 21 335 76 2003 K. Takeda et al. 5 143 53 2003 L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 was added to the culture medium to stimulate TLR3 signaling. Extracellular dsRNA is known to be specifically recognized by TLR3 as evidenced by the lack of response to extracellular dsRNA in TLR3 mouse derived fibroblasts L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 TLR3 activation of the NF B p38MAPK and IRF 3 IFN signals bifurcate at TRIF K. Takeda et al. 21 335 76 2003 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 K. Takeda et al. 5 143 53 2003 H. Oshiumi et al. 4 161 7 2003 M. Yamamoto et al. 169 6668 72 2002 M. Miettinen et al. 2 349 55 2001 Z. Jiang et al. 101 3533 8 2004 We asked if both of these pathways were activated in FRTL 5 thyroid cells.

The presence of the NF 6B pathway was evaluated by incubating extracellular dsRNA Poly I C with pNF B luc transfected FRTL 5 cells and measuring reporter gene activity and by EMSA in nontransfected cells using an NF B consensus oligonucleotide probe. Poly I C increased NF B Luc activity by comparison to non treated cells or cells incubated with dsDNA. Poly I C incubation also increased formation of a p65 p50 NF B complex as evidenced by the appearance of a major complex whose formation was inhibited by incubations containing the nuclear extracts from treated cells with anti p50 or anti p65 but not by incubations with anti c rel anti p52 or anti relB which served as negative antibody controls.

In the case of incubation with anti p50 and anti p65 the data were similar to results in studies of p50 p65 binding to the MHC class I G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 C. Giuliani et al. 270 11453 62 1995 S. I. Taniguchi et al. 12 19 3 1998 or VCAM 1 promoter N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 . Cells treated with IL 1 TNF or the phorbol ester TPA served as positive controls for formation of the p65 p50 complex in the FRTL 5 cells.

Poly I C incubation was also able to activate ERK1 2 MAPK within 15 min as detected by measuring phosphorylated ERK1 2 in immunoblots. Lysates from insulin treated FRTL 5 cells were used as a positive control. Elk1 was also transactivated by Poly I C treatment of reporter gene coupled ELK 1 in FRTL 5 cell transfectants as measured by luciferase activity. IL 1 treatment which can activate ELK 1 K. Takeda et al. 21 335 76 2003 served as a positive control.

Most importantly and most relevant to the effect of methimazole methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones on TLR3 activity we could show that the TLR3 IRF 3 IFN coupled signal system was also expressed in FRTL 5 thyroid cells. Poly I C incubations increased both IFN promoter activity and IFN mRNA levels . IFN promoter activity was measured by incubating Poly I C with FRTL 5 cells transfected with pIFN luc constructs. Poly I C incubation strongly increased IFN promoter activity whereas dsDNA had no effect left panel . As a control it was demonstrated that pIFN luc transfected HEK293 cells which do not have endogenous TLR3 failed to respond to Poly I C incubation unless they were first transfected with a human TLR3 expression plasmid right panel . Although Northern analysis did not detect significant levels of IFN mRNA RT PCR analysis using gene specific primers S. Yokoyama et al. 232 698 701 1997 demonstrated that IFN mRNA was increased in FRTL 5 cells by the addition of Poly I C .

Since IRF 3 must be activated as an intermediate to increase IFN gene expression in the TRIF pathway coupled to TLR3 K. Takeda et al. 5 143 53 2003 H. Oshiumi et al. 4 161 7 2003 M. Yamamoto et al. 169 6668 72 2002 Z. Jiang et al. 101 3533 8 2004 we additionally showed that Poly I C incubation increased IRF 3 transactivation activity in FRTL 5 thyrocytes . Incubation with IL 1 again served as a positive control.

To see if the TRIF adaptor protein could couple TLR3 and signal generation in FRTL 5 cells we asked whether co transfection of wild type TIR domain containing molecule adapter inducing IFN TIR containing adapter molecule TRIF TICAM 1 would enhance Poly I C induced IFN gene activation. Exogenous expression of TRIF TICAM 1 in FRTL 5 cells enhanced the Poly I C induced IFN promoter activity in a dose dependent manner but did not enhance IL 1 increased IFN promoter activity . IL 1 negative control does not activate IRF 3 and IFN by a TRIF coupling mechanism D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 E. Cario et al. 68 7010 7 2000 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 Z. Jiang et al. 101 3533 8 2004 M. Muzio et al. 164 5998 6004 2000 . Overexpression of wild type or dominant negative DN MyD88 negative controls did not result in any significant Poly I C induced IFN promoter activation or inhibition nor did they significantly activate or inhibit Poly I C increased NF 6B luciferase activity data not shown .

In sum FRTL 5 cells not only express the TLR3 receptor they seem to signal through both the NF 6B and IRF 3 IFN pathways when incubated with extracellular Poly I C similar to immune cells. Their dual activation results in gene responses characteristic of an innate immune response K. Takeda et al. 21 335 76 2003 K. Takeda et al. 5 143 53 2003 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 .

Overexpression of TLR3 and TLR signaling in thyroid cells by dsRNA transfection or viral infection Type I IFN is an important intermediate.

dsRNA transfection and IFN induce overexpression of TLR and TLR3 signaling Incubating FRTL 5 thyroid cells with Poly I C did not increase TLR3 PKR or MHC Class I mRNA levels over a 24 hour period although Poly I C incubation significantly increased IP 10 mRNA and slightly increased ICAM 1 mRNA levels demonstrating the functional activity of the Poly I C in this experiment . IL 1 the positive control also caused an increase in IP 10 and ICAM 1 mRNA levels but did not change TLR3 Class I or PKR mRNA levels . This suggested that dsRNA incubation with TLR3 was not an effective means of increasing TLR3 expression in FRTL 5 cells nor induce changes in genes important in the expression of autoimmune inflammatory diseases.

In sharp contrast to the Poly I C incubation data transfection of Poly I C into the cytoplasm of FRTL 5 cells strongly increased TLR3 mRNA as well as MHC Class I PKR ICAM 1 and IP 10 mRNA levels both 12 and 24 hrs after transfection by comparison to control cells C or a mock transfection L without dsRNA lanes 3 and 7 . Unlike dsRNA dsDNA transfection was only weakly effective in increasing TLR3 mRNA and at 12 hrs only lanes 4 and 8 but as previously reported K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 was effective in increasing PKR and MHC Class I as well as ICAM 1 and IP 10 mRNA levels 12 hrs after transfection by comparison to control cells C or a mock transfection L lanes 1 2 5 and 6 . These results suggest that the transfected dsRNA action to increase TLR 3 is different from the ability of dsRNA to bind to TLR3 during incubations and to induce signaling by a receptor ligand interaction. They also showed dsRNA transfection appeared to be different from the action of dsDNA transfection. These results further indicated that overexpression of TLR3 in nonimmune cells requires a pathogenic stimulus not simply binding of dsRNA to the TLR3.

As reported K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 dsRNA transfection and dsDNA transfection differ primarily in the induction of IFN but not PKR. Nevertheless to evaluate a possible role of PKR activation in TLR3 overexpression by transfected dsRNA we treated cells with 2 aminopurine 2 AP a PKR inhibitor L. J. Mundschau et al. 270 3100 6 1995 . TLR3 mRNA was still increased by dsRNA transfection by comparison to control cells C or a mock transfection L in the presence of 2 AP lane 7 vs 3 . Like the case for TLR3 expression 2 AP did not inhibit the dsRNA transfection induced increase in IFN mRNA levels lane 7 vs 3 however 2 AP strongly inhibited the ability of dsRNA transfection to increase NF B p65 p50 complex formation in EMSA bottom . Moreover whereas the dsRNA transfection induced increase in PKR and MHC Class I was only slightly decreased by 10 mM 2 AP lane 7 vs 3 the dsDNA transfection induced increase in PKR was eliminated and the increase in MHC I was reduced to near control levels lane 8 vs 4 . This suggested a different mechanism of upregulation of PKR and MHC class I by the two transfecting agents the dsDNA effect possibly linked to NF 6B activation whereas the dsRNA transfection effect potentially more linked to IRF 3 IFN signaling. We have reported that dsDNA transfection together with the TSHR in fibroblasts can result in Graves disease if the fibroblasts are killed with mitomycin and injected intraperitoneally over the course of six weeks L. D. Kohn et al. In press 2005 K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 L. D. Kohn et al. 19 633 64 2000 N. Shimojo et al. 19 619 31 2000 K. Suzuki et al. 127 234 42 2002 . The dsDNA effect may be consistent with the activity of TLR9 which is not present basally but could be expressed in the lysosomal endosomal fractions of thyrocytes after transfection and phagocytosis.

The possibility that Type I interferon produced by dsRNA transfection might be an autocrine paracrine activator of thyrocytes post dsRNA transfection was considered and confirmed. Like mouse macrophages M. Miettinen et al. 2 349 55 2001 exogenously added Type I IFN in our case IFN increased TLR3 mRNA levels in FRTL 5 thyrocytes in a time and dose dependent manner Table 1 . The increases were not duplicated by a Type II IFN IFN even if a high dose 1000 Units ml of IFN was used Table 1 . IFN also increased MHC I PKR and IP 10 mRNA levels concurrent with the increase in TLR3 mRNA levels.

In Table 1 the effect of IFN or IFN on mRNA levels of TLR3 and several other genes was measured as a function of time. FRTL 5 cells were incubated with 100 U ml of IFN or IFN for between 1 and 12 hours. IFN duplicated the effect of dsRNA transfection by increasing TLR3 PKR MHC Class I and IP 10 RNA levels whereas IFN had no effect. Similarly when cells were stimulated with between 10 and 1000 units of IFN or IFN for 3 hours total RNA purified and 20 g of total RNA analyzed by Northern analysis using the radiolabeled cDNA probes of only IFN increased TLR3 PKR MHC Class I and IP 10 RNA levels.

In sum these experiments support the data that the mechanism of action of transfected dsRNA is distinct from that of transfected dsDNA K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 . The data support the possibility that IFN may be a mediator or autocrine paracrine intermediate in the ability of dsRNA transfection to increase TLR3. It additionally appears that the action of dsDNA but not dsRNA transfection is entirely PKR dependent and coupled solely to the NF 6B signal pathway. In contrast the dsRNA transfection induced increases in IFN PKR and MHC I mRNA probably result from activation of a signal by the IRF 3 related signal path linked to a viral activated kinase VAK now known to involve 16B related kinases IKK IKKepsilon TANK binding kinase 1 TBK1 S. Sharma et al. 300 1148 51 2003 K. A. Fitzgerald et al. 4 491 6 2003 Z. Jiang et al. 101 3533 8 2004 M. J. Servant et al. 276 355 63 2001 M. J. Servant et al. 22 49 58 2002 M. J. Servant et al. 278 9441 7 2003 J. Hiscott et al. 1010 237 48 2003 H. Hemmi et al. 199 1641 50 2004 .

Influenza A virus mimics the action of dsRNA transfection and IFN to induce overexpression of TLR and TLR3 signaling The ability of dsRNA transfection but not dsRNA incubation to increase TLR3 levels is presumed to mimic the action of a virus to inject RNA into the cell as previously suggested M. Yamamoto et al. 169 6668 72 2002 M. Miettinen et al. 2 349 55 2001 L. Alexopoulou et al. 413 732 8 2001 S. Sharma et al. 300 1148 51 2003 K. A. Fitzgerald et al. 4 491 6 2003 Z. Jiang et al. 101 3533 8 2004 J. Guardiola et al. 13 247 68 1993 R. Gianani et al. 93 2257 9 1996 M. S. Horwitz et al. 4 781 5 1998 H. Wekerle 4 770 1 1998 C. Benoist et al. 394 227 8 1998 Y. Tomer et al. 14 107 20 1993 K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 J. Hiscott et al. 1010 237 48 2003 H. Hemmi et al. 199 1641 50 2004 . To test this possibility we infected FRTL 5 cells with influenza A virus a single strand RNA virus.

Treatment of FRTL 5 cells with influenza A for 24 hours mimicked the ability of dsRNA transfection to overexpress TLR3 mRNA as measured by Northern analysis and increase IFN mRNA as measured by PCR . Of note both dsRNA transfection and influenza A infection also caused increases in IRF 1 and MHC class II mRNA levels the less impressive MHC II complex induced by dsRNA transfection is consistent with our previous results indicating a greater response of MHC I than II K Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 . The data were obtained at an MOI of 1 and were not duplicated by Coxsackie or Herpes simplex infection at the same or 10 fold higher MOIs data not shown . Viral specificity remains to be further investigated as will be discussed below.

The increase in MHC class II compliments the increase in class I by dsRNA transfection already demonstrated K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 . The increase in IRF 1 is interesting since IRF 1 gene overexpression is required for optimal TNF increased VCAM 1 gene expression and leukocyte adhesion as well as NF B N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 The present data would suggest that IRF 1 gene overexpression results from the same pathogenic stimuli that cause TLR3 overexpression. In the following experiments we demonstrate that phenylmethimazole C10 and MMI i.e. methimazole methimazole derivatives or tautomeric cyclic thiones inhibit Stat1 phosphorylation which regulates IRF 1 gene expression R. Pine et al. 13 158 67 1994 and that this effect reflects an action to inhibit the TRIF couples IRF 3 IFN not the TRIF coupled NF 6B signal pathway.

Phenylmethimazole C 10 a tautomeric cyclic thione and methimazole derivative inhibits TLR3 signaling through the IRF 3 ISRE STAT pathway in thyrocytes.

C10 and MMI inhibit TLR3 expression and signaling. Methimazole MMI is used to treat autoimmune Graves disease and is effective in part because it inhibits thyroid hormone formation D. S. Cooper 311 1353 62 1984 . However MMI contributes to long term remission of autoimmune inflammatory diseases by functioning as a broadly active immunomodulator. Thus MMI has been used as an immunosuppressive in treating psoriasis in humans A. N. Elias et al. 34 280 3 1995 and in treating murine models of systemic lupus autoimmune blepharitis autoimmune uveitis thyroiditis and diabetes L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 April 2002 C. C. Chan et al. 154 4830 5 1995 T. F. Davies et al. 73 397 404 1984 P. Wang et al. 73 57 64 2003 . It is a transcriptional inhibitor of abnormally increased MHC Class I and II gene expression in FRTL 5 cells and has been suggested to mimic the effect of a Class I knockout in preventing autoimmune disease M. Saji et al. 75 871 8 1992 V. Montani et al. 139 290 302 1998 L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 2002 E. Mozes et al. 261 91 3 1993 D. S. Singer et al. 153 873 80 1994 . Phenylmethimazole C10 is a derivative that is 50 100 fold more potent in suppressing MHC gene expression L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 2002 .

We evaluated the ability of C10 and MMI to inhibit TLR3 expression and signaling. C10 prevented the ability of dsRNA transfection and incubation with IFN to increase TLR3RNA levels in FRTL 5 cells as measured by PCR . Additionally it prevented the ability of both IFN and dsRNA transfection data not shown to increase TLR3 by Northern analysis and was significantly better than MMI in this respect even at 10 fold lower concentrations 0.5 vs 5 mM . DMSO is the vehicle for C10 because of the hydrophobicity of C10 it had no significant effect on basal activity and was used as the control value in all experiments described herein.

The C 10 and MMI reduced the ability of IFN to increase PKR and MHC class I RNA levels albeit relatively less than TLR3 . C10 slightly reduced the basal level of TLR 3 mRNA without affecting control PKR or class I RNA levels lane 2 vs 1 . The Northern data thus suggested C10 to a far greater extent than MMI could block pathogenic expression of the TLR3 induced innate immune response in FRTL 5 thyrocytes. We questioned the C10 mechanism of action.

C10 at 0.5 mM inhibited the ability of poly I C to increase IFN promoter activity luciferase luminescence P

These data confirm that FRTL 5 thyrocytes have functional IL 1 receptors see also . IL 1 receptors are reported to activate IRF 3 and IFN by a non TRIF coupling mechanism D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 E. Carlo et al. 68 7010 7 2000 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 M. Muzio et al. 164 5998 6004 2000 S. E. Doyle et al. 170 3565 71 2003 . The predominant target of LPS is TLR4 we could demonstrate TLR4 mRNA on FRTL 5 cells but no ability of LPS or poly I C to increase TLR4 mRNA data not shown . These data would suggest that C10 and to a significantly lesser degree MMI can inhibit the increase IFN luciferase activity independent of the specific receptor activated TLR3 TLR4 or IL 1 or the coupling protein utilized TRIF or non TRIF Top Left . These data suggested that a common denominator by which C10 might act was downstream i.e. it might inhibit IRF 3 transactivation.

We measured the ability of C10 to inhibit IRF 3 transactivation activity in FRTL 5 thyrocytes using the IRF 3 cis reporter system bottom . We could show that incubation with 0.5 mM C 10 significantly P

A key to activation of other IFN inducible genes by the autocrine paracrine action of IFN is its action to regulate downstream genes with ISREs in part by phosphorylation of STATS which are important activators of interferon stimulated response elements ISRE and interferon activated sites GAS . Using an ISRE sequence coupled to luciferase as a reporter gene ISRE Luc we could show that C 10 was an effective inhibitor of ISRE activation by poly I C LPS IL 1 TNF IFN and IFN Table 2 . Despite the similarity in sequence between ISRE and NF 6B binding sites and despite the ability of Poly I C to activate NF 6B luc in FRTL 5 cells both 0.5 mM C10 or 5 mM MMI had a minimal effect on Poly I C increased NF 6B luciferase activity Table 2 . Additionally they did not have any significant effect on Poly I C or LPS increased p65 p50 complex formation .

As shown in Table 2 phenylmethimazole C10 inhibits the ability of Poly I C LPS IL 1 TNF IFN and IFN to activate an ISRE reporter gene in FRTL 5 thyrocytes. Cells were co transfected with ISRE Luc and pRLTk Int and then treated without none or with Poly I C 100 g ml LPS 100 ng ml IL 1 10 ng ml TNF 25 ng ml IFN 100 U ml or IFN 1000 U ml in the presence of DMSO or C10 for 6 hours. Data were obtained using the Dual Luciferase Assay system. The effect on the ISRE element is not duplicated by an NF B reporter plasmid despite the similarity of the two elements TAGTTTCACTTTCCC SEQ ID NO 3 vs. TGGGGACTTTCCGC SEQ ID NO 4 respectively. Data are representative of multiple experiments. C10 significantly inhibits the action of Poly I C LPS TNF IFN or IFN to increase expression of genes containing ISREs not NF B elements.

Additionally C10 was a profound inhibitor of virus or IFN stimulated data not shown Stat1 phosphorylation without a change in Stat1 total protein . D in this experiment was the vehicle DMSO control.

TLR3 expression and regulation in humans can be very different from that in rats or mice. To address this we first asked if TLR3 RNA was expressed in human thyroid tissue using commercial tissue blots from Clontech. We detected TLR3 RNA expression in thyroid tissue by comparison with the spleen positive control results were thus similar to our observations in mouse tissues.

In order to confirm the presence and functionality of TLR3 in human thyrocytes we evaluated TLR3 expression in cultured NPA human thyrocytes. NPA thyrocytes are from a papillary carcinoma but are known to retain functional properties of normal thyrocytes. Transfection with dsRNA Poly I C but not transfection by dsDNA or incubation with Poly I C was able to increase TLR3 mRNA levels in Northern blots. The dsRNA but not the dsDNA transfection could also increase IFN mRNA levels measured as before with PCR. Additionally as was the case for FRTL 5 cells and dsRNA transfection IFN increased PKR mRNA levels as well as TLR3 RNA levels. Finally as was again the case for FRTL 5 cells we could show that 0.5 mM C10 decreased the ability of dsRNA transfection or IFN to increase TLR3 mRNA levels.

A fundamental question posed by the sum of data thus far was whether TLR3 was overexpressed in autoimmune inflammatory disease in vivo not only human thyrocytes in culture. We evaluated TLR3 protein levels in human thyroid tissues by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry of thyroid tissues was performed using TLR3 antibody 1 100 . In normal thyroid and in tissues from Graves disease no immunoreactive TLR3 was detected. In chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis Hashimoto s TLR3 was detected in epithelial cells as indicated by brown deposit in cytoplasm in 100 of patients tested Table 3 . The intensity of staining was highest in metaplastic oxyphilic epithelium in the regions of lympho plasmacytic infiltration.

TLR3 and IFN are jointly upregulated in 95 of thyroids from patients with Hashimoto s thyroiditis Table 3 whereas PKR is upregulated in less than 50 of Hashimoto s thyroiditis patients Table 3 . Positive thyrocytes in these experiments appear brown and the absence of brown staining in lymphocytes in the IFN analyses was striking relative to the thyrocytes. The increase in TLR 3 signaled IRF 3 IFN in the Hashimoto s thyrocytes correlated with TLR3 overexpression in a statistically significant manner by comparison to the TLR3 and PKR association in Hashimoto s and when compared with the presence of IRF 3 IFN signaling in Graves vs TLR3 expression which was zero.

The presence of increased IRF 3 IFN signaling in Graves is consistent with the ability of dsDNA transfection and overexpressed TSHR to induce Graves L. D Kohn et al. US. Application Publication US2005 0036993 A1 Feb. 17 2005 . It is equally consistent with the expression of TLR9 activity in the case of Graves since TLR9 recognizes dsDNA and also signals through IRF 3 IFN .

The sum of these data are consistent with but not limited to the interpretation that TLR3 can be overexpressed in nonimmune cells and can produce an innate immune gene response that leads to an adaptive immune cell TH1 response. A critical signal system involved is Type I IFN. Methimazole methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones exemplified by C10 can prevent this by inhibiting predominantly the IRF 3 Type I IFN signal system activated when dsRNA or viruses overexpress TLR3 signals.

FRTL 5 cells were grown in 6H growth media until 60 confluence and then maintained in 5H TSH media for 7 days before infections. Ten 10 cm dishes were 95 100 confluent at the time of infection. Seven 7 million viral particles were added to each 10 cm dish of cells in 5H media. Fresh 5H media was added 24 hours prior to infection. Cells were incubated with virus for 24 hours at which point C10 was added directly to the media and incubated for 6 hours before cells were harvested.

Patients and Tissue Samples. Tissue specimens were obtained from 30 individuals treated at the Ukrainian Center of Endocrine Surgery in Kiev. Thyroid lesions were classified as Hashimoto s thyroiditis in 21 cases hyperplasia associated with Graves disease in 20 cases. Normal thyroid tissue was from the contralateral glands of 20 patients undergoing thyroid surgery for adenomas or tumors. After fixation in 10 formalin and embedding in paraffin 5 m thick serial sections were made for each specimen. The 5 m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Immunohistochemical Staining. Sections were dewaxed soaked in alcohol and after microwave treatment in antigen unmasking solution for 10 min incubated in 3 hydrogen peroxide for 15 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity. Then sections were incubated at 4 C. overnight with anti TLR3 antibody 1 100 dilution . Immunostaining was performed by use of the Vectastain Universal Quick kit according to the manufactured instruction. Peroxidase staining was revealed in 3 3 diaminobenzidine. Negative control was applied by omission of antiserum.

In Example 1 we show that TLR3 and IFN protein are expressed in situ in thyrocytes from patients with Hashimoto s thyroiditis which are surrounded by immune cells but not in thyrocytes from normal individuals or Graves autoimmune hyperthyroidism a novel finding never previously demonstrated. The results from human thyrocytes in culture indicate that TLR3 activation and functional increases in signaling can occur in human as well as rat thyrocytes in culture and this can occur in the absence of lymphocytes or a lymphocyte produced IFN since lymphocytes primarily produce type II interferon T. Taniguchi et al. 19 623 55 2001 . Consistent with this the immunocytochemistry study shows that the intense brown stain for IFN is localized in the thyrocytes and is not significant in the immune cells. The results thus raise the possibility that thyrocytes are affected by a primary insult which activates the TLR3 system to produce an innate immune response mimicking that of a dendritic cell. The resultant cytokine and co stimulatory molecule changes in the thyrocyte may then contribute to attracting lymphocytes to the gland since unlike dendritic cells the thyrocytes cannot migrate to the lymphoid organ.

The results herein are startlingly similar to studies of another disease with TLR3 involvement and overexpression a role for pathogen induction and dsRNA involvement of a Type 1 IFN as an apparent autocrine paracrine factor immune cell infiltrates and cell specific destruction causing hypofunction i.e. insulinitis and type 1 diabetes D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 . Wen et al. L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 show that dsRNA could induce insulinitis and type 1 diabetes in animals consistent with the known animal model wherein Coxsackie s virus induces Type 1 diabetes in NOD mice. Devendra and Eisenbarth D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 emphasize human relevance and note that enteroviruses have been the focus of many research studies as a potential agent in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. They note that the mechanism of viral infection leading to cell destruction involves IFN a Type I IFN like IFN . They hypothesize that activation of TLR by double stranded RNA or Poly IC a viral mimic through induction of IFN may activate or accelerate immune mediated cell destruction. They note that numerous clinical case reports have implicated IFN therapy with autoimmune diseases thyroiditis in particular see below and that elevated serum IFN levels have been associated with Type 1 diabetes as well as thyroid autoimmune inflammatory disease M. F. Prummel et al. 13 547 51 2003 . Taken together with data in the present report we considered the possibility of an important mechanistic association relevant to disease pathogenesis. Hashimoto s and Type 1 diabetes may have immune cell infiltrates and destructive thyrocyte or cell changes because of a primary insult to the specific tissue cell that activates TLR3 and an innate immune response in the tissue cells this may be an early event in the pathogenic mechanism D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 .

Devendra and Eisenbarth suggest D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 that therapeutic agents targeting IFN over production or activity may potentially be beneficial in the prevention of type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity. Example 1 looked at whether TLR3 overexpression signaling leading to increased Type I IFN levels might be sensitive to the immunomodulatory actions of methimazole MMI or its more potent derivative phenylmethimazole C10 M. Saji et al. 75 871 8 1992 V. Montani et al. 139 290 302 1998 L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 2002 E. Mozes et al. 261 91 3 1993 D. S. Singer et al. 153 873 80 1994 and how the data indicate that C10 to a significantly greater extent than MMI blocks overexpression of TLR TLR signaling by inhibition of the TLR3 regulated IRF 3 IFN ISRE STAT signal path not the NF 6B signal path. It acts more broadly than just inhibition of IRF 3 transactivation and therefore may inhibit activation of a broad range of ISRE sequences on other genes. In this respect it is notable that in addition to an NF 6B site IRF 1 has a GAS which binds Stat1. It is reasonable to suggest that the ability of C10 to block IRF 1 gene expression both herein and in our studies of C10 inhibition of TNF induced VCAM 1 and leukocyte adhesion is related to its action on components of the TLR3 regulated IRF 3 IFN ISRE STAT signal path. In short C10 may be an example of an agent that meets the new therapeutic paradigm requested by Davendra and Eisenbath in their review D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 .

The NOD mouse is a prototypical example of type 1 diabetes. In experiments in a nonclean animal facility C10 was effective in retarding the development of glucosuria in the NOD mice Table 4 . When this was repeated in a clean laboratory no effect of C10 was noted. What was noted however was the onset of glucosuria in the mice was much earlier in the animals maintained in nonclean as opposed to clean mouse facilities Table 4 . Enteroviruses are associated with expression of Type 1 diabetes and there is a well described Coxsackie s virus mouse model of type 1 diabetes. We thus hypothesized that our results might be explained by viral induction of disease in the nonclean facility and we tested whether C10 was effective in the Coxsackie s virus induced NOD mouse model of diabetes. In experiments to test this hypothesis Table 4 C10 was effective in retarding glucosuria and death in this model. We thus can conclude that C10 as a representative lead compound of the MMI derivative tautomeric cyclic thione family can reverse a TLR3 TLR3 signaling disease in vivo and very likely can prevent it if disease expression is induced by environmental pathogens as in the Coxsackie model of diabetes in NOD mice. The MMI MMI derivative tautomeric cyclic thione family of drugs are likely to prevent both the initial insult and repeated insults during the lag phase. Further intermittent therapy may be useful to extend the life of the lag phase if not to totally prevent disease. This would be applicable to Hashimoto s autoimmune thyroiditis as well as Type 1 diabetes in humans since the NOD model is broadly used for evaluating mechanisms and therapies applicable to inducing an autoimmune inflammatory human disease and has been shown to be associated with iodide induced thyroiditis as well as Type I diabetes.

Table 4 shows the ability of C10 to attenuate Coxsackie virus induced Glucosuria in NOD mice. Mice were housed in germ free facilities termed clean or normal facilities where viral infections can occur termed dirty. Animals showing urine Tes Tape positivity greater than 1 are considered positive and to have diabetes L. S. Wicker et al. 35 855 60 1986 . In experiments in a dirty animal facility C10 was effective in retarding the development of glucosuria in the NOD mice. When this was repeated in a clean or germ free laboratory no effect of C10 was noted. What was noted however was the onset of glucosuria in the mice was much earlier in the animals maintained in dirty as opposed to clean mouse facilities. Further in experiments with 8 mice in each group even in a dirty facility the injection of CVB4 Edwards Coxsackie virus advanced the expression of glucosuria last two rows . These results suggest C10 inhibits environmental or virus induced expression of Type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible NOD mice.

In animals with diabetes glucosuria was confirmed by measuring blood levels viral titers in the pancreas were determined to be positive and insulinitis 2 to 4 was observed microscopically in diabetic but not C10 treated animals.

Induction of Diabetes and treatment with drugs. NOD Lt female mice were from the Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. . All experiments were carried out in accordance with Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals NIH Publication No. 85 23 revised 1985 . Mice were injected with 200 l PBS or 5 10PFU of the CVB4 Edwards Coxsackie virus strain ip D. V. Serreze et al. J Virol 79 1045 52 2005 . Mice were treated daily with i p injections of C 10 MMI 2.5 DMSO C10 carrier control or PBS MMI carrier control . After injections blood and urinary glucose levels were monitored weekly using Chemstrips Boehringer Mannheim . Consecutive values of 240 mg dl on two occasions 24 h apart were considered diagnostic of diabetes. Experiments used 8 mice group in up to 3 experiments.

Assessment of viral titer. Pancreases from euthanized mice were weighed placed in PBS minced sonicated and subjected to 3 freeze thaw cycles followed by a low speed centrifugation D. V. Serreze et al. J Virol 79 1045 52 2005 to isolate islets for analyses as above. Serial dilutions of the cleared lysates were made in PBS and 200 l aliquots added to 35 mm wells of confluent BSC40 cells American Type Culture Collection . After overlaying with 1 methylcellulose medium and incubation for 72 h at 37 C. the overlay was removed and monolayers fixed with methanol oxaloacetate then stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted and titers calculated as follows number of plaques volume of inoculate dilution factor.

Assessment of insulinitis. Pancreases were fixed in Bouin s solution and sectioned at three nonoverlapping levels D. V. Serreze et al. 79 1045 52 2005 . Granulated 13 cells were stained with aldehyde fuchsin and leukocytes stained with a hematoxylin and eosin counterstain. Islets at least 20 per mouse were scored as 0 no lesions 1 pen insular leukocytic aggregates and periductal infiltrates 2 25 islet destruction and 4 complete islet destruction. An insulitis score for each mouse was obtained by dividing the total score for each pancreas by the number of islets examined. Data were determined as mean insulitis scores i standard errors of the mean for the experimental groups.

phenyl methimazole protects mice from LPS induced endotoxic shock mediated by TLR4 signals and improves survival

The LPS that causes endotoxic shock binds to TLR 4 receptors on nonimmune cells monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells then activates two signal pathways S. Sato et al. 14 783 91 2002 MyD88 dependent M. Yamamoto et al. 169 6668 72 2002 T. Ogawa et al. 14 1325 32 2002 K. Ruckdeschel et al. 168 4601 11 2002 and MyD88 independent M. Yamamoto et al. 430 218 22 2004 Both pathways contribute to the fatal consequences of the syndrome. The MyD88 dependent pathway activate the NF B signal and MAP Kinase signal systems. After phosphorylation and degradation of I B and after the release of the p50 and p65 subunits from I B p50 and p60 enter the nucleus to interact with a multiplicity of gene promoters causing the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF IL 1 IL 6 and IL12 as well as the synthesis of the adhesion molecules ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 cytokines such as IFN and chemokines such as MCP 1 S. Uematsu et al. 168 5811 6 2002 K. A. Ryan et al. 72 2123 30 2004 . These gene products are only some of the mediators that contribute to the inflammatory syndrome in all organs to the acute systemic failure of all organs and to the hypotension hypothermia and shock. Additionally the MyD88 independent pathway activates the interferon regulatory factor IRF gene promoter IRF 3 which causes the up regulation synthesis and secretion of INF the activation of Stat1 the activation of a multiplicity of genes with ISREs Interferon sensitive response elements and increases in the expression of IRF 1 and the chemokine IP 10 V. Toshchakov et al. 9 169 75 2003 K. Hoshino et al. 14 1225 31 2002 T. Kawai et al. 167 5887 94 2001 K. A. Fitzgerald et al. 4 491 6 2003 K. Hoebe et al. 424 743 8 2003 D. D. Bannerman et al. 276 14924 14932 2001 . Thus both TLR4 and TLR4 adaptor molecules with their respective signals are involved in the toxic shock syndrome and the associated cellular inflammatory infiltration at the organ levels.

Methimazole MMI has been largely used for the treatment of Graves disease as well as in lupus eritematosus systemic D. S. Singer et al. 153 873 80 1994 E. Mozes et al. 32 19 21 1996 spontaneous autoimmune disease E. Mozes et al. 18 106 13 1998 and periocular inflammation in mice with experimental systemic lupus erythematosus C. C. Chan et al. 154 4830 5 1995 . The anti inflammatory property of MMI has been attributed to anti oxidant and immunomodulatory effects including effects on IFN signaling L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 2002 . A more potent methimazole derivative in the family of tautomeric cyclic thiones phenylmethimazole C10 or pMMI was developed based on its ability to suppress MHC gene expression L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 2002 but has now been shown to inhibit transcription of TNF increased venular cell adhesion molecule 1 VCAM 1 on human aortic endothelial cells HAEC and human umbilical venous endothelial cells HUVEC N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 . It was shown that C10 acts by inhibiting of TNF induced overexpression of interferon regulatory factor 1 IRF 1 gene not by inhibiting TNF activation of NF B promoter element on the VCAM 1 promoter N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 . IRF 1 binds to an element closer to the transcriptional start site on the VCAM 1 promoter than the NF B elements and is required for optimal TNF activation of the VCAM 1 promoter N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 .

Additionally phenylmethimazole C10 but not Methimazole MMI has been shown to suppress the inflammatory response and improve survival in DSS induced colitis by its down regulatory effects on TLR4 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells and by its effects to decrease pathologically expressed TLR4 signals including TNF IL 1 IL 6 interferon protein 10 IP 10 and VCAM 1 gene transcription L. D. Kohn et al. In press 2005 . In the following studies we focused on the ability of phenylmethimazole C10 or pMMI to reverse the pathologic signaling of the LPS induced TLR4 mediated toxic shock syndrome in a rodent and a horse model of endotoxic shock.

In studies of C57BL 6J mice injected with 20 mg kg LPS the mice developed a toxic shock syndrome hypotension hypothermia collapse between 6 and 12 hours post injection and were dead by 12 to 36 hours Table 5A . Phenylmethimazole C10 or pMMI protected the mice from death after LPS injection in 100 of animals examined Table 5A in this experiment and in 3 separate replicate experiments. This protection was due to CIO PMMI and not to the solvent used for C10 DMSO Table 5A . When clinical symptoms were checked 12 hours after LPS injection we observed that mice treated with pMMI or C10 showed mild symptoms i.e. mild decreases of body temperature but maintained normal feeding and drinking habits as well as mobility Table 5B . In stark contrast all other mice developed profound hypothermia hypotension and shock Table 5B . They were depressed hypothermic and stopped feeding and drinking Table 5B . Moreover all mice that developed severe shock died within 36 hours Table 5A and 5B .

Table 5. C10 dramatically increases viability and signs of shock in mice challenged with LPS. A C57BL 6J mice injected with 20 mg kg LPS develop symptoms of shock within 12 hours and die within 36 hours. 100 of C57BL 6J mice injected intra peritoneally i p with C10 1 mg kg 30 minutes before injection with LPS survive at 36 hours whereas all mice treated with methimazole MMI which is less effective than CO L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 2002 or prednisolone and flunixin of meglumine which are currently in use clinically to treat LPS shock in humans and animals respectively die. The mice treated with C10 survived for as long as they were observed 4 weeks . B Additionally mice treated with C10 had only a slight decrease in body temperature 12 hrs after LPS and no signs of shock. C C10 administered in daily doses of 0.1 or 1 mg kg 12 hours after challenge with LPS also results in 100 survival compared to 0 survival for control mice.

Even when we compared the effects of pMMI C10 with Methimazole MMI Predsnisolone PSL and Flunixin of Meglumine FM we observed that only pMMI C10 protected against shock Table 5B . Today prednisolone is commonly used as therapy in humans Flunixin of Meglumine is used as treatment in animals. Mice injected with LPS and treated with drugs other than C10 PMMI showed signs of shock at 12 hours and were dead within 36 hours post LPS injection. Table 5A and 5B a novel result with important clinical implications.

In these experiments C10 was administered 30 min before LPS injection at 1 mg kg. C10 0.1 to 1 mg kg administered 30 min to 12 hours after lethal LPS injection also survived in 100 of cases Table 5C . Some mild signs of shock such as hypothermia and slight hypotension did develop in these mice depending on the treatment time post LPS injection and the C10 dose 0.1 to 1 mg kg. Nevertheless taken together these results show that C10 can both protect from endotoxic shock and death in LPS induced endotoxic shock in mice and can reverse the toxic shock syndrome post LPS treatment in a dose dependent manner despite the onset of toxic shock symptoms and signs.

IRF 1 MCP 1 and IP 10 as well as downstream genes such as pro inflammatory cytokine genes COX genes and INOS are altered by LPS induced endotoxic shock in mice and reversed to normal levels by C10 PMMI in association with successful therapy.

Whereas the interferon inducible genes IRF 1 and IP 10 are the main reported inducible genes after LPS activation of the MyD88 independent IRF 3 IFN pathway MCP 1 is a gene activated primarily by the MyD88 dependent NF B linked pathway. Given the action of C10 to block the IRF 3 IFN Stat1 ISRE IRF 1 pathway but not the NF B path N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 and above we anticipated C10 would only inhibit IRF 1 and IP 10 and not MCP 1 in vivo. As illustrated however the over expression of all three of these genes was suppressed by C10 PMMI to normal levels in most organs . Thus LPS treatment profoundly increased IRF 1 RNA levels in most organs albeit less in liver and C10 PMMI reverted mRNA levels to those in normal tissues under normal conditions. IP 10 gene expression followed the IRF 1 pattern in all organs except in liver where IP 10 was expressed more than IRF 1. Similarly the MCP 1 pattern with LPS and LPS plus C10 pMMI replicated the profound ability of this agent to decrease RNA increases induced by LPS activation of the NF B pathway. In short C10 pMMI was an effective suppressor of LPS increased mRNA levels of genes reported to be important in both MyD88 independent and dependent pathways. Thus despite the in vitro evidence for primary pathway selectivity pathologic expression of genes downstream of both the TLR4 mediated NF B as well as the IRF 3 IFN signal paths were suppressed. It is suggested in the literature that the NF B activation of the MCP 1 can be the result of a delayed signal secondary to IFN activity. Also it is possible that there is pathway cross over in vivo in part because of mixed cell populations i.e. the presence of vascular endothelial cells in every tissue. In sum in vivo these data thus suggested that C10 inhibited expression of genes in the IRF 3 IFN inducible pathway and even possibly secondary IFN effects on the NF B pathway in vivo.

In order to more definitively determine if LPS induced IFN signaling and LPS induced increases in IRF 1 and IP 10 in vivo might be attenuated by an effect of C10 treatment on Stat1 activation protein phosphorylation levels of Stat1 in whole tissue lysates were examined in mice from Table 5. Both kidney and lung tissues displayed detectable levels of activated Stat1 protein measured using a specific antibody to phosphorylated phenylalanine 701 in mice treated with LPS plus control solvent DMSO and not protected from shock lanes 2 and 5 respectively by comparison to controls who were never exposed to exogenous LPS injections Lanes 1 and 4 . These levels were reduced to basal in mice which were protected from LPS induced shock by treatment with C10 lanes 3 and 6 kidney and lung respectively . In contrast neither LPS nor C10 had any effect on total Stat1 in these tissues bottom blots . These data establish that C10 inhibits Stat1 as well as IRF 1 gene expression in vivo in toxic shock. Based on literature studies described in immune cells and results we have described in nonimmune cells Tables 2 3 it is reasonable to state that C10 blocks Stat1 IRF 1 signals in vivo as well as in vitro this is important in the therapy of toxic shock where these genes are not only involved but critical to disease expression. C10 therapy is thus important in reducing pathologic changes in multiple tissues whose organ failure is known to contribute to the signs and symptoms of toxic shock.

The pro inflammatory cytokines TNF IL 1 IL 6 IL 12 and IFN are reported to be synthesized and secreted by the activation of the LPS TLR 4 MyD88 dependent pathway through NF B gene activation. These pro inflammatory cytokine genes as determined by histochemistry in multiple tissues from the animals in Table 5 were strongly increased by inducing endotoxic shock with LPS at 24 hours. Induction was suppressed however by C10 PMMI treatment. This was evidenced for IL 6 and TNF in all tissues examined by Northern analyses . In the case of IFN this phenomenon was true in most tissues examined . These results were additionally confirmed by determination of the cytokine concentrations in blood Table 6 . Thus using an ELISA technique many of the cytokine levels that were increased in LPS and LPS plus DMSO treated mice were elevated more than 1000 fold by comparison to control or C10 pMMI treated mice who received LPS Table 6 . Very clearly phenylmethimazole C10 PMMI reduced these cytokine levels to levels in normal control mice in association with efficacious effects on disease expression in toxic shock.

In sum C10 PMMI suppressed pro inflammatory cytokine production induced by the LPS TLR 4 MyD88 dependent and independent pathways in vivo consistent with its effects to prevent or reverse toxic shock Table 5 . The data are consistent with previous data in vitro that C10 PMMI down regulates the IRF3 IFN Stat1 ISRE IRF 1 signal transduction pathway N. Harii et al. Mol Endocrinol 19 1231 50 2005 N. M. Dagia et al. J Immunol 173 2041 9 2004 . However the data additionally suggest that in vivo in nonimmune organs with cell heterogeneity C10 PMMI also regulated genes linked to the NF B activation pathway possibly by a secondary effect on IFN autocrine paracrine effects on nonimmune cells rather than a direct block of the MyD88 linked signal system.

The cyclooxygenase COX enzyme system catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandins and regulates their tissue levels. Prostaglandins are well described as important in the induction of hypotension in endotoxic shock. COX 2 is over expressed in toxic shock and in autoimmune inflammatory diseases related to toxic shock as well as in cancer progression. It is responsible for catalyzing the formation of PGE2 which is the prostaglandin responsible for blood pressure decreases and hypotension in septic shock. In contrast to COX 2 COX 1 is the house keeping enzyme with a protective role. C10 selectively suppressed the expression of COX 2 which is increased in tissues by LPS induced endotoxic shock and increased COX 1 gene expression which is decreased in tissues by LPS induced endotoxic shock to the normal level. The ratio of COX 2 COX 1 is considered important both to disease expression and therapeutic efficacy.

Thus when expression of COX 1 and COX 2 RNA levels were evaluated by RT PCR in the organs of different groups of mice described in Table 5 the COX 1 RNA levels were down regulated in most examined organs of LPS treated mice except spleen and heart while the C10 returned RNA levels to the normal levels . These data indicate that C10 protects cells from damage induced by LPS since COX 1 is a protective enzyme in the inflammatory process. Moreover the absence of an LPS effect on spleen which is dominated by immune cells but a significant effect of LPS and C10 in lung kidney and liver indicates that the dominant increase and significant action of C10 was on the nonimmune cells in these tissues since they dominate those organs unlike the case in spleen.

In contrast to COX 1 the COX 2 RNA levels were up regulated in kidney liver lung spleen and heart of mice suffering from endotoxic shock establishing that all organs suffer a strong inflammatory process. Further elevated COX 2 RNA levels were completely suppressed and returned to normal by C10 in kidney liver and lung and also suppressed in spleen and heart albeit less dramatically. These data establish that C10 is a selective COX 2 inhibitor compared to COX 1 and acts as a more physiologic regulator by reversing both the increased COX 2 and decreased COX 1 toward normal levels. The changes in spleen indicate that the COX 2 enzyme changes in immune cells are an important component of disease expression in immune as well as nonimmune cells. Nevertheless the absence of COX 1 changes in the spleen emphasize that the LPS induced and C10 decreased COX 2 changes in nonimmune cells are also important in toxic shock and its effective therapy by C10.

INOS is only one of the several terminal mediators of shock and inflammation. The overproduction of nitric oxide NO in endotoxic shock has been well documented as it has been in autoimmune inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis. Similarly the tissue damage induced by peroxinitrites from multiple pathways is documented. The data show that iNOS mRNA gene expression is undetectable or poorly expressed as measured by RT PCR in normal tissue non treated mice . This gene is clearly induced by LPS in the organs of mice iNOS in spleen liver lung kidney heart . C10 suppressed iNOS RNA levels increased by LPS returning them toward normal. These data support the idea that C10 can ameliorate peroxinitrites formation and tissue damage induced in tissues by toxic shock and autoimmune inflammatory disorders.

IRF 1 regulates the expression of several genes involved in autoimmunity and inflammation. Genes regulated by IRF 1 include among others the Type 1 IFN cytokines IFN and IFN the type 2 IFNS IFN Interleukin 12 IL 12 and IL 15 as well as nitric oxide COX 2 MHC 1 and 2 microglobulins. Thus IRF 1 seems to be positioned at the intersection of multiple different downstream paths leading to a Th1 response and to host defense again microorganisms and environmental insults moreover it is critically positioned to affect TLR3 and TLR4 signals.

It is reasonable to presume from the sum of the data in and Tables 3 6 plus our previous work L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 April 2002 that C10 is a lead compound representative of a group of agents which blocks autoimmune inflammatory disease in vivo and that it acts by a critical effect on pathological increases in IRF 1 gene expression not evident in normal tissues. This has two important consequences. First because of the absence of high IRF 1 gene expression in normal tissues C10 pMMI will have no significant effect in normal tissues or normal individuals. Second pathologic increases in IRF 1 gene expression can be mediated by pathologic expression of TLR3 TLR4 in nonimmune tissues macrophages monocytes and dendritic cells. Thus C10 is a lead compound that blocks pathologic expression of multiple genes important in pathologic autoimmune inflammatory disorders by blocking the IRF 3 Type 1 IFN STAT ISRE IRF1 signal path. Further because of autocrine paracrine actions of type 1 IFNs which secondarily can increase NF B signaled genes or perhaps because of the cell heterogeneity of an organ and the different effects of C10 on different cells as the signals progress vascular vs nonvascular as will be evident below the C10 family of compounds can act in vivo to attenuate the NF B signaled increases in downstream genes or gene products. The bottom line is that C10 and its family members block the pathological innate immune response in nonimmune tissues that are associated with TLR4 as well as TLR3 associated autoimmune inflammatory disorders as evidenced for TLR4 associated diseases in the colitis and toxic shock models and in TLR3 mediated disease as evidenced for insulinitis and Type I diabetes model but likely in its related disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis.

Phenylmethimazole pMMI or C10 ameliorates the microvasculature damage decreases inflammatory cellular infiltration and decreases adhesion molecule expression on the vascular endothelial cells of tissues affected by endotoxic shock.

Decreases in inflammatory infiltrates The histo pathological observation of sections stained with H. E. from animals at 18 hours after LPS injection showed the inflammatory changes already described by other authors. These changes were evident on the microcirculation of the different tissues evaluated. In lung all these changes are usually most severe and both TLR3 and TLR4 related L. Guillot et al. 280 5571 80 and 279 2712 8 2004 . We thus evaluated the effect of C10 pMMI on the inflammatory changes induced by LPS in lung sections. In LPS treated mice the lumen of microvasculature was full of blood cells and there was an increased number of acute inflammatory cells due to the slowing of the blood flow seen at both 20 magnification and 40 magnification . Margination i.e. moving to the edge of the dynamic flow or movement process of granulocytes along the vascular endothelium and stacking on the vessel endothelia was more evident in the LPS group. In some animals where the histopathological picture was more severe microemboli in the lumina of small vessels was observed. The septa of alveoli are thicker than normal due to the infiltration and migration of acute inflammatory cells making them more dense in the pulmonary tissue of LPS treated mice. Microcirculatory damage as well as inflammatory cellular infiltration was ameliorated by C10 pMMI . In other organs where the inflammatory process induced by LPS was evident e.g liver heart or kidney the same results were found. Taken together these data indicated that the systemic inflammation induced by endotoxic shock was suppressed by C10 pMMI .

Adhesion molecules that are up regulated in the vascular endothelium of organs suffering from endotoxic shock are suppressed by C10 pMMI Sections from different organs were study by immunohistochemistry in order to evaluate the effect of pMMI on ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 adhesion molecules in endotoxic shock. Both ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 are the ligands for systemic inflammatory cells to bind to the endothelium and infiltrate tissues in septic shock. Moreover organ infiltration by inflammatory cells has been largely associated to the systemic organ failure. The data showed that ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 adhesion molecules were strongly up regulated in mice treated with LPS and suffering from endotoxic shock. ICAM 1 is over expressed in lung and liver. ICAM 1 specific staining on the endothelial cells of lung capillaries is decreased by C10 pMMI as well as in endothelial cells of vein and reticulooendothelial space of the liver. VCAM 1 is specifically up regulated in the large veins and C10 pMMI suppress the VCAM 1 levels.

These results thus showed that in mice injected with LPS ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 staining were clearly increased and stronger than in normal and C10 pMMI treated mice. The results were the same comparing results from C10 treated mice with results from LPS plus DMSO treated mice or those treated with LPS alone. These data showed that C10 p MMI suppressed both ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 over expression that is induced by LPS TLR4 activation on endothelial cells.

Experimental design In order to determine the survival curve of C57BL 6J mice they were injected intra peritoneally Up with different drugs and solvents See Table 7 below 30 minutes before LPS injection See . Twenty 20 mg Kg LPS from was then injected intra peritoneally i p into each mouse. The experiment was performed using at least 8 mice in each of 3 experiments. After LPS injection the survival curve was determined at 6 12 18 36 hours and 1 week. The result is expressed as a percentage of survival without LPS treatment.

Mice were evaluated 18 hours after the induction of endotoxic shock by intraperitoneal LPS injection. Samples were collected for mRNA isolation Histology and Immunohistochemistry see Scheme 1 . C10 pMMI effects on LPS TLR4 increased TNF IL 1 IL 6 IL 12 IFN COX 2 iNOs and MCP 1 gene expression were measured by Northern analysis and RT PCR in spleen lung liver heart and kidney. Results were confirmed by protein studies using ELISA and by immunohistochemistry. The LPS TLR4 MyD88 independent IFN signaled genes including IRF 1 IP 10 COX 2 and iNOS were similarly studied. The results of the gene and protein expression were correlated with histological studies. Tissues obtained at 18 hrs were also used to measure the systemic inflammatory response at the organ level. The expression of adhesion molecules ICAM 1 and VCAM 1 was correlated with immunohistochemistry markers of inflammation and TLR4 signaled changes. Lung was used as a reference organ for inflammatory histological studies and lung and liver for adhesion molecule studies.

Histology Tissue from liver lung kidney and heart from normal LPS and LPS plus C 10 treated mice experiment in Table 5 were fixed in 4 PBS formalin overnight. They then were dehydrated serially in alcohols 50 70 90 100 clarified in chloroform and embedded in paraffin. Five 5 sections were obtained and mounted on Vectabond Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame Calif. pretreated slides. The sections were incubated twice 10 minutes each in xylol and re hydrated by serial alcohol treatments 100 90 70 50 followed by distilled water. Tissues were stained with Hematoxylin Eosin using standard protocols mounted and observed by optical microscopy in a double blind manner.

Immunohistochemistry IHC C10 pMMI effects on the over expression of adhesion molecules induced by LPS were studied in different organs. These results focus lung and liver. At 18 h after LPS injection mice were sacrificed and the heart lung liver spleen and kidney were removed and fixed in 4 formalin in PBS. The tissue was then dehydrated in serial alcohols 50 v v twice 70 v v twice 80 v v twice 95 v v twice and 100 v v twice cleared in pure chloroform embedded in paraffin and sectioned 5 prm thickness and mounted on Vectabond Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame Calif. pre treated slides. The section were then cleared of paraffin by exposure to xylol twice 10 minutes each and rehydrated using serial alcohol treatments 100 90 70 50. After endogenous peroxidase inhibition with 3 HOin methanol and nonspecific protein blocking using 5 BSA Sigma Aldrich the tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4 C. with 5 ul ml of anti mouse VCAM 1 polyclonal goat IgG or 3 ul ml of anti mouse ICAM 1 extracellular domain specific goat IgG as primary antibodies R D System Inc. Minneapolis Minn. . The samples were extensively rinsed with PBS and subsequently incubated 1 hr with biotinylated anti goat IgG diluted 1 20 using the Goat Extravidin Staining Kit Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. . After extensive washing the sections were incubated with streptavidin peroxidase diluted 1 20 from the same kit. The sections were then washed three times and incubated 10 minutes with DAB Chromogen reagent Sigma Aldrich . The slides were washed and were subsequently counterstained with methyl green Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame Calif. then dehydrated in ethanol followed by pure xylene. Slides were mounted and examined under a light microscope at 40 Nikon Eclipse E600 .

Macrophages in animals treated with LPS display a rapid induction of many genes which are regulators of the inflammatory response M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 . Cultured murine macrophages themselves when treated with LPS also display a rapid induction of many genes which are regulators of the inflammatory response M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 . In order to obtain a more complete understanding of how C10 may be preventing endotoxic shock in our animal model we chose to examine the affect of C10 on LPS stimulated genes in cultured murine macrophages in particular the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. RAW 264.7 cells are a transformed functional macrophage cell line W. C. Raschke et al. 15 261 7 1978 . The RAW 264.7 cell line has been a common and well accepted tool in the scientific literature used to further understand the affects of LPS on macrophages V. Toshchakov et al. 9 169 75 2003 T. Horng et al. 2 835 41 2001 D. Schilling et al. 169 5874 80 2002 B. W. Jones et al. 60 Suppl 3 iii6 12 2001 .

We studied the expression profile of genes which were deemed relevant in the current body of literature. Thus we examined the effect of C10 on a multi functional and complex array of factors which included proinflammatory cytokines IFN IL 1 TNF IL 6 and IL 12 a CXC chemokine IP 10 an enzyme which catalyzes the production of nitric oxide iNOS and a transcription factor IRF 1 each of which have been reported to play a role in endotoxic shock M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 . Although the proinflammatory cytokines IL 1 TNF IL 6 and IL 12 can be directly or indirectly induced by LPS signaling through TLR4 M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 and certainly play a role in endotoxic shock N. C. Riedemann et al. 112 460 7 2003 a recent report identified IFN as a critical secondary effector which is induced upon LPS activation of TLR4 signaling and contributes to mortality in a murine septic shock model M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 . Due to evidence that IFN plays a critical role in the mortality of animals in the murine model of endotoxic shock M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 we examined the effects of C10 on LPS stimulation of IFN dependent mechanisms in greater detail.

LPS induced genes are down regulated in cultured mouse macrophages LPS can activate monocytes and macrophages to produce cytokines such as IFN IL 10 TNF IL 6 and IL 1.2 M. A. Dobrovolskaia et al. 4 903 14 2002 which act on either the macrophages monocytes themselves or other target cells to regulate the inflammatory process which occurs in septic shock. Upon stimulation with LPS macrophages can also produce CXC chemokines such as IP 10 which serve to further attract immune cells to a site of inflammation K. M. Kopydlowski et al. 163 1537 44 1999 . Macrophages stimulated with LPS can also produce nitric oxide NO as a result of expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme iNOS C. Bogdan 2 907 16 2001 .

Each of these factors that are considered to be important in the pathogenesis of septic shock are typically absent or found at extremely low levels in unstimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages as confirmed by northern analyses lane 1 or by RT PCR for iNOS see . Upon stimulation of mouse macrophages with LPS 1 ug mL for 1 3 or 6 hours northern blot analysis revealed an mRNA expression profile in the presence of C10 or the vehicle control DMSO for IFN IL 1 TNF IP 10 and IL 6 . In the case of each mRNA measured there was a difference between the DMSO lane and the C10 lane. This affect was less pronounced for TNF and may be attributed to the ability of LPS to increase TNF directly through the NF B signaling mechanism.

While northern blotting provides a reliable method for qualitative determination of gene expression levels a more quantitative and sensitive method was required to accurately determine the affect of C10 on LPS induced cytokine gene expression in macrophages. Real time polymerase chain reaction real time PCR was employed to obtain a quantitative profile of mRNA expression inhibition by C10. We measured IFN TNF IL 6 IL 1 and IL12p40 gene expression after 1 2 3 4.5 or 6 hour treatments with LPS 1 ug mL in the presence of DMSO control or C10 drug treatment . Gene expression levels were quantified by normalizing to an endogenous control GAPDH and normalizing to the untreated DMSO control which allowed the comparison of mRNA levels in C10 treated versus DMSO control treated LPS stimulated macrophages .

The fold decrease in induced IFN gene expression was most strongly decreased at the one hour time point 8 fold and was maintained at a low level throughout the time course . The reduction in the TNF increase induced by LPS was at a maximum at 3 hours 4 fold but showed no reduction at 1 or 6 hours when LPS increased TNF levels were low. The LPS induced increase in IL 6 was maximally reduced at the 3 hour time point at greater than a 16 fold reduction . LPS induced IL 1 was maximally decreased at 1 hour 11 fold . IL 12 p40 was not detectable until 4 to 5 hours but was strongly reduced at 6 hours 16 fold . Taken together these real time PCR data show that C10 effectively reduces the LPS dependant production of a broad range of proinflammatory cytokines in monocyte macrophages classically used to study LPS action.

In macrophages NO production occurs as a result of LPS induction of iNOS C. Bogdan 2 907 16 2001 and is a process that depends on autocrine signaling by IFN . We used standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the inhibition of LPS induced iNOS transcription in the presence of C10 . The RAW 264.7 cells were treated with LPS in the presence of C10 its vehicle control DMSO or another excipient vehicle compound B see Table 8 for 3 hours. Table 8 establishes that C10 is effective in vivo in the mouse toxic shock model and in FRTL 5 cell assays in vitro when solubilized in water in the presence of the compound B excipient i.e. water soluble forms of C10 are effective in both in vivo and in vitro just as C10 in DMSO. In the presence of DMSO control lane 4 or vehicle B only lane 5 little or no iNOS reduction was detected respectively when compared to LPS only lane 3 . Cells treated with C10 showed a strong reduction of LPS induced iNOS mRNA lanes 6 and 7 vs. lanes 4 and 5 . Because a modest affect was observed in the presence of DMSO control only lane 4 C10 was dissolved in another vehicle called Solution B which had no affect alone lane 5 . In sum C10 had a strong inhibitory effect on iNOS RNA levels regardless of the vehicle used to dissolve the compound.

Table 8 shows that C10 in excipient is as good as C10 in DMSO in vitro and in vivo. In the studies described in Table 5 C10 was formulated in DMSO and administered i.p. DMSO was used due to the low solubility of C10 in aqueous environments but can have well documented independent effects M. S. Ivanovic et al. 147 153 159 2004 . In addition C10 solubilized in DMSO and diluted to a working concentration is not stable for prolonged periods of time. To circumvent these issues we used a proprietary cyclodextrin CD excipient that is approved by the FDA for use in humans to make an aqueous formulation of C10. C10 stored in the aqueous preparation for 6 weeks prior to use was equally effective in decreasing TLR3 and IFN mRNA levels in thyrocytes by comparison to solutions with DMSO. In a test using LPS induced toxic shock oral excipient solubilized C10 stored in diluted form at 4 C. for 8 weeks was as effective in preventing death as was freshly made C10 i.p. in DMSO at the same 1 mg kg dose. Solutions of C10 diluted in DMSO and stored in diluted form at either 4 C. or 70 C. were inactive in vitro or in vivo.

A cyclohexamide treatment was done CHX to confirm that new protein synthesis is required for the LPS induction of iNOS mRNA and support that Type 1 interferon signaling might be responsible for the increase in iNOS rather than direct effects of TLR4 signaling. Effectively we considered whether C10 might be acting via a mechanism that required new protein synthesis i.e. the synthesis of IFN . This is the case as shown by a loss of LPS increased iNOS equivalent to that of C10 in the presence of cyclohexamide CHX We have already seen that C10 can reduce the LPS induced transcription of IFN mRNA and B . Previous reports have found that LPS induction of iNOS in mouse macrophages can occur via binding of autocrine IFN to its receptor and subsequent Stat1 activation D. Schilling et al. 169 5874 80 2002 .

C10 inhibits the LPS induced activation of Stat1 in cultured macrophages The important role of type i interferons in LPS induced septic shock was recently demonstrated in mouse models M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 . We have already shown in that LPS induced increases of IFN a type I interferon mRNA levels are strongly inhibited by C10. It is has been shown that binding of IFN to the type I interferon receptor results in phosphorylation of Stat1 as a key component for the transduction of a signal to the nucleus to induce expression of iNOS and IP 10 in the mouse macrophage Y. Ohmori et al. 69 598 604 2001 . C10 was able to reduce the level of LPS induced Stat1 phosphorylation in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions lanes 5 and 9 . No apparent affect was observed with the DMSO control only lanes 4 and 8 . The cyclohexamide control lane 10 indicates that LPS induced Stat1 phosphorylation requires new protein synthesis presumably IFN V. Toshchakov et al. 9 169 75 2003 . C10 had a similar affect as cyclohexamide lanes 9 vs. 10 indicating that C10 may be acting as an inhibitor of IFN synthesis as well. When the data in showing reduced IFN mRNA and protein are taken in combination with the data in showing reduced Stat I phosphorylation the following hypothesis can be stated. C10 can reduce signal transduction through the IFN signal pathway by reducing the LPS induced autocrine paracrine action of IFN thereby decreasing Stat1 activation.

C10 down regulates IRF 1 and IRF 1 DNA binding in LPS treated macrophages IRF 1 is a transcription factor which is induced upon LPS stimulation of macrophages through a Stat1 dependent mechanism Y. Ohmori et al. 69 598 604 2001 . Therefore IRF 1 provides another example of a response that may be affected by an inhibitor of LPS induced IFN signaling. Unlike other molecules studied thus far IRF 1 acts as a transcription factor to directly bind to DNA to enhance transcription of other genes such as iNOS R. Kamijo et al. 263 1612 5 1994 . In macrophages treated with LPS IRF 1 is required for the transcriptional control of the iNOS gene R. Kamijo et al. 263 1612 5 1994 . Macrophages were treated with LPS 1 ug mL for 1 2 or 3 hours and longer in the presence of C10 a DMSO control or a commercially available derivative of C10 MMI . Typical LPS induction for each time point is observed in each LPS plus DMSO lane lanes 2 5 8 . LPS increased IRF 1 RNA is small at 1 hr but becomes maximal by 3 in the presence of DMSO the C10 solvent lane 8 . A strong reduction in LPS increased IRF 1 mRNA is still observed upon treatment with C10 at 2 and 3 hours lanes 6 and 9 vs 5 and 8 respectively . The decrease by C10 is much greater than by MMI lanes 6 and 9 vs 7 and 10 respectively .

In order for IRF 1 to enhance gene transcription it must bind to cis DNA elements located on the target gene. iNOS is an example of a target gene that contains an IRF 1 cis binding element R. Kamijo et al. 263 1612 5 1994 . Several other IRF 1 target genes exist such as the interferon inducible MX gene which codes for the antiviral Mx protein D. Damino et al. 13 454 60 2001 . The MX promoter has been shown to contain strong IRF 1 binding elements C. E. Grant et al. 28 4790 9 2000 . We used the Mx ISRE IRF 1 binding site and EMSA to measure the effect of C10 on LPS induced IRF 1 binding to the MxISRE element.

Two complexes were induced upon LPS stimulation 1 ug mL for 2 hours when compared to untreated lanes 2 5 and 8 vs 1 . A dose dependent reduction was observed in samples from both C10 lanes 3 and 4 and MMI lanes 6 and 7 treated cells. Specificity was observed upon incubation of extracts with unlabeled MxISRE probe lane 9 . Complexes were identified using super shift studies in which nuclear extract was incubated with antibody directed toward either IRF 1 or IRF 3 lanes 11 and 12 respectively . When incubated with IRF 1 antibody there was an observed supershift identifying that complex as an IRF 1 containing complex lane 11 No supershift was observed using two different IRF 3 antibodies lane 12 Ab 1 the Ab 2 data are not shown indicating no IRF 3 in the complex. Interestingly when the extracts were preincubated with unlabeled probe against the human IFN IRF 1 binding element which acts as a competitive inhibitor the IRF 1 complex was also eliminated lane 10 . These last data indicated that LPS induced IRF 1 in these extracts would also bind to the human IFN IRF 1 binding element.

Relevance to Endotoxic Shock in Example 3 Endotoxic Shock Protected Mice Have Reduced Tissue Levels of Activated Stat1

It was recently demonstrated that Stat1 null animals show an approximately 50 enhanced survival rate when challenged with a lethal dose of LPS M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 . In the same study IFN null mice which were challenged with a lethal LPS dose showed a 100 enhancement of survival M. Karaghiosoff et al. 4 471 7 2003 . Therefore blocking parts of the IFN signal pathway is not as effective as blocking the pathway completely i.e. by preventing the ligand receptor interaction or blocking the initial signal induced by the ligand receptor interaction. In order to determine if LPS induced IFN signaling in vivo might be attenuated by C10 treatment we examined protein phosphorylation levels of Stat1 in whole tissue lysates from mice in the experiments of Table 5. Both kidney and lung tissues as well as mouse macrophages displayed detectable levels of activated Stat1 protein in mice which were not protected from shock lanes 2 and 5 respectively these levels were reduced to basal in mice which were protected from LPS induced shock by treatment with C10 lanes 3 and 6 respectively .

In summary these data in RAW 264.7 indicate that C10 has a strong inhibitory effect on multiple factors that have been shown to be involved in endotoxic shock. These data are important to understand the mechanisms of C10 protection in the murine model of endotoxic shock. C10 appears to be suppressing the induction of very early genes such as IFN and IL 1 whose induction is a direct result of LPS dependent TLR4 signaling. TNF is also rapidly induced by direct TLR4 signaling however the effect of C10 on TNF is negligible at 1 hour indicating that C10 does not affect all aspects of TLR 4 signaling equally. This is particularly interesting to contrast with the in vivo data of Example 3. Thus in vivo C10 did decrease TNF RNA levels and protein but it seemed possible this reflected a secondary action through IFN or the possibility that multiple interacting cell types were affected by the C10 primary action on nonimmune cells. It is nevertheless evident that LPS induced IFN is an attractive therapeutic target due to its multiple down stream affects which stem from the activation of Stat1 which is required in macrophages for the transcriptional upregulation of IRF 1 iNOS and IP 10. The Stat1 reduction in the macrophages and in nonimmune cells in tissues can partially explain the reduction of the genes in the mouse tissues of Example 3.

Studies in mice can be argued to be nonrelevant to humans. Often large animals with more close phylogenetic relationships to humans and with diseases similar to those in humans are desired as experimental models. Endotoxemia in horses is one such model of endotoxic shock in humans. Endotoxemia in horses is caused by the biological consequences of endotoxins in blood. Endotoxins are structural components of the walls of gram negative bacteria the main representative molecule being lipopolysaccharide LPS . LPS can be released from the gut to its surrounding environment i.e. the peritoneal cavity and bloodstream. Once LPS reaches either it can interact with mononuclear phagocytic cells. This interaction increases the sensitivity of those cells to endotoxins by 1000 fold and induces an excessive response of an inflammatory cascade including activation of arachidonic acid activation of the TLR4 signal pathway and activation of a coagulation cascade. The end result is the production of pro inflammatory mediators with development of circulatory shock e.g. TNF .

The TNF synthesis and release mediated through the TLR4 signal is associated with the synthesis of other inflammatory mediators including Interleukins 1 IL 1 Interleukin 6 IL 6 prostaglandins and tissue factors such as acute phase protein D. D. Morris 5 167 81 1991 D. L. Hawkins et al. 66 1 10 1998 H. Kato et al. 48 221 31 1995 . Serum concentration of IL 6 activity begins to increase approximately 1 hour after serum TNF and peaks between 3 to 6 hours after onset of endotoxemia. IL 6 and IL 1 mediate the endotoxin induced febrile response and are responsible for the inflammatory cascade which constitutes the acute phase response.

Superoxide radicals can react with endogenous nitric oxide NO resulting in the production of peroxynitrite anions which are potent oxidizing agents C. Gonzalez et al. 186 150 6 1992 B. Zingarelli et al. 120 259 67 1997 C. Gagnon et al. 431 107 10 1998 . Additionally nitric oxide is a well known mediator of endotoxic shock tissue injury in animal and human A. Petros et al. 28 34 9 1994 P. Wang et al. 129 1137 43 1994 J. A. Avontuur et al. 76 418 25 1995 C. Szabo et al. 253 233 8 1993 C. Szabo 851 422 5 1998 . LPS is a potent inducer of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS P. P. Wolkow 47 152 66 1998 which catalyzes the synthesis of large amounts of NO and peroxynitrite which among other factors are responsible for the late phase of hypotension vasospasm cellular suffocation apoptosis lactic acidosis and multi organ failure in endotoxic shock in horses as well as another animals and humans P. P. Wolkow 47 152 66 1998 . Indeed experimental and clinical use of NOS inhibitors which do not differentiate clearly between constitutive endothelial NOS ceNOS and iNOS prevents LPS induced hypotension P. P. Wolkow 47 152 66 1998 .

The intestinal lumen of the horse usually contains large amount of endotoxins. It has been estimated that ceacum and ventral colon of a normal horse contains more than 2 grams of endotoxin which is restricted to the intestinal lumen by an efficient mucosal barrier. Thus any pathology that damages the mucosal barrier will allow the endotoxins to reach the peritoneal cavity and the blood D. D. Morris 5 167 81 1991 J. N. Moore et al. 45 330 2 1981 D. Chakravortty et al. 43 527 33 1999 J. Drabkova 42 102 5 1992 . Consequently horses with ischemic intestines experience the deleterious effects of endotoxins before surgery and several days after the ischemic intestine has been removed. The most common clinical findings in affected animals include alteration in mucous membrane color with the presence of a toxic line prolongation of the capillary refill time increased heart and respiratory rates reduced borborygmi fever hemoconcentration neutropenia collapse and abdominal pain.

Using a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease and colitis as well as endotoxic shock C 10 exhibited suppressive action on interferon inducibles genes IP 10 IRF 1 and MCP 1 a multiplicity of pro inflammatory cytokine genes TNF IL 1 IL 6 as well as IRF 1 dependent genes COX 2 iNOS .

C 10 inhibits IFN and IRF 1 gene expression and or secretion in vitro in multiple cell systems thyrocytes macrophages human aortic vascular endothelial cells and in vivo in mouse models of colitis and toxic shock. Further our results in mice showed Table 5 that mice were 100 protected against LPS induced toxic shock and death when C10 was administered as one single dose before LPS injection. In Example 3 C 10 was able to inhibit pro inflammatory cytokines adhesion molecules chemoattractant proteins IRF 1 IFN iNOS and COX 2 in the target organs as well as circulating inflammatory mediators in the LPS treated animals associated with the signs and symptoms of endotoxic shock i.e. the hypotension multi systemic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Based on the foregoing data and background we examined the ability of C 10 to act as an effective therapeutic i on toxic shock in a LPS induced horse model of endotoxic shock and ii in a horse model of peritonitis induced either by injecting foreign endotoxin laden caecal material from the gut into the peritoneal cavity or by abdominal operative procedures to correct lesions causing peritonitis.

Establishment of clinical parameters of endotoxemia in horses We classified endotoxemia clinically based on analyses of symptoms and signs in the LPS treated group. Further we took into account symptoms at different stages early symptoms the collapse or shock stage and the normalization stage. In the early stage of endotoxemia 0 15 0 30 to 1 00 hr after LPS injection we observed abundant sweating excitation weak muscular tone abdominal pain diarrhea with watery deposits. We also observed nasal discharge significant respiratory distress dyspnea increased respiratory rate tachypnea and increased cardiac rate tachycardia . The pulse was weak and undetectable and the capillary refill time increased. Thirty 30 minutes after endotoxin injection all horses showed progressive decreases in blood pressure until the animal developed a systolic pressure under 100 mmHg and a diastolic pressure under 70 mmHg. At this time all horses became hypotensive and hypoxemic with strong cyanosis. The increase of capillary refill time reached a peak but was still significant during the time of circulatory shock from 1 to 6 hours.

Oxygen saturation in blood sPO was decreased coincident with the shock causing the mucosal membranes to become strongly cyanotic total collapse followed shortly. At the time of shock the digestive system was characterized by suppression of borborygmi suppression of intestinal ileocecal activity abdominal pain colic intestinal obstruction strangulation and alteration of the mucosal barrier. Temperature increased at 6 hours and was normalized at 24 hours.

Laboratory studies detected hyperglycemia at 3 hours that was normalized at 24 hours. Leucopenia developed at 3 hours and normalized at 6 hours. Creatinine and urea in the blood were increased several fold at 24 hours and normalized at 1 week post LPS inoculation. These results showed that endotoxic shock induced transient acute renal failure. An increased red cell concentration was measured likely due to the loss of water from blood and its presence as edema in some organs.

Finally 24 hours after LPS injection there was normalization of the blood pressure and normal sPO although mucosal membranes remained hyperemic and cyanotic suggesting that hypoxemia and tissue perfusion had not recovered.

These changes are illustrated in Tables 9 13 which show effects of LPS to cause increased respiratory distress diarrhea and collapse as well as the ability of C10 to prevent these very nearly in entirety.

As shown in Tables 9 and 10 C10 protects horses from Endotoxic shock induced by LPS. Horses were treated with a sub lethal dose of LPS 10 g kg after pretreatment with pure DMSO 10 ml or C10 2 mg kg dissolved in 10 ml pure DMSO injected intravenously iv . Horses with LPS developed toxic shock over a 24 hour period with hypotension hypothermia tachypnea rapid pulse abnormal cardiograms and finally collapse whereas C10 treated animals had none of these changes. The results in Tables 9 and 10 are from a typical experiment with LPS or LPS DMSO vs. LPS C10 treated animals studied at early time points and up to 24 hrs with 1 week follow up wherein cardiovascular parameters of circulatory shock were measured toxemia congestion and cyanosis.

The ability of C10 to protect horses from Endotoxic shock induced by LPS is also evidenced in Tables 11 and 12. Horses were treated with a sub lethal dose of LPS 10 g kg after pretreatment with pure DMSO 10 ml or C10 2 mg kg in 10 ml pure DMSO injected iv. Horses with LPS developed toxic shock over a 24 hour period with decreased blood pressure hypothermia rapid respiration rapid pulse abnormal cardiograms and ultimately collapse whereas C10 treated animals had none of these changes. Tables 11 and 12 depict a typical experiment comparing LPS or LPS DMSO vs. LPS C10 treated animals studied at early time points and up to 24 hrs with 1 week follow up wherein fluid in the lungs was measured by auscultation as well as tachypnea and dyspnea. They demonstrate that C10 suppresses the signs of pulmonary distress suffered during toxic shock.

As seen in Table 13 C10 also protects horses from Endotoxic shock induced by LPS as measured by abdominal pain diarrhea increased number of stools and collapse or prostration to a lying rather than standing state. Horses were treated with a sublethal dose of LPS 10 g kg after pretreatment with 10 ml of pure DMSO or C10 1 mg kg in 10 ml of pure DMSO injected iv. Horses with LPS developed toxic shock over a 24 hour period with decreased blood pressure hypothermia rapid respiration rapid pulse abnormal cardiograms and total prostration or collapse whereas C10 treated animals had none of these changes. Table 13 depicts typical LPS or LPS DMSO vs. LPS C10 treated animals studied at early time points and up to 24 hrs with 1 week follow up wherein abdominal pain watery diarrhea number of stools and collapse to a lying state vs. normal gastrointestinal function and disposition were measured. The severe abdominal pain diarrhea and increased frequency of stools were evident in a typical LPS or LPS DMSO treated animal by 3 hours as was the collapse and shock response of LPS treated animals. None of this occurred in animals treated with LPS plus C10. These data are representative of all animals in each group.

Phenylmethimazole C10 protects horses form LPS induced endotoxemia and endotoxic shock In sum C 10 clearly blocked symptoms of endotoxemia including hypotension and hypoxemia as well as endotoxic shock collapse cardiac anoxia acute renal failure and loses of water from blood in all respects Tables 9 13 . In contrast the DMSO vehicle had no protection from hypotension hypoxemia shock collapse and organ failure after endotoxin LPS inoculation Tables 9 13 .

Phenylmethimazole C10 protects horses form peritonitis induced endotoxemia and endotoxic shock C10 protected horses from endotoxic shock and death by septic peritonitis induced by intestinal fluid. After intestinal caecal fluid was inoculated intraperitoneally into normal horses the animals rapidly exhibited clear symptoms of endotoxemia presumably because the fluid had free endotoxin. C10 protected in the first stage of endotoxemia due to free lipopolysaccharide present in the intestinal lumen Table 14 . Clinical evaluation of the animal at 0 30 1 3 6 showed clinical signs of endotoxemia in non C10 treated animal but not in the C10 treated animal that were clinically protected from endotoxemia.

At 12 hours all animals began to develop clinical peritonitis with abdominal pain and fever Table 14 . At this time all animals started to be treated with antibiotics penicillin streptomycin in order to avoid clinical progression of the bacterial infection and further release of LPS by bacterial death. At 12 hours one group of two animals was inoculated with C10 2 mg kg given intravenously in a bolus whereas two other horses remained without treatment i.e. only with antibiotics. At 24 hours the non C10 treated animals were dead Table 14 whereas those animals treated with C10 survived with only a slight depression and mild signs of endotoxemia Table 14 . After the C 10 bolus the animals immediately got better ate and drank water. Signs of any collapse or depression disappeared within 15 minutes. The survivors showed no signs of organ failure at 24 hours or even 1 week after the end of the experiment Table 14 showing that C 10 protected from organ failure respiratory distress acute renal failure hypotension cardiac anoxia and hypoxemia .

As shown in Table 14 C10 protects horses from death after peritonitis induced by intraperitoneal injection of intestinal Caecal fluid. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with 100 ml of caecal fluid containing bacteria and free endotoxin. One group received an intravenous dose of 2 mg kg C10 in 10 ml of 100 DMSO 30 min. before caecal fluid injection the other group got 10 ml of 100 DMSO alone 30 min. before caecal fluid injection. Between the time of caecal fluid injection and 12 hours post injection C10 treated animals had minimal symptoms of endotoxemia by comparison to DMSO control animals. At 12 hours all animals began to exhibit signs of peritonitis. Horses treated with antibiotics only and who had progressive signs of peritonitis developed toxic shock over a 24 hour period with decreased blood pressure hypothermia rapid respiration rapid pulse abnormal cardiograms and collapse whereas C10 treated animals had none of these changes. Animals pretreated with C10 received a second dose of 2 mg kg C10 in 10 ml of 100 DMSO at 12 hours whereas the other group got 10 ml of 100 DMSO alone. Both groups were also given therapeutic doses of penicillin and streptomycin at 12 hours. Animal plus C10 were walking and eating within 24 hours and had a full recovery in all cases whereas the others developed toxic shock in all cases and died. This experiment combines several groups of two horses in each group. These results indicate C10 is effective to prevent toxic shock in horses subjected to peritonitis and endotoxic shock. The treatment was 100 effective in 10 animals so treated and was effective even in repeat treatment of the same animals.

Effect of Phenylmethimazole C10 on horses subjected to operative procedures to repair necrotic bowels A group of animals were also subjected to an operative procedure that clamped vessels in a small portion of bowel. Within 2 days bowel necrosis and peritonitis ensued. At that point animals were re operated to remove the necrotic bowel and treated with 2 mg kg C10 or DMSO alone pre op and post op for three days. Animals treated with C10 were walking and eating within 24 hours and had full recovery in all cases whereas those without C10 developed toxic shock in most cases were severely ill and died. Both groups had the same antibiotic therapy as used above. These results indicate C10 is effective to prevent toxic shock in horses subjected to surgical procedures or endotoxin administration.

In sum endotoxemia and endotoxic shock are the leading causes of death in horses being intimately related to the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disorders that cause colic and neonatal foal septicemia. Phenylmethimazole C10 is a methimazole derivative and lead compound of a family of tautomeric cyclic thione drugs that block pathologic activation of TLR3 TLR4 signaling in nonimmune tissues monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells. They suppress the expression type I interferon genes e.g. INF interferon inducible genes IP 10 IRF 1 pro inflammatory cytokines TNF IL 1 IL 6 chemokines such as MCP 1 COX 2 and iNOS. Endotoxemia and endotoxic shock in horses are associated by the up regulation of several mediators COX 2 dependent mediators such as prostaglandins TNF IL 1 IL 6 and iNOS. The Endotoxic shock survival rate is strongly dependent on type I interferon transcription genes in knock out rodent models. Using an endotoxemia horse model we carried out clinical studies showing that phenylmethimazole C10 protects horses from clinical signs of endotoxemia and endotoxic shock induced by lipopolysaccharide hypotension hypoxemia tachypnea tachycardia hypoxemia respiratory distress abdominal pain and colic watery diarrhea intestinal hypomotility and anus relaxation acute renal failure hyperglycemia and circulatory shock or collapse. When we induced endotoxemia and shock due to septic peritonitis using intraperitoneal inoculation of intestinal flora the C10 survival rate was 100 compared with 0 of survival in non treated animal.

Endotoxemia protection experiment In order to determine the effect of C 10 on experimental endotoxemia induced by LPS we used 3 groups of horses. In Group 1 LPS group horses were injected with 10 g kg of 055 LPS from Sigma St. Louis by intravenous bolus injection as recommended by others J. N. Moore et al. 13 95 8 1981 G. E. Burrows 40 991 8 1979 . Group 2 horses LPS DMSO were injected with the same dose of vehicle 100 DMSO and the effect of DMSO alone was analyzed. Group 3 LPS C 10 horses were injected with LPS plus 100 DMSO used as the vehicle. Horses from the different groups were studied clinically at different time points. In the groups LPS C 10 and LPS DMSO C 10 and DMSO were injected 30 minutes before LPS.

Time 0 was defined as a normal horse before injection of LPS. After LPS injection we evaluated the animals at 15 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 3 hours 6 hours 24 hours and 1 week. We evaluated changes in the following biological systems targeted by LPS cardiovascular circulatory abdominal and pulmonary. Time of capillary flow integrity of the vessels and other vessel alterations were evaluated clinically. Maximum venous blood pressure NIBP max. minimum venous blood pressure NIBP min. electrocardiogram ECG and oxygen saturation in blood PsO expressed by were determined using a Cardell Monitor 9403. Study of normal abdominal intestinal activity ileocecal sphincter activity number of depositions stools and their characteristic diarrhea as well as anus muscular tone were also evaluated clinically. Respiratory rate dyspnea pulmonary auscultation presence of fluid in the respiratory tract and pulmonary congestion were evaluated clinically. Glucose GOT glutamic oxalacetic transaminase enzyme GPT glutamic pyruvate transaminase enzyme creatinine urea hemogram hemoglobin Hb hematocrit Ht red cell number PMN number neutrophils eosinophils basophils monocyte number and lymphocyte number were determined at different time points. Clinical observations were recorded by skilled veterinarians who were unaware of which animal received C10 i.e. results were evaluated in a blinded fashion.

Endotoxic shock survival experiments The ceacum and ventral colon of normal horses contain more than 2 g of free endotoxin as well as gram negative bacteria which are restricted to the intestinal lumen by an intact intestinal barrier. The pathologies that damage the mucosal barrier allow the endotoxins to reach the peritoneal cavity as well as the blood. To evaluate the protective effect of C 10 on horse endotoxic shock survival rate we injected 100 ml of ceacum fluid intraperitoneally to induce peritonitis and endotoxic shock. Ceacal fluid was extracted from horse under anesthesia. The group of horses that were inoculated intraperitoneally with intestinal fluid developed clinical peritonitis and symptoms of endotoxemia 12 hours after intraperitoneal fluid inoculation.

All animals were treated with therapeutic doses of penicillin and streptomycin. One group of horses was inoculated with same dose of ceacal fluid and also treated with antibiotic 12 hours after fluid inoculation but received C 10 2 mg kg 30 minutes before and 12 hours after the injection of caecal fluid. We evaluated survival at 0 15 30 minutes 1 3 6 12 18 and 24 hours as well as 1 week later.

Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease of the circulation involving abnormal TLR4 expression and signaling causing increases in genes downstream such as VCAM 1. Increased VCAM 1 on vascular endothelial cells is important to attract leukocytes to the inflammatory region. Atherosclerosis is more advanced in patients with diabetes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The epidemic of obesity is associated with the epidemic of cardiovascular complications broadly considered as atherosclerosis complications myocardial infarcts strokes etc. A drug that might attenuate the inflammatory response has been suggested as potentially effective by TLR4 knockouts. This does not eliminate lesions because the damaging insult hyperlipidemia remains. The oxidized lipids can be construed as environmental signature molecules that elicit inflammation when they penetrate the endothelial layer. An important point however to recall is that lesions can be selective located primarily in one or another vascular bed. Further they may be influenced by the inflammatory response that causes swelling of the vessel wall and diminished size of the lumen. That decrease in lumen plus leukocyte platelet binding which further decreases the lumenal opening results in occlusive disease.

A critical component of many physiological and pathological inflammatory processes is thus the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium in the fluid dynamic environment of the circulation. Leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium occurs through a cascade of adhesive events involving tethering i.e. attachment to the endothelium from the free stream rolling on the apical surface of the endothelium cessation of rolling termed arrest spreading to more pleomorphic shapes and migration between adjacent endothelial cells to reach the extravascular space. This adhesion cascade is mediated in part by non covalent bonds that form between molecules present on the surface of the leukocyte ligands such as integrins and cognate molecules present on the surface of the endothelium receptors e.g. E selectin ICAM 1 VCAM 1 .

The endothelial receptors for the leukocyte ligands are commonly referred to as endothelial cell adhesion molecules ECAMs . Certain ECAMs known to play a role in leukocyte recruitment are increased at sites of pathological inflammation. For example VCAM 1 is present in a localized fashion on aortic endothelium that overlies early foam cell lesions in atherosclerosis. The increased expression of ECAMs mediates in part the selective recruitment of leukocytes to a site of inflammation T. A. Springer 76 301 314 1994 . The up regulated expression of ECAMs at sites of pathological inflammation contributes to aberrant leukocyte adhesion and infiltration of tissue that is a key component of inflammation and disease progression and or tissue damage e.g VCAM 1 is up regulated at sites of developing and developed atherosclerotic lesions M. I. Cybulsky et al. Science 251 788 791 1991 and participates in monocyte adhesion to the endothelium during atherogenesis F. W. Luscinskas et al. 125 1417 27 1994 C. L. Ramos et al. 84 1237 44 1999 . Thus a promising therapeutic approach for treating pathological inflammation is to reduce aberrant leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium via suppression of ECAMs J. Panes et al. 126 537 550 1999 .

ECAM expression is regulated at the gene level by the activity of transcription factors. Pro inflammatory cytokine e.g. TNF treatment of endothelial cells stimulates the activity of certain transcription factors e.g. NF B M. J. May et al. 19 80 88 1998 and also induces the expression of other transcription factors e.g. IRF 1 A. S Neish et al. 15 2558 2569 1995 . The active induced transcription factors ligate to their respective binding sites leading to ECAM gene transcription and ultimately protein expression. Several therapeutics for pathological inflammation work at least in part by modulating the activity of transcription factors E. M. Conner et al. 282 1615 1622 1997 J. W. Pierce et al. 156 3961 3969 1996 C. Weber et al. 91 1914 1917 1995 J. W. Pierce et al. 272 21096 21103 1997 M. Umetani et al. 272 370 4 2000 . Indeed compounds that block cytokine induced ECAM expression at the transcription level have been shown to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium J. W. Pierce et al. 156 3961 3969 1996 N. M. Dagia et al. 285 C813 C822 2003 C. Weber et al. 91 1914 1917 1995 J. W. Pierce et al. 272 21096 21103 1997 and to reduce inflammation in animal models E. M. Conner et al. 282 1615 1622 1997 J. W. Pierce et al. 272 21096 21103 1997 .

Phenyl methimazole C10 could potentially serve this purpose N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 . C10 i inhibits monocytic cell adhesion to cytokine inflamed human aortic endothelial cells HAEC under in vitro flow conditions that mimic conditions present in vivo ii strongly inhibits cytokine induced HAEC expression of VCAM 1 via suppression of the transcription factor IRF 1 and not NF B iii has a more modest effect on E selectin expression and iv has very little effect on ICAM 1 expression. While several other transcription inhibitors are known very few if any have been shown to selectively suppress VCAM 1 to act via IRF 1 and to inhibit monocytic cell adhesion to cytokine inflamed endothelium under fluid shear. Use of C10 in atherosclerosis is thus a reasonable consideration.

Previous work with the Apolipoprotein E deficient ApoE mouse a well accepted model of human atherosclerosis revealed that VCAM 1 is present on endothelium at lesion prone sites as early as 5 weeks and developed lesions Y. Nakashima et al. 18 842 51 1998 . Elegant studies by Ley s group C. L. Ramos et al. 84 1237 44 1999 demonstrated that monocytes exhibit greatly increased adhesion to carotid arteries isolated from ApoE mice compared to carotid arteries isolated from wild type mice. This increased adhesion is mediated in part by VCAM 1 C. L. Ramos et al. 84 1237 44 1999 M. Kobayashi et al. 111 1297 308 2003 . Michelsen et al. K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 found that mice deficient in TLR4 had a significant reduction in aortic plaque development in atherosclerosis prone apolipoprotein E deficient ApoE mice suggesting an important role for TLR4 in atherosclerosis.

The well accepted ApoE murine model Y. Nakashima et al. 18 842 51 1998 was our animal model of atherosclerosis. In initial experiments these mice were fed a high fat diet and received injections of C10 intraperitoneally every other day or orally every other day. Mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks and lesions characterized including VCAM 1 and TLR4 expression in accord with literature based studies Y. Nakashima et al. 18 842 51 1998 . The heart aorta and carotid artery were removed for gross microscopic and molecular analyses. This included determination of lesion size and sectioning of tissue with subsequent staining for presence and cell localization of ECAMs and TLR4 at the protein level as well as assessment of leukocyte macrophage infiltration. Results from mice treated with C10 were compared to controls to determine if C10 has a statistical effect on lesions in the carotid arteries.

C10 reduced vascular inflammation in ApoE mice fed a high fat diet C10 was given i.p. 1 mg kg every other day to mice for 8 weeks. Control mice received DMSO alone. Mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks and histopathology examined in different tissues as determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. In sections from the base of the aorta in C10 treated Panel A and untreated mice Panel B are presented as well as sections of the coronary artery vasculature in C10 treated Panel C and untreated mice Panel D . Vessels in the myocardium were also compared in C10 treated and untreated mice. In Panel B the arrows show that the severity of the lesions in the base of the aorta is markedly greater in untreated mice by comparison to C10 treated mice Panel A . Similarly in Panel D the picture is representative of long sections of the coronary arteries that were nearly fully occluded with plaque in untreated mice whereas in C10 treated mice Panel C coronary arteries were largely unobstructed. Further even where lesions were evident the lumens of vessels remained patent. Vessels within the myocardium were obstructed by plaque in the absence of C10 but patent and nearly free of plaque in the mice treated with C10. Data are representative of multiple slides taken from multiple animals.

When lesions were qualitatively evaluated C10 reduced disease severity and progression Table 15 in association with decreases in TLR4 mediated inflammatory markers Table 15 .

As shown in Table 15 atherosclerotic lesions are decreased in C10 treated mice. Sections of the coronary arteries and myocardium as well as the base of the aorta were compared in untreated mice vs. C10 treated mice both for extent of lesion quality of lesion overexpressed TLR4 overexpressed VCAM 1 and extent of inflammation and plaque. Lesions and observations were qualitatively evaluated using for severe to for very mild. C10 treated animals were clearly improved. The results indicated that C10 decreased the widespread inflammatory response wherein TLR4 positive cells abound and there are macrophages infiltrating the area. Evaluation was double blinded.

The ApoE model in mice is representative of changes in human atherosclerotic plaques. Atherosclerotic lesions in human tissues are associated with overexpressed TLR4 and VCAM 1. Sections of the coronary arteries from surgically removed plaques were immunstained with anti TLR4 Bottom Right Panel anti VCAM 1 Top Right Panel anti ICAM 1 Bottom Left Panel in sequential slices from the paraffin imbedded block. An H E stain Top Left Panel shows the occluded vessel with a foam cell lipid laden plaque surrounded by a muscle wall and myocardial tissue. VCAM 1 dark grey color is overexpressed in the lesion but also in the endothelial layer opposite the lesion area. TLR4 dark grey color is more expressed in the area opposite the lesion and surprisingly throughout the smooth muscle layer surrounding the vessel particularly opposite the plaque. TLR4 is also expressed in the myocardial musculature. The expression suggests a widespread inflammatory response wherein TLR4 positive cells abound be they macrophages infiltrating the area or other cells. In all respects these data duplicate those in the ApoE mice and thus should be like the lesions in the ApoE mice Table 15 sensitive to C10 therapy.

C10 decreases IFN induction of phosphorylation of Stat1 and the activation of IRF 1 in human aortic endothelial cells HAEC To evaluate vascular endothelial cells directly we used human aortic endothelial cells in culture. Fundamental to C10 action in vivo appeared to be its ability to inhibit the IRF 3 IFN Stat 1 IRF 1 signal pathway in vitro. Thus IFN induction of IRF 1 protein was decreased by C10 bottom lanes 4 vs lane 2 and was not mimicked by the vehicle alone DMSO or D in lane 3 . In the same blot stripped and reprobed for an activated form of Stat1 phosphorylated at Y701 there was also a decrease of IFN induced Stat1 phosphorylation top lanes 4 vs lane 2 and was not mimicked by the vehicle alone DMSO or D in lane 3 .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 is one requirement for its activation of downstream genes tyrosine phosphorylation is important in the dimerization process necessary for Stat binding to promoter elements on sensitive genes. Another requirement is serine phosphorylation which contributes to full Stat1 transcriptional activation. To evaluate effects on serine phosphorylation of Stat1 the following experiments were performed i Rat thyrocytes FRTL 5 were infected lane 2 or not lane 1 with Influenza A virus for 24 hours and then treated with either DMSO 1 lane 3 or 1 mM C10 lane 4 ii Human aortic endothelial cells HAEC were incubated with 100 U mL of hIFN Biosource Camarillo Calif. for 2 hours in the presence of either DMSO 1 lane 5 or 1 mM C10 lane 6 and iii mouse macrophages RAW 264.7 were incubated for 3 hours with LPS serotype 0111 B4 Sigma Milwaukee Wis. at a concentration of 500 ng mL either alone FIG. B lane 7 or in the presence of DMSO 0.5 lane 8 or 0.5 mM C10 lane 9 . As can be seen in IFN given with vehicle control DMSO also increases serine phosphorylation in HAEC lane 5 and this is decreased by C10 lane 6 . The effect of C10 to reduce pathologically induced serine phosphorylation of Stat1 is not limited to HAEC but is also seen in FRTL 5 cells lane 4 vs lanes 2 and 3 and RAW cells lane 9 vs lanes 7 and 8 . Additionally it is not limited to pathologic induction by IFN lane 6 vs 5 but also is effective in pathologic induction mimicked with FluA infection lane 4 vs lanes 2 and 3 and by pathologic induction mimicked by treatment of cells with LPS lane 9 vs lanes 7 and 8 . In sum C10 is a inhibitor of IRF 3 IFN Stat IRF 1 ISRE activation pathways and blocks pathologically increased effects on Stat1 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation induced by TLR3 TLR4 pathologic signals in nonimmune cells monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells.

Compound 10 is an effective agent in a mouse model of atherosclerosis even given every other day and evaluated 8 weeks after insult onset high fat feeding . However it is also effective at earlier time points. Thus when we compared the effect of C10 on mice at 4 weeks given both orally and ip there were significant effects on weight. This strain of mice is the same as used in obese animal studies related to the rapid onset of Type 2 diabetes M. Fujimoto et al. 54 1340 8 2005 . In this regard chronic inflammation has been postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and linked to overexpression of iNOS M. Fujimoto et al. 54 1340 8 2005 . C10 decreased weight gain evident before the 4 week time period and also reduced the inflammatory TLR4 mediated response.

Experimental animals Twenty female Apo E mice Jackson Laboratory 5 weeks old and weighing 14.5 g average weight were divided in 4 groups 1 animals treated with 10 DMSO 2 animals treated orally with C 10 in DMSO 1 mg kg body weight 3 animals treated I P with C 10 in DMSO same dose and 4 control animals without treatment.

The treatment was done every other day 8 week expt or every day. The animals were fed on a Western type diet TD 88137 from Harlan Teklan . The experiment was terminated after 4 or 8 weeks.

Tissue preparation At the end of the experiment the animals were anesthetized by IP injection of Avertin 0.1 ml 5 g of body weight. In situ perfusion fixation was performed with PBS for 10 min followed by PBS 4 formaldehyde at 37 C. Heart and aorta were removed the arch thoracic and abdominal portions of the aorta were dissected and the surrounding tissues were carefully removed. The tissues were post fixed by immersion in PBS 4 formaldehyde over night at 4 C. Tissue samples were then washed 10 minutes with PBS after dehydration they were embedded in paraffin and sectioned 7 m thick . Sections were stained with Hematoxylin eosin and examined under a light microscope.

Immunoblot analysis in HAEC To determine if C10 blocks IFN mediated activation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in HAEC we treated confluent HAEC with 1000 ml IFN in the absence or presence of C10 1.0 mM 0.25 DMSO carrier control for C10 for 2 hours. Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer 150 mM NaCl 1 IGE PAL CA 630 and 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture PMSF leupeptin and pepstatin A . Twenty five g of lysate was resolved on 3 8 Tri Acetate PAGE gels under denaturing conditions using the NuPAGE Bis Tris System Invitrogen Life Technologies Carlsbad Calif. then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were probed first with rabbit anti human IRF 1 H 205 Ab sc 13041 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz Calif. membranes were then stripped and reprobed with rabbit anti human phospho Stat 1 Tyr 701 Ab 9171 Cell Signaling Technology Beverly Mass. for detection of activated Stat1. Binding of secondary HRP conjugated goat anti rabbit Ab sc 2054 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz Calif. was detected using the ECLplus Western Blotting Detection System Amersham Biosciences Piscataway N.J. .

The affect of C10 on Stat1 serine phosphorylation at residue 727 was observed by Western blot using a phosphoserine specific Stat1 antibody Biosource Camarillo Calif. . Three different cell types were stimulated as follows i Rat thyrocytes FRTL 5 were infected with Influenza A virus for 24 hours and then treated with either DMSO 1 or 1 mM C10. ii Human aortic endothelial cells HAEC were incubated with 100 U mL of hIFN Biosource Camarillo Calif. for 2 hours in the presence of either DMSO 1 or 1 mM C10 iii Mouse macrophages RAW 264.7 were incubated for 3 hours with LPS serotype 0111 B4 Sigma Milwaukee Wis. at a concentration of 500 ng mL either alone or in the presence of DMSO 0.5 or 0.5 mM C10. Twenty five g of each whole cell lysate was resolved by SDS PAGE blotted on nitrocellulose membranes then probed with the indicated antibodies. Loading was controlled by stripping and re probing with an antibody directed against non phosphorylated Stat1 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz Calif. .

We have demonstrated that phenylmethimazole C10 a lead compound of the methimazole methimazole derivative tautomeric cyclic thione family is effective to reduce pathologic TLR3 TLR4 overexpression and or signaling in nonimmune cells monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells. We have demonstrated this both in vitro and in vivo and shown this action has efficacy in diseases representative of each Type 1 diabetes TLR3 and Endotoxic shock colitis and atherosclerosis TLR4 . We have demonstrated efficacy not only in mice but also in horses afflicted with a disease mimicking a human disease state. By analogy this drug should be effective in any disease with pathologic TLR expression and signaling causing autoimmune inflammatory diseases.

We demonstrate that nonimmune cells as well as macrophages in continuous culture express basal levels of TLR3 or TLR4 that the TLR3 or TLR4 are functional and that their activation causes increases or decreases in genes and gene products of two signal paths which have been linked to TLR3 or TLR4 signaling via its MyD88 and or its TRIF adaptor protein i the NF B and ERK1 2 MAPK path reputed to emanate from TRAF6 interactions and ii the IRF 3 and IFN signal path. These observations are relevant not only to mouse or rat cells FRTL 5 thyrocytes RAW macrophages but human as well HAEC NPA thyrocytes HUVEC . The C10 effect is shown to be applicable to multiple pathologic stimuli from infectious agents to dsRNA and to noxious environmental insults such as hyperlipidemias linked to overeating high lipid containing diets.

We have demonstrated that TLR3 4 overexpression and signaling with its downstream cytokine mediated inflammatory response can be blocked by C10 and this family of compounds in vitro and in vivo. We show that disease caused by transfection by dsRNA mimics infection by a virus Influenza A which is a single strand RNA virus whose replication and activity after infection is likely to be mimicked by the dsRNA transfection. Reports in pancreatic cell systems associated with insulinitis and diabetes as well as lung epithelial cells associated with pulmonary autoimmune inflammatory disorders also link virus infection dsRNA transfection and TLR3 overexpression indicating this phenomenon and the action of C10 is applicable to nonimmune cells in multiple tissues.

We show that TLR3 and IFN protein are expressed in situ in thyrocytes from patients with Hashimoto s thyroiditis which are surrounded by immune cells but not in thyrocytes from normal individuals or Graves autoimmune hyperthyroidism a novel finding never previously demonstrated. The results from human thyrocytes in culture indicate that TLR3 activation and increases can occur in a human as well as rat thyrocyte in culture and this can occur in the absence of lymphocytes or a lymphocyte produced IFN since lymphocytes primarily produce type II interferon 63 . The results thus raise the possibility that thyrocytes are affected by a primary insult that activates the TLR3 system to produce an innate immune response mimicking that of a dendritic cell. The resultant cytokine and co stimulatory molecule changes in the thyrocyte may then contribute to attracting lymphocytes to the gland since unlike dendritic cells the thyrocytes cannot migrate to the lymphoid organ.

The results in thyrocytes are startlingly similar to studies of another disease with TLR3 involvement and overexpression a role for pathogen induction and dsRNA involvement of a Type 1 IFN as an apparent autocrine paracrine factor immune cell infiltrates and cell specific destruction causing hypofunction insulinitis and type 1 diabetes D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 . Wen et al. L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 show that dsRNA could induce insulinitis and type I diabetes in animals consistent with the known animal model wherein Coxsackie virus induces Type 1 diabetes in NOD mice. Devendra and Eisenbarth D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 emphasize human relevance and note that enteroviruses have been the focus of many research studies as a potential agent in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. They note that the mechanism of viral infection leading to cell destruction involves IFN a Type I IFN like IFN . They hypothesize that activation of TLR by double stranded RNA or Poly IC a viral mimic through induction of IFN may activate or accelerate immune mediated cell destruction. They note that numerous clinical case reports have associated IFN therapy with autoimmune diseases thyroiditis in particular see below and that elevated serum IFN levels have been associated with Type 1 diabetes as well as thyroid autoimmune inflammatory disease M. F. Prummel et al. 13 547 51 2003 . Taken together with data in the present report the possibility is raised of an important mechanistic association relevant to disease pathogenesis. Hashimoto s and Type 1 diabetes may have immune cell infiltrates and destructive thyrocyte or cell changes because of a primary insult to the specific tissue cell that activates TLR3 and an innate immune response in the tissue cells this may be an early event in the pathogenic mechanism D. Devendra et al. Clin Immunol 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 .

Devendra and Eisenbarth suggest D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 that therapeutic agents targeting IFN over production or activity may potentially be beneficial in the prevention of type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity. We show a better effect would be suppression of the TLR signaling event increasing the type 1 IFN rather than a partial action on type 1 IFN only. Thus we had asked whether TLR3 overexpression signaling might be sensitive to the immunomodulatory actions of methimazole MMI or its more potent derivative phenylmethimazole C10 M. Saji et al. 75 871 8 1992 V. Montani et al. 139 290 302 1998 L. D. Kohn et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 365 616 2002 E. Mozes et al. 261 91 3 19.93 D. S. Singer et al. 153 873 80 1994 and show that C10 to a significantly greater extent than MMI blocks overexpression of TLR TLR signaling by inhibition of the TLR3 regulated IRF 3 IFN ISRE STAT signal path not the TLR MyD88 coupled NF 6B signal path. It acts more broadly than just inhibition of IRF 3 transactivation and therefore may inhibit activation of a broad range of ISRE sequences on other genes. In this respect it is notable that in addition to an NF 6B site IRF 1 has a GAS which binds Stat1. It is reasonable to suggest that the ability of C10 to block IRF 1 gene expression both herein and in our studies of C10 inhibition of TNF .A inverted. induced VCAM 1 and leukocyte adhesion is related to its action on components of the TLR3 regulated IRF 3 IFN ISRE STAT signal path. In short C10 may be an example of an agent that meets the new therapeutic paradigm requested by Davendra and Eisenbath in their review D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 not by its effect solely on Type 1 IFN but by blocking the entire TLR3 4 mediated signal path involving IRF 3 IRF 3 IFN ISRE STAT signal signaling. We show C10 is particularly effective since it can block tyrosine and serine phosphorylation important both in Stat1 dimerization and full transcriptional activation respectively. It is recognized that these different phosphorylation events can effect gene activation differently emphasizing the selectivity of C10 along with its inability to directly inhibit NF B signaling. The activation of NF B signaled genes is a normal process controlling many genes in the absence of a disease state. Super activation of the IRF 3 IFN ISRE STAT signal for example by VAK kinases is a pathologic event induced for example by viral infection. It is this that C10 inhibits. IRF 1 is normally not expressed is increased only in pathologic states and is effectively blocked by C10 therapy.

TLR signaling remains complex with many unknowns. The role of PI3 kinase and Akt involvement in phosphorylation of IRF 3 has recently emerged S. N. Sarkar et al. 11 1060 7 2004 full phosphorylation of IRF 3 requires TBK 1 and Akt. Reactive oxygen species involvement in virus induced activation of STATs is recognized T. Liu et al. 279 2461 9 2004 . The P38alphaMap kinase pathway is important in downstream effectors that participate in Type I IFN dependent gene transcription and involvement Y. Li et al. J Biol Chem 279 970 9 2004 . Transcriptional activation of the IFN gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing transcription factors ATF 2 c Jun IRF 3 IRF 7 NF B and HMGI Y D. Panne et al. Embo J 23 4384 93 2004 and thus indicates the two signal paths are intertwined both at the earliest level of IRF 3 IFN activation as well as at downstream molecules such as VCAM 1 gene expression. Nevertheless our data are important mechanistic steps and demonstrate at the very least C10 is a novel agent both to help dissect the complexity of the TLR3 4 signal pathway but more importantly to treat autoimmune inflammatory diseases induced by pathologic TLR3 TLR4 expression and signaling in nonimmune cells macrophages monocytes and dendritic cells.

Our previous description of C10 efficacy in inhibiting TNF induced VCAM 1 gene expression and leukocyte adhesion is highly relevant to atherosclerosis and colitis two other diseases where TLR4 overexpression or signaling in nonimmune cells is linked to autoimmune inflammatory disease K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 N. M. Dagia et al. 173 2041 9 2004 C. Fiocchi 273 G769 75 1997 N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 .

It is reasonable to conclude that Hashimoto s may therefore not only be grouped with insulinitis and Type 1 diabetes but also with colitis and atherosclerosis as autoimmune inflammatory diseases associated with TLR3 4 overexpression and signaling in nonimmune cells whose overexpression involves induction by molecular signatures of environmental pathogens K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 B. Beutler 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 C. Fiocchi 273 G769 75 1997 N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 .

The DSS model is used to study ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease. Recent work indicates that TLR4 is strongly up regulated in both E. Cario et al. 68 7010 7 2000 and that enterocolitis in another mouse enterocolitis model is significantly improved in TLR4 deficient mice. These data indicate the importance of innate immunity and TLR4 in Th1 dependent enterocolitis M. Kobayashi et al. 111 1297 308 2003 and thus the importance of C10 in blocking TLR4 overexpression in vitro and in vivo in colonic epithelial cells in the DSS model.

Without wishing to be bound be theory in any way herein it is reasonable to speculate that Hashimoto s and Type 1 diabetes may be prototypes of each other and that studies in FRTL 5 thyrocytes are a relevant model for studies in pancreatic p islet cells and diabetes. High glucose levels can transcriptionally increase MHC I expression and amplify interferon action in FRTL 5 thyroid cells G. Napolitano et al. 143 1008 17 2002 . In retrospect this is applicable to the islet cell changes induced by high glucose levels.

We N. Harii et al. 19 1231 50 2005 as well as others K. S. Michelsen et al. 101 10679 84 2004 G. Pasterkamp et al. 34 328 34 2004 D. Devendra et al. 111 225 33 2004 L. Wen et al. 172 3173 80 2004 G. Andonegui et al. 111 1011 1020 2003 B. Beutler Nature 430 257 63 2004 K. S. Michelsen et al. 173 5901 7 2004 C. Fiocchi 273 G769 75 1997 L. Guillot et al. 279 2712 8 2004 show that Type I IFN IFN or is an important factor in the innate viral immune response. We suggest an increase in Type I IFN gene expression in nonimmune cells can result in an autocrine paracrine manner to further upregulate TLR3 by activation of IRFs. Type I IFNs act as potent extracellular mediators of host defense and homeostasis and lead to the synthesis of proteins that mediate antiviral growth inhibitory and immunomodulatory responses. The secreted Type I IFN can sensitize the same or adjacent cells to dsRNA or dsDNA by increasing expression of dsRNA recognition molecules such as TLR3 and PKR or dsDNA recognition by PKR. A similar model invoking TLR3 and Type I IFN in the innate immune response of nonimmune cells has been invoked in Influenza A infected lung tissue L. Guillot et al. 279 2712 8 2004 .

Because it is a protective cytokine Type I IFNs have been used in the clinical setting to treat hepatitis C and B chronic myelogenous leukemias melanoma and renal cancer C. E. Samuel 14 778 809 2001 . One side effect of Type I IFN therapy is however a higher incidence of autoimmune disease. The risk of Hashimoto s thyroiditis is increased with type I IFN treatment in HCV hepatitis patients. Thyroid auto antibodies are found in up to 20 of patients who receive treatment with type I IFNs and approximately 5 of these patients develop clinical hypothyroidism P. Burman et al. 63 1086 90 1986 H. Gisslinger et al. 90 363 7 1992 A. Imagawa et al. 80 922 6 1995 . Consistent with the possible autoimmune inducing activity of type I IFNs upregulation of Type I IFNs was observed in some patients with psoriasis systemic lupus erythematosus and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus P. Schmid et al. 14 229 34 1994 X. Huang et al. 44 658 64 1995 A. A. Bengtsson et al. Lupus 9 664 71 2000 L. Farkas et al. 159 237 43 2001 . Thus C10 therapy supplants that of Type I Interferon since the latter is only a partial therapy that can cause as well as cure disease whereas C10 methimazole methimazole derivatives and tautomeric cyclic thiones offer a means to block total pathologic expression of the autoimmune inflammatory response.

Several last points are worth noting. The dsRNA transfection was used to activate PKR dependent NF B activation or a separate kinase system leading to IFN gene expression through IRF 3 activation. The upstream mechanism resulting in IRF 3 activation following dsRNA transfection or viral infection in vitro has been clarified. Pharmacological and molecular studies suggested that a novel viral activated serine threonine kinase VAK instead of PKR might activate IRF 3 in response to cytosolic dsRNA M. J. Servant et al. 276 355 63 2001 M. J. Servant et al. 22 49 58 2002 M. J. Servant et al. 278 9441 7 2003 . We now know this is a complex phenomenon involving P13 kinase Akt and 16B related kinases IKK IKKepsilon TANK binding kinase 1 TBK1 M. J. Servant et al. 276 355 63 2001 M. J. Servant et al. 22 49 58 2002 M. J. Servant et al. 278 9441 7 2003 . Consistent with these observations PKR mice are physically normal and the induction of type I IFNs by Poly I C and virus is unimpaired despite the evidence that PKR is a major intracellular RNA recognition molecule leading to an anti viral cellular response.

Second the sum of data suggests that the presence of TLR3 TLR4 upregulation and signaling by dsRNA transfection or LPS can account for the data in our previous study K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 which showed that viral infection plasmid transfection transfection of dsDNA or transfection of dsRNA into the cytoplasm of the cell could increase expression of MHC class I cause aberrant expression of MHC class II and cause the expression of other genes necessary for antigen presentation APC generation . The action of the dsRNA or dsDNA transfection appeared to involve NF B activation but only the dsRNA transfection increased IFN RNA levels K. Suzuki et al. 96 2285 90 1999 . These phenomena were evidenced in other cells including monocytes and macrophages and were associated with an immune inflammatory response in animals K. J. Ishii et al. 167 2602 7 2001 . C10 by blocking the TLR signal events blocks these downstream epiphenomena.

Last the C10 family is effective on nonimmune cells macrophages monocytes and dendritic cells but has been shown to be minimally active on other immune cells. Further the C10 family is restrictive in its action on the IRF 3 Type 1 IFN STAT ISRE IRF 1 signal its effect on direct activities of the NF B signal system is minimal. If IRF 1 is not expressed in the normal cell but only induced after pathologic induction i.e. by virus infection LPS dsRNA transfection or noxious environmental insult this family of compounds is clearly selective in affecting only pathologic overexpression leading to disease and not normal host immune defenses. They appear to be selective agents.

In sum these last four points emphasize the novelty and usefulness of the present invention. They defy current thoughts regarding therapy directed at immune cells by instead attacking nonimmune cell events. They defy current concepts of attacking genes causing disease susceptibility as the sole true therapeutic approach but rather attacks the common set of inciting environmental events even in genetically susceptible animals. They can thus prevent by blocking recurrent environmental events both as causative agents Type 1 diabetes Hashimoto s toxic shock and also remediate complications in chronic recurrent diseases such as colitis and atherosclerosis.
