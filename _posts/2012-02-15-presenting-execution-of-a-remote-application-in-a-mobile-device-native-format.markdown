There is a growing demand for mobile computing devices such as tablet computers and cellular telephones. Often a user would prefer to carry such mobile computing devices without carrying larger devices such as laptop computers. In some scenarios a user may use a mobile device in tandem with other devices such as laptop and or desktop computers. However these mobile computing devices are typically not configured with the same applications as a desktop or laptop computer. Therefore certain resources that may otherwise be manipulated using a desktop or laptop computer may be unavailable to mobile computing devices.

In general this disclosure describes techniques for a mobile device to access resources maintained by a second computing device generally referred to herein as a remote computing device such as a desktop computer workstation laptop or other computer. The mobile device generally corresponds to a mobile computing device such as a tablet computer a smartphone or other such device. The second computing device may for example be located within a work office or home office of a user. In general a user uses both the remote computing device and the mobile device to access the resources. In some cases the second computing device may be considered the primary device for accessing certain resources such as resources stored locally on the second computing device or within an enterprise server or cloud storage associated with the second computing device. When the user is in a location including the remote computing device such as a home office or work office the user interacts with the resources using the remote computing device. At other times when the user is away from the remote computing device the remote computing device is considered remote to the mobile device. Nevertheless the user may use the mobile device to access the resources maintained by the remote computing device in accordance with the techniques of this disclosure.

In some examples in accordance with the techniques of this disclosure the remote computing device is configured to generate context information that adaptively controls a presentation of the resources on the mobile computing device. For example the remote computing device may maintain statistics regarding frequency or patterns of access of certain resources in particular contexts. The remote computing device may maintain such statistics both when the user accesses the resources using the remote computing device itself as well as when the user accesses the resources using the mobile device. For example the remote computing device may maintain statistics related to how often particular resources are accessed times of day at which particular resources are accessed whether two or more resources are frequently accessed together whether certain resources are accessed at particular geographic locations more frequently than others or other such statistics. Accordingly the remote computing device may use these statistics to determine which of the resources are most likely to be accessed in a particular context. Subsequently when the mobile device initiates access to the resources via the remote computing device the remote computing device may provide information to the mobile device to cause the mobile device to display representations e.g. icons or links of the resources determined to be most likely to be accessed in the current context. In this manner the mobile device may provide one touch access to the user s resources using native user interface features provided by the mobile computing device.

The mobile device may be configured with executable software applications specific to the mobile device for some of the resources. However when the mobile device does not have an application for accessing one of the resources the mobile device may cause the remote computing device to execute an application to access that resource. The mobile device may further be configured to present execution of the application by the remote computing device in a mobile device specific format. For example rather than displaying a windowed graphical user interface the mobile device may ensure that the application is displayed in full screen mode such that window tools e.g. minimize and close buttons are hidden. Likewise the mobile device may receive mobile device specific input commands such as pinch zoom gestures rotations or the like and translate such commands for the application executed by the remote computing device. Moreover the mobile device may be configured to display user interface elements for one or more applications executed by the remote computing device even when the remote computing device does not display such user interface elements.

In one example a method includes comparing current values for one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between accesses to resources maintained by a remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions during the accesses determining one or more of the resources maintained by the remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed based on the comparison and causing a mobile device to obtain information indicative of the determined one or more resources based on the determination that the one or more resources have the high probability of being accessed.

In another example a device includes one or more processors configured to compare current values for one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between accesses to resources maintained by a remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions during the accesses and to determine one or more of the resources maintained by the remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed based on the comparison and a network interface configured to cause a mobile device to obtain information indicative of the determined one or more resources based on the determination that the one or more resources have the high probability of being accessed. The device may comprise the mobile device or the remote computing device.

In another example a system includes a remote computing device configured to maintain resources and to maintain data indicative of relationships between accesses to the resources and values for one or more context dimensions during the accesses and a mobile device configured to obtain information indicative of one or more of the resources that have a high probability of being accessed by the mobile device based on a comparison of current values for the one or more context dimensions to the data indicative of the relationships.

In another example a computer readable storage medium includes e.g. is encoded with instructions that upon execution cause a processor to compare current values for one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between accesses to resources maintained by a remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions during the accesses determine one or more of the resources maintained by the remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed based on the comparison and cause a mobile device to obtain information indicative of the determined one or more resources based on the determination that the one or more resources have the high probability of being accessed.

In another example a method includes issuing by a mobile device a request to access a resource maintained by a remote computing device wherein the request causes the remote computing device to execute an application to access the resource receiving information corresponding to graphical output resulting from execution of the application to access the resource from the remote computing device wherein the graphical output corresponds to a format specific to the remote computing device presenting a graphical representation of the received information in an output format optimized for the mobile device receiving an input command in an input format specific to the mobile device wherein the input command comprises a command for interacting with the application translating the input command to a format specific to the application executed by the remote computing device and sending the translated command to the remote computing device.

In another example a mobile device includes one or more user interfaces for receiving input from a user a network interface for communicating with a remote computing device and one or more processors configured to issue via the network interface a request to access a resource maintained by the remote computing device wherein the request causes the remote computing device to execute an application to access the resource receive via the network interface information corresponding to graphical output resulting from execution of the application to access the resource from the remote computing device wherein the graphical output corresponds to a format specific to the remote computing device present a graphical representation of the received information in an output format optimized for the mobile device receive an input command via one of the user interfaces in an input format specific to the mobile device wherein the input command comprises a command for interacting with the application translate the input command to a format specific to the application executed by the remote computing device and send via the network interface the translated command to the remote computing device.

In another example a system includes a remote computing device configured to maintain one or more resources and to execute applications for accessing the resources and a mobile device configured to issue a request to access one of the resources maintained by the remote computing device wherein the request causes the remote computing device to execute one of the applications to access the resource receive information corresponding to graphical output resulting from execution of the one of the applications to access the resource from the remote computing device wherein the graphical output corresponds to a format specific to the remote computing device present a graphical representation of the received information in an output format optimized for the mobile device receive an input command in an input format specific to the mobile device wherein the input command comprises a command for interacting with the one of the applications translate the input command to a format specific to the one of the applications executed by the remote computing device and send the translated command to the remote computing device wherein the remote computing device is configured to perform the translated command during execution of the one of the applications.

In another example a computer readable storage medium includes instructions that when executed cause a processor of a mobile device to issue a request to access a resource maintained by a remote computing device wherein the request causes the remote computing device to execute an application to access the resource receive information corresponding to graphical output resulting from execution of the application to access the resource from the remote computing device wherein the graphical output corresponds to a format specific to the remote computing device present a graphical representation of the received information in an output format optimized for the mobile device receive an input command in an input format specific to the mobile device wherein the input command comprises a command for interacting with the application translate the input command to a format specific to the application executed by the remote computing device and send the translated command to the remote computing device.

The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In general resources such as electronic documents files software applications and services of a modern enterprise are spread across many servers and personal computers which may be referred to as data silos. In general these devices are referred to as remote computing devices in this disclosure. The techniques of this disclosure allow a mobile device to aggregate data and applications from data silos into a single seamless experience for a user of the mobile device. The data silos may include SharePoint sites documents from file servers and personal computers intranet web applications services and Windows applications installed on personal computers and or Citrix Terminal servers.

A mobile device in accordance with the techniques of this disclosure may also aggregate cloud services into the same view. Moreover these techniques may provide full view and edit capability to all of these resources e.g. documents and applications using native user interface features provided by the mobile computing device. Furthermore these techniques may leverage mobile device specific applications such as viewers editors and browsers when possible and use screencasting when necessary or preferable. The mobile device may be configured to automatically elect to either execute a local application or screencast a remotely executed application such that a user is not aware of whether a current presentation corresponds to a locally or remotely executed application.

In the example of system also includes remote server devices . Remote server devices generally represent devices associated with storing data for resources maintained by one or more of remote computing devices and or mobile device . Remote server devices may correspond to devices associated with one or more service providers such as software as a service SaaS providers. SaaS providers may include for example DropBox Box.net Salesforce or other cloud based service providers. Remote server devices may additionally or alternatively represent file servers that store data at the discretion of remote computing devices . In general remote computing devices may store data to one or more of remote server devices .

In this manner remote server devices may store data on behalf of remote computing devices . Nevertheless because remote computing devices issue commands to store and or retrieve data from remote server devices resources stored by remote server devices may still be considered to be maintained by remote computing devices . In this manner resources maintained by remote computing devices may include resources stored in storage media of remote computing devices themselves and resources stored by remote server devices at the discretion of remote computing devices .

As another example one or more of remote server devices may correspond to a web server or group of web servers that provide content via hypertext transfer protocol HTTP file transfer protocol FTP real time protocol RTP or other web based protocols. Thus remote server devices may provide resources to remote computing devices and or mobile device in the form of web pages. Remote computing devices may also store bookmarks to web pages hosted by remote server devices . Accordingly web pages and bookmarks to web pages may be considered resources in accordance with the techniques of this disclosure. In general web pages hosted by remote server devices would be considered maintained by the respective remote server devices . Furthermore remote server devices may provide one or more applications that can be manipulated via remote devices such as remote computing devices and or mobile device . Thus such applications may also be considered resources that are maintained by the respective remote server devices . In this manner remote server devices may also act as remote computing devices as described below.

Remote computing devices represent examples of computing devices that are remote relative to mobile device . Typically a device is considered remote to mobile device when a user of mobile device does not have immediate physical access to the device. For example one of remote computing devices may represent a desktop computer at the user s office workplace while the user is at home or traveling. As another example one of remote computing devices may represent a server computer at the user s office that the user can access through a desktop or laptop computer at the user s office. It should also be understood however that a user may in some cases use mobile device while in the physical location of one or more of remote computing devices . For example mobile device may act as a central aggregation point for various resources maintained by remote computing devices .

In general remote computing devices are configured with one or more applications such as word processing applications spreadsheet applications email applications drawing applications web browser applications presentation development applications or the like. These applications are typically configured to save data in a particular file format which is typically represented using a file extension following the last period in a file name for a resource saved by one of the corresponding applications. The manner in which the file format is represented may be based on operating systems executed by remote computing devices . Data such as files maintained or operated on by applications executed by remote computing devices and stored by remote computing devices or stored in remote server devices at the discretion of remote computing devices are generally referred to as resources.

Mobile device represents an example of a mobile device used by the user while away from or while working jointly with one or more of remote computing devices . For example mobile device may correspond to a tablet computing device such as an Apple iPad a Microsoft Windows operating system based tablet or a Google Android device. Mobile device may also correspond to a cellular telephone such as an Apple iPhone a Windows phone or a Google Android phone. In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure mobile device provides access to resources maintained by remote computing devices and or resources provided by remote server devices . In some examples mobile device obtains data representative of one or more of the resources that have a high probability of being accessed by the user. Mobile device may then display graphical representations of the one or more resources and or obtain data for the one or more resources based on the one or more resources having a high probability of being accessed.

Any or all of remote computing devices and mobile device determine resources and or applications that have a high probability of being accessed. For purposes of discussion this disclosure generally describes one of remote computing devices as determining which of the resources have a high probability of being accessed. However it should be understood that mobile device may also or alternatively be configured to make these determinations. Moreover mobile device and or remote computing devices may be configured to jointly determine which of the resources have a high probability of being accessed.

In some examples remote computing devices track values for one or more context dimensions for each of the resources. When a resource is accessed the one of remote computing devices that maintains the resource may update metadata associated with the resource such as for example a time of the access e.g. a timestamp an identity of a device requesting the access e.g. one of remote computing devices or mobile device a geographic location of the user during the access e.g. as determined by a global positioning system GPS of mobile device other resources accessed in close temporal proximity to the current resource or other statistical data that may be useful for determining likelihood or probability of resource access in the future.

Remote computing devices and or mobile device may determine that a resource has a high probability of being accessed when a certain number e.g. all or a threshold number of current value s for one or more context dimensions for the resource match e.g. identically or within respective tolerances values for the one or more context dimensions during historical accesses of the resources. In some examples remote computing devices and or mobile device may calculate a value representative of the probability of a resource being accessed based on any or all of how many of the context dimensions have current values that match the values of the resource for the context dimensions. Moreover in some examples resources may be determined to have a high probability of being accessed when the values representative of the probability exceed a threshold or when the values representative of the probabilities for a certain set of resources exceed values representative of the probabilities for a remaining set of resources.

In some examples a match may correspond to identical values for the context dimension while in other examples a match may correspond to values within a particular tolerance range. In still other examples the value representative of the probability may correspond to an aggregation of differences between current values for the context dimensions and values for the context dimensions during accesses of the resources. Various rules for determining probabilities may also be defined that incorporate any or all of these factors or various combinations of these factors. For example the rules may require exact matches for some context dimensions allow for a degree of tolerance to determine a match for other context dimensions and provide scores corresponding to differences between current values and historical values for still other context dimensions. Thus a match may include an exact match values within a degree of tolerance and differences between values for a context dimension. Various weights may also be assigned to the context dimensions such that a match for one context dimension may have a higher influence on the value representative of the probability than a match for another context dimension.

Accordingly when the user begins using mobile device e.g. when mobile device is turned on or when mobile device logs into one or more of remote computing devices the one or more of remote computing devices may determine current values for the various context dimensions. For example any or all of remote computing devices may determine a current time of day an identity of the device a geographic location of the user whether other resources have recently been accessed and or other such data. The collection of current values for the one or more context dimensions may be referred to as a context for mobile device . Based on the current values or the current context the one or more of remote computing devices determine which of the resources have a high probability of being accessed in the near future.

Remote computing devices may additionally or alternatively be configured to analyze frequencies of accesses of the resources. That is remote computing devices may calculate values representative of how frequently certain resources have been accessed recently relative to the other resources. For example remote computing devices may calculate a relative percentage of accesses of the various resources over a period of time e.g. the last day week month or year for the various resources. Remote computing devices may determine the frequency of access globally and or within the current context of mobile device . Thus remote computing devices may analyze frequency of access when determining resources that have a high probability of being accessed. Accordingly statistics relating to frequency of access may also be referred to as values of a context dimension such as frequency of access dimension. Moreover remote computing devices may be configured to analyze patterns of access which may or may not include temporal frequency of access.

After determining one or more resources that have a high probability of being accessed remote computing devices sends data for the one or more resources to mobile device . This data may include data of the resources themselves such as graphical icons textual names snapshots and or full files for the resources and or instructions for presentation of representations of the one or more resources. For example one of remote computing devices may instruct mobile device to place icons for the highest probability resources in a relatively easily accessible and highly visible screen location e.g. the center of the screen and lower probability resources in a less immediate but still accessible screen location. One of remote computing devices may also or alternatively send instructions for how to display the representations themselves. For example one of remote computing devices may send an instruction indicating a size of an icon for a particular resource based on how probable the resource is to be accessed in the current context.

In this manner mobile device may present representations of resources that have a high probability of being accessed by the user where the resources may be stored by one or more of remote computing devices or remote server devices . Thus higher probability resources may be substantially simpler for the user to access without needing to hunt through multiple screens to find the most relevant data to the user. In this manner the techniques of this disclosure may support one touch access to the user s resources when using mobile device . In addition to presentation of the representations these techniques may be used to temporarily cache resources that are determined to have a high probability of access by mobile device . That is mobile device may receive copies of one or more resources from remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed.

Mobile device may execute an operating system that differs from an operating system of remote computing device . For example remote computing device may execute a Microsoft Windows based operating system a Unix based operating system a Linux based operating system or other such operating system typically installed on desktop or server computing devices. Mobile device on the other hand may execute an operating system such as Apple iOS or Google Android. In some examples remote computing device and mobile device execute different versions of the same operating system or different instances of the same operating system.

In any case for purposes of discussion of the techniques of this disclosure it is assumed that in some cases at least one application installed on remote computing device does not have a counterpart installed on mobile device . In such cases mobile device causes remote computing device to execute the application installed on remote computing device in order to interact with resources maintained by that application. However mobile device may be configured to display output from the application in a format that is optimized for mobile device .

In general applications designed for mobile device conform to a particular output format. For example applications executed by mobile device are typically displayed full screen rather than windowed share a particular font size for displayed text and otherwise have a common look and feel. Applications executed by remote computing device on the other hand tend to have a different output format e.g. being windowed with various text sizes and otherwise having a more application specific output format. Thus rather than directly displaying output from an application executed by remote computing device mobile device may present a graphical representation of the received information in an output format optimized for mobile device .

In addition mobile device typically includes input elements that are not typically present on remote computing device . For example mobile device typically includes a camera an accelerometer and a touchscreen display. The operating system of mobile device may further be configured to interpret certain gestures screen touch commands or other input commands in a particular way. For example mobile devices typically interpret multitouch pinching of the display as zooming in or zooming out. Mobile device may be configured to convert such device specific input commands received when mobile device causes remote computing device to execute an application to an appropriate command for the executed application. For example rather than zooming the entire displayed window in response to a pinch zoom command mobile device may send an instruction to the application to enlarge displayed text only. As another example when a user takes a picture with a camera of mobile device mobile device may make the picture available to the application e.g. by sending the picture to a data buffer such as a software based clipboard of the operating system of remote computing device .

Accordingly remote computing device represents an example of a computing device for determining a set of one or more resources that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future. Remote computing device may receive a request from mobile device for information relating to resources maintained by remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed by mobile device . Mobile device may construct the request such that the request specifies values for one or more context dimensions. As noted above the context dimensions may include for example a geographic location of the user an identifier for mobile device a current time or other such information.

After receiving the request remote computing device may compare the values for the one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between access to resources maintained by remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions. Moreover as noted above remote computing device may collect statistics and metadata for the resources to construct the relationships. For example remote computing device may collect metadata including timestamps geographic locations of a user and identities of devices when a particular resource maintained by remote computing device is accessed. Additionally or alternatively the relationships may specify a frequency of access to the resources e.g. as a percentage of total resource accesses over a period of time.

Based on the collected statistics and the context of mobile device when the request is received remote computing device may determine one or more of the resources that have a high probability of being accessed. In this manner remote computing device may determine one or more of the resources maintained by remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed by mobile device based on the comparison of the values for the one or more context dimensions to the data indicative of the relationships.

Remote computing device may then send information indicative of the determined one or more resources to mobile device . For example remote computing device may send a list identifying the resources in order of the determined probability of access. There may be a cutoff threshold for the probability to terminate the list. In some examples remote computing device may send instructions to mobile device as to how to display representations of the resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed. Moreover remote computing device may send data of the resources e.g. the files themselves to mobile device to cache the resources at mobile device for easy fast access by mobile device in response to a user s selection of one of the resources.

Mobile device represents an example of a mobile device for manipulating resources maintained by remote computing device using either an application executed by mobile device or an application executed by remote computing device at the control of mobile device . In one example mobile device issues a request to access a resource maintained by remote computing device . In some examples mobile device may first display representations of one or more resources determined to have a high probability of access as discussed above. Accordingly a user may select one of the displayed representations to request to access the resource.

The request issued by mobile device may be configured to cause remote computing device to execute an application to access the resource. For example mobile device may be configured to determine whether mobile device includes a local application for manipulating the selected resource. If mobile device does not include such a local application mobile device may cause remote computing device to execute a remote application for manipulating the resource. In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure mobile device may provide input and output features to cause the user experience the remote application as if the application were being executed locally by mobile device .

For example mobile device may receive information corresponding to graphical output resulting from execution of the application to access the resource from remote computing device . The information corresponding to the graphical output may correspond to draw commands raw or encoded image data or other information indicative of the graphical output resulting from execution of the application. Moreover the graphical output corresponds to a format specific to remote computing device .

In accordance with the techniques of this disclosure mobile device may present a graphical representation of the received information in an output format optimized for the mobile device. For example regardless of the format for output on remote computing device mobile device may present the graphical output in such a way that is substantially standard across applications executed by mobile device . For example mobile device may be configured to always display executed applications in full screen mode. Accordingly mobile device may display output of the application executed by remote computing device in a full screen mode such that windowing elements e.g. screen size adjustments and close window icons are hidden. Likewise mobile device may ensure text font and size uniformity across applications for which output is displayed by mobile device .

Moreover mobile device may receive an input command in an input format specific to the mobile device where the input command comprises a command for interacting with the application. For example mobile device may receive a pinch zoom command a command to capture a picture accelerometer input or other such format special format that is relatively unique to mobile device . Mobile device may translate the input command to interact with the application being executed by remote computing device . In this manner mobile device may translate the input command to a format specific to the application executed by remote computing device . For example mobile device may ensure that a pinch zoom command is converted to a command to zoom in the application being executed by remote computing device rather than a command to zoom the full contents of the current display on mobile device . Moreover mobile device may send the translated command to remote computing device .

These techniques may provide an easy to deploy IT ready solution. IT capabilities may include authentication and user permissions from existing AD or LDAP servers support for RSA token as additional authentication factor full IT control logging and monitoring facilities for governance and compliance device authentication with industry standard SSL certificates policy requiring specific device configurations geographical restrictions and the like and data protection to prevent leakage from mobile device.

Furthermore deployment of these techniques may be done in just a few minutes. For example firewalls and servers generally need not be specially configured. In general a full deployment requires only one computing device although as discussed additional computing devices may be involved . In general users or IT administrators may perform a one time enrollment of mobile devices such as mobile device which may result in an SSL certificate being loaded on each authorized device. Devices may be authenticated with SSL certificates distributed to the devices. For example one of remote computing devices may authenticate mobile device using an SSL certificate. Users may be authenticated with their domain credentials before getting access to resources of remote computing devices and or remote server devices .

In accordance with these techniques users can access SharePoint Servers Windows Applications documents on file servers and their PC all from their mobile device with native user experience and controls. IT administrators may also maintain full manageability control and monitoring of users and their actions without taking over the rest of the user s mobile device. Furthermore the users need not configure VPN settings to gain access to the resources.

Control unit represents any combination of hardware software and or firmware elements for performing the functionality attributed to control unit . When implemented in software or firmware it is assumed that control unit also includes requisite hardware for executing such software or firmware such as for example one or more hardware based processors or processing units. Processors of control unit may include one or more of microprocessors digital signal processors DSPs application specific integrated circuits ASICs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs or any other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry as well as any combinations of such components.

Control unit may further include physical non transitory storage media for storing software or firmware instructions. The storage media may include for example random access memory RAM read only memory ROM programmable read only memory PROM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM electronically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory a hard disk a CD ROM a floppy disk a cassette magnetic media optical media or other computer readable storage media.

Control unit also maintains resources . Resources may be stored in a local storage medium such as any of the storage media described above. In other examples remote computing device may maintain resources stored on a separate device such as a shared network drive a server accessible via a network connection or other storage location accessible by remote computing device . Resources may correspond to files associated with particular ones of applications . For example resources may include word processing documents spreadsheet documents graphical documents presentation documents email messages bookmark data for a web browser media or multimedia files such as pictures music or video or other documents. In some examples resources may include additionally or alternatively web pages served by a web server and or applications which are executed on another server such as a Citrix server.

In the example of control unit executes applications and agents . Control unit also includes context management unit which determines context information for resources e.g. values for one or more context dimensions. As noted above the context dimensions may include time of access of resources geographic location of a user when resources are accessed an identity of the device used to access resources e.g. remote computing device mobile device or another device frequency patterns of access other users access that may indicate relevance to a particular user most recent modification time or the like. In particular agents monitor execution of applications using application programming interfaces APIs . That is APIs provide interfaces for agents to monitor which of resources are accessed by applications . Thus when one of applications opens creates modifies or saves one of resources a corresponding one of agents may determine which of resources was accessed. The one of agents may then provide information indicative of the one of resources that was accessed to context management unit . In some examples additional or alternative APIs may be provided to resources behind the applications. For example APIs may be provided that monitor changes to the file system.

When agents indicate that one of resources has been accessed context management unit collects metadata such as values for the various context dimensions for the one of resources . Data aggregation unit of context management unit collects values of the various context dimensions and stores these values along with an identifier of the one of resources as context data . Context data may be represented as a table including columns representative of the various context dimensions and resources and rows representative of accesses of the resources and values for the various context dimensions. The table may have key values corresponding to the time of a resource access where the key values are values for uniquely identifying an entry of the table. In some examples context data is represented by one or more extensible markup language XML documents.

In addition data aggregation unit may also calculate various metrics for resources based on context data . For example data aggregation unit may review entries of context data to determine frequency of access to individual ones of resources . Data aggregation unit may determine for example a raw value or a percentage of accesses of particular ones of resources over a time period or over a number of accesses e.g. the last day week or month or the last 50 or 100 accesses . In this manner data aggregation unit may aggregate values representative of frequency of access to resources .

As described below mobile device may be configured to retrieve entries of context data . Rather than requesting all of context data with each request mobile device may send a request specifying a last entry of the received context data based on the last timestamp received. In this manner context management unit may send new entries of context data to mobile device without resending context data that has already been received by mobile device . In particular context management unit may determine entries having a timestamp greater than the timestamp specified in the request received from mobile device and send data representative of such entries to mobile device in response to the request. In this manner mobile device may use the locally stored context data to determine one or more of resources that have a high probability of being accessed via mobile device .

As an alternative data aggregation unit may generate aggregate data for mobile device . For example data aggregation unit may generate lists of documents applications or other resources that satisfy one or more relevance criteria e.g. one or more values of context dimensions. For example data aggregation unit may filter indicators of resources by recent resources resources that are frequently accessed resources that form part of a particular project or the like. Thus rather than providing raw context data to mobile device remote computing device may provide aggregate data to mobile device . In some examples remote computing device may provide both aggregate data and raw context data to mobile device .

Context management unit is configured to communicate with a corresponding unit of mobile device e.g. context management unit in using a particular communication protocol such as extensible messaging and presence protocol XMPP . XMPP allows for communications based on XML. Accordingly representing context data as XML data may provide for simple transmission of context data to mobile device . XMPP is described in greater detail in RFC 3923 End to End Signaling and Object Encryption for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP by P.

Alternatively mobile device may send a request specifying current values for one or more of the context dimensions to remote computing device . Context determination unit may process the received values of the context dimensions to determine one or more of resources that have a high probability of being accessed via mobile device . Context management unit may send a list of the one or more resources to mobile device or may further provide instructions to mobile device that cause mobile device to present representations of any or all of the one or more of resources . As discussed in greater detail below with respect to these instructions may correspond to instructions on screen locations for icons corresponding to the one or more resources sizes of the icons groupings of the icons or other instructions related to representing the one or more resources determined to have a high probability of access via mobile device .

In this manner remote computing device and or mobile device may use current values for one or more context dimensions to determine one or more of resources that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future by mobile device .

In addition as shown in applications are executed by control unit . In particular applications are generally designed to be executed on computing devices similar to remote computing device . For example control unit may execute an operating system that defines an operating environment for which applications were designed. Assuming for example that the operating environment provides windowed representations of executing applications via a display of user interfaces applications may be displayed in respective windows on the display during execution.

In some cases however as discussed in greater detail below control unit may provide information corresponding to graphical output of execution of one or more of applications to mobile device via network interface . For example the graphical output may include a representation of at least a portion of one of resources being accessed by the one of applications and graphical user interface elements such as buttons scroll bars menus toolbars or other such user interface elements. Buttons may be realized as physical buttons on the housing for mobile device or as virtual elements displayed on a touchscreen e.g. as graphical user interface elements. Control unit may provide the information corresponding to the graphical output to mobile device in accordance with XMPP in some examples. As discussed below mobile device may be configured to modify the graphical output to a format that is determined to be optimal for mobile device rather than displaying what would conventionally be displayed on the display of user interfaces of remote computing device .

During execution of the one of applications remote computing device receives commands from mobile device via network interface . The commands may include commands to interact with the one of applications e.g. to modify data of the accessed one of resources . For example when the application is a word processing application and the resource is a text document remote computing device may receive commands to add delete or format text of the text document. Remote computing device may also receive commands for interacting with the application itself for example to zoom in on the text being displayed without actually changing the formatting of the text in the text document resource.

In this example control unit executes native applications native application simulator user interface module and data retrieval unit . Control unit also includes context determination unit which itself includes context requesting unit and context processing unit . Control unit further includes local data cache which may correspond to data stored in one or more computer readable media of mobile device . The user utilizes user interfaces for input and output when executing native applications such as a touchscreen interface physical manipulation of mobile device recognized by an accelerometer of user interfaces a camera of user interfaces communicatively coupled input or output devices such as a wireless keyboard and or a wireless mouse which may be coupled using Bluetooth or other such input and or output interfaces.

Native applications correspond to applications installed on and executed by control unit . Some of native applications may substantially correspond to applications installed on remote computing device . Accordingly if a user requests to access one of resources maintained by remote computing device and one of native applications is capable of manipulating the resource control unit may execute the corresponding native application to access the resource. All or a portion of data for the resource may be cached locally in local data cache . After making changes to the resource e.g. in response to a save and or close command issued to the local application control unit may send data representative of the changed resource to remote computing device via network interface e.g. in accordance with XMPP. In some examples native applications may implement only a portion of the functionality of corresponding applications executed by one of remote computing devices . For example one of native applications may have only the ability to read but not edit resources of a particular type.

In some cases a user may attempt to access one of resources which none of native applications is capable of accessing. Alternatively although one of native applications may be capable of accessing a resource mobile device may include configuration data indicating that an application executed by remote computing device is preferable over native applications for the resource. For example as noted above one of native applications may not implement the full functionality of a corresponding application executed by remote computing device and thus the application executed by remote computing device may be determined to be preferable. In these cases native application simulator sends instructions to remote computing device or another one of remote computing devices via network interface to cause remote computing device to execute one of applications and to display graphical output of the one of applications via a display of user interfaces . Moreover native application simulator is configured to simulate execution of the application locally such that the user experiences the application as if the application were being executed locally.

For example there may be one or more execution characteristics that apply generally to all native applications . As one example when one of native applications is executed the native application may occupy the entire screen of a display of user interfaces rather than being a windowed application. As another example the formatting of text displayed during execution of native applications may be consistent across native applications . For example text may be displayed in a particular font and have a minimum font size and or a maximum font size.

Moreover user interface module is generally configured to intercept specific input commands that apply either to operating system commands or specific commands for interacting with an application currently being executed. For example a touchscreen display of user interfaces may allow single touch or multitouch commands such as pinch zoom swiping between applications to change which application is currently displayed swiping to reveal a status bar swiping to scroll horizontally or vertically rotational gestures to rotate a display navigating back or forward in a web browser taps multitaps or long presses to select or interact with graphical user interface elements flicks to navigate between documents or the like. Such touch or multitouch commands are typically not supported by applications executed by remote computing device and therefore native application simulator is configured to translate such commands to analogous commands of applications .

In general when a user uses one of user interfaces of mobile device native application simulator is configured to translate the use of that interface to an appropriate action for interacting with one of applications executed by remote computing device . For example if a user were to use a camera of user interfaces to capture an image native application simulator may send data of the captured image to a clipboard of an operating system of remote computing device or directly into a specific document or application such that the image is available for use by the one of applications .

Moreover native application simulator may translate graphical output resulting from execution of the one of applications into a format that is optimized for mobile device . For example as noted above native applications may all be executed in a full screen mode. Whereas the one of applications may be executed in a window on remote computing device native application simulator may modify the output of the application such that window elements e.g. minimize maximize and close buttons are hidden and such that the application is displayed full screen on a display of user interfaces .

As another example native application simulator may increase or decrease font sizes or otherwise modify font formats to be consistent with a font schema specific to mobile device . As a further example native application simulator may convert a color palette for output resulting from execution of one of applications to a color palette schema defined for mobile device .

In this manner the output of the one of applications executed by remote computing device may appear as if the application is being executed locally on mobile device when in fact the application is being executed by remote computing device . Likewise input commands issued to mobile device which may be specific to mobile device may be converted to appropriate commands for the one of applications executed by remote computing device .

Furthermore native application simulator may provide additional or alternative graphical user interface elements when one of applications is being executed by remote computing device and displayed on a display of user interfaces . For example for a word processing application native application simulator may display a spellcheck button on a display of user interfaces even though the graphical output resulting from execution of the application by remote computing device does not include a spellcheck button. Accordingly if a user selects the spellcheck button e.g. by tapping the spellcheck button native application simulator translates the selection to an appropriate command to initiate a spellcheck function by the application executed by remote computing device . Similarly native application simulator may hide one or more graphical user interface elements that would otherwise be displayed during execution of the application by remote computing device .

Native application simulator may also be configured to generate a menu system built natively for mobile device which may replace or supplement a menu system of the application executed by remote computing device . In this manner the menu system built natively for mobile device may act as a substitute menu system that is displayed in place of the menu system for the application executed by the remote computing device. Moreover native application simulator may generally hide the mobile device menu until a request to view the menu such as a pull down gesture is received. Native application simulator may further resize one or more graphical user interface elements e.g. to enlarge these elements which may simplify finger touch selection of the elements. For example native application simulator may resize icons on the Microsoft Office Ribbon toolbar. As another example native application simulator may resize a context menu e.g. a menu produced by right clicking on a resource.

Native application simulator may also display buttons that cause a sequence of actions on the desktop executed application to occur. For example the buttons may be mapped to macros that send a series of commands to the desktop executed application. Moreover native application simulator may disable certain commands or hide certain graphical user interface elements. In this manner one or more buttons illustrated by native application simulator may be mapped to macros that represent one or more actions to be executed by the remote computing device. In some examples the button may be mapped to a series of commands to be issued by mobile device to the remote computing device. In some examples the series of commands may be encapsulated within a script that is issued to the remote computing device which may cause the remote computing device to execute the script and thereby perform each action.

Furthermore native application simulator may display mobile device specific buttons for commands that are performed during execution of an application by the remote computing device. For example native application simulator may display mobile device specific buttons for saving a current document deleting or renaming a file for the document formatting options such as bold underline or italics or the like.

In some examples a sequence of commands may cause the remote computing device to move data for resources maintained by the remote computing device between remote computing devices remote server devices and or mobile device . For example the commands may cause the remote computing device to send data for one of the resources between any or all of Google Docs Box.net an iPad and a personal computer. The commands may also cause one or more devices to share a document. For example data for a resource may be moved to a location that is accessible to all devices needing access to the document e.g. one of remote server devices and two or more devices may simultaneously access the resource. Alternatively the commands may cause the remote computing device to email or otherwise distribute the document to other devices.

Some commands may be considered inappropriate for mobile device and may therefore be disabled. Graphical user interface elements for performing such commands may be hidden greyed out and thereby unselectable or removed entirely from the display by native application simulator . For example MS Office offers a Customize Keyboard option that is typically not appropriate for touchscreen based devices. Therefore native application simulator may hide or remove this element. As another example native application simulator may disable user interface controls based on policies such as preventing unlocking of a password protected document by omitting display of a screen to enter the password. Likewise lesser used commands may be removed e.g. by configuration or dynamically to reduce clutter. These removed commands may be replaced in a separate user interface window that the user may specifically request. Moreover native application simulator may provide a view only mode for viewing resources to avoid inadvertent changes to the document.

Native application simulator may also change displayed text associated with certain commands. For example native application simulator may change the word click to touch change mouse wheel to two finger touch or make other appropriate changes.

As another example native application simulator may replace a login screen e.g. for user access control UAC with a mobile device specific login screen for logging into one or more of remote computing devices . In this manner the user may use the mobile device specific login screen to log into one or more remote devices.

In addition or in the alternative native application simulator may display graphical user interface elements that are mapped to device specific commands which may allow actions that would not typically be performed on a desktop application. For example native application simulator may allow a user to tag a document with a geographic location e.g. GPS coordinates attach a picture to a document or other resource from a camera move data for one of the resources to mobile device or move data from mobile device to the remote computing device cut and paste between a resource managed by remote computing device and a local resource of mobile device or other such actions. Furthermore in some examples native application simulator may provide the ability to display two documents side by side for special workflow cases. For example a user may wish to view two documents side by side in order to cut and paste between the documents refer to one document while editing another document or other such scenarios. In this manner native application simulator may provide the user with the ability to view two documents simultaneously.

Moreover in some examples native application simulator may be configured to present various workflow specific graphical user interfaces. That is native application simulator may be configured to present groups of graphical user interface elements e.g. buttons organized around a particular workflow to make that workflow easier. For example for a review changes workflow native application simulator may display buttons for commands related to reviewing changes such as accept or reject change go to next or previous change or the like. As another example for a commenting workflow the buttons may include add or delete comment buttons and go to next or previous comment. In addition native application simulator may depict buttons for more simple navigation of a document such as by displaying a table of contents that depicts pages of the document such that touching a page allows the user to access the selected page.

In this manner mobile device may be configured to improve a user s experience when interacting with resources maintained by remote computing device . That is the user may experience interactions with resources in such a way that the user is not necessarily aware of whether the application being used to interact with resources is a native application e.g. native applications or a remote application e.g. one of applications that is augmented by native application simulator . Accordingly a user may feel as if the applications used to access resources are native applications to mobile device regardless of what one of resources is being accessed.

To further improve a user s experience mobile device may be configured to determine one or more of resources maintained by remote computing device or resources maintained by any of remote computing devices that have a high probability of being accessed at a particular time or in a particular context. For example as discussed above remote computing device mobile device or other devices may keep track of context data representative of accesses to each of resources as well as values for various context dimensions when the accesses occur. Using the context data as well as a current context remote computing device mobile device or another device may determine which of resources have a high probability of being accessed given the current context.

Suppose for example that a particular user accesses email as the first action taken on mobile device every day at approximately the same time in the morning. The context data would include data representative of times that an email mailbox resource is accessed. Thus when the user begins a session using mobile device at that time in the morning on later days mobile device or remote computing device may determine that because of the current time there is a high probability that the email mailbox resource will be accessed. Accordingly mobile device may be configured to display a graphical representation of the email mailbox resource in a prominent easily accessible screen location at that time in the morning.

As another example suppose that a user has been working on a particular document at various times throughout the day and that the percentage of time spent accessing that particular document over the past week is relatively high e.g. higher than most other resources. The context data would reflect that the document is accessed with a relatively high percentage of accesses relative to other ones of resources . Therefore mobile device or remote computing device may determine that the particular document has a high probability of being accessed when the user begins to use mobile device .

Moreover in some examples control unit may provide the ability to search resources stored by one or more of remote computing devices and or remote server devices . For example control unit may render a user interface for searching for a particular resource by keyword contents of the resource metadata for the resource such as update or save dates location tags or the like or other search criteria. In this manner a user may search for a resource stored by mobile device one of remote computing devices or one of remote server devices .

In general values may be tracked for a variety of different context dimensions whenever one of resources is accessed. As noted above the various context dimensions may include a time of day of the access an identity of a device used to access the resource a frequency of access to the resource other resources accessed in close temporal proximity to the resource a geographic location of a user when the resource is accessed or other such context dimensions. Accordingly a current intersection of values of the various context dimensions may be used to determine a current context. The current context may further be used to determine which of resources is likely to be accessed that is has a high probability of being accessed in the near future given the current context.

Context determination unit of mobile device represents an example of a unit of mobile device for determining a current context as well as for determining one or more of resources that have a high probability of being accessed given the current context. For example context determination unit determines current values for the context dimensions e.g. when mobile device performs a login procedure with remote computing device and or periodically while connected to remote computing device .

In some examples context requesting unit requests context data from remote computing device . For example context requesting unit may construct a request for updated context data from remote computing device that also specifies a timestamp of a most recent update from remote computing device . Other unique identifiers rather than a timestamp may also be used such as a version number. In response to the request context determination unit receives aggregate context data having timestamps after the timestamp specified in the request or other unique identifying information . In this manner context requesting unit may request only aggregate context data that has not yet been received as well as remove antiquated aggregate context data. Context requesting unit stores the aggregate context data in local data cache in this example. Then context processing unit compares current values for one or more context dimensions to the updated aggregate context data stored in local data cache to determine one or more of resources maintained by remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future based on the current context.

In other examples context requesting unit requests data representative of one or more of resources that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future from remote computing device . In these examples context requesting unit forms a request that specifies the current context by specifying current values for the one or more context dimensions. In response to the request context determination unit receives information from remote computing device indicative of one or more of resources that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future.

In some examples data retrieval unit retrieves data for one or more of resources that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future from remote computing device via network interface . For example data retrieval unit may retrieve graphical representations of the one or more resources such as icons and or snapshots of the resources from remote computing device . In addition or in the alternative data retrieval unit may retrieve all or a portion of the resources themselves such that if one or more of the resources are actually accessed via mobile device the time to access the resource s is relatively short. Typically data retrieval unit would only retrieve data of the resources themselves for resources that can be accessed by native applications . Even if the resources are not accessed immediately retrieving data for the resources themselves may still be advantageous if mobile device needs to disconnect from remote computing device e.g. due to entering airplane mode losing a wireless signal or otherwise not having an active network connection. Data retrieval unit stores retrieved data in local data cache which may be accessed by native applications native application simulator and or user interface module .

Mobile device next determines local context information . For example mobile device may determine values for one or more context dimensions such as a current time of day a geographic location recently accessed resources or the like. In this example mobile device sends a request specifying the local context information to remote computing device .

In response to receiving the request remote computing device determines one or more resources that are most likely to be accessed . That is remote computing device determines one or more of resources that are likely to be accessed by a user of mobile device in the near future based on the current context information specified in the received request. As discussed above remote computing device may make this determination based on historical accesses of the resources and values for the context dimensions when the resources were accessed.

For example remote computing device may calculate an aggregate score based on how well the current context defined by the request from mobile device matches historical contexts in which the resources were previously accessed. A relatively high aggregate score for a particular resource may indicate that the resource is commonly accessed in a context that is similar to the current context for mobile device . A relatively low aggregate score for a particular resource may however indicate that the resource is not typically accessed in a context that is similar to the current context for mobile device . Individual score values may be calculated for each of the context dimensions e.g. based on a binary value whether the current value for the dimension matches a value of the dimension for a particular resource or a numeric value corresponding to how closely the current value for the context dimension matches a value of the dimension for a particular resource. As an example remote computing device may assign a binary value to a context dimension representative of an identifier of a device used to access a resource whereas remote computing device may assign a numeric value to a context dimension representative of a time of access to a particular resource. In this manner if the current time value is 7 05 am resources having common accesses at 7 00 am may receive a higher score for the time context dimension than resources having common accesses at 12 00 pm as one example.

In any case in the example of remote computing device uses the determination of resources having a high probability of being accessed in the near future to determine display information for mobile device . The display information generally defines a presentation of graphical representations of the resources by mobile device . For example the display information may include icons for the resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed as well as location information defining where the icons should be displayed on the screen. In some examples the display information may further indicate that some icons should be displayed more prominently e.g. at different sizes than other icons. For example the display information nay indicate that more likely resources should be displayed in a larger size whereas icons for relatively less likely resources should be displayed in a smaller size on the screen. In any case in the example of remote computing device sends the information specifying the display to mobile device .

In response to receiving the display information mobile device updates a current display based on the display information . For example mobile device may render an image including icons a snapshot or other graphical representation for the most likely resources at positions on the screen as defined by the display information received from remote computing device . Likewise if the display information specifies sizes for the icons mobile device may render the icons such that the sizes correspond to the sizes defined by the display information.

It should be understood that represents merely one example in which remote computing device determines the most likely resources to be accessed and generates the display information accordingly. In other examples mobile device may be configured to determine which of the resources is most likely to be accessed in the near future. In such examples mobile device may perform a similar analysis to that performed by remote computing device as described above. Moreover in such examples mobile device may request context data from remote computing device that provides indications of accesses to resources and values for one or more context dimensions at the time of the resource accesses. Also as noted above mobile device may request only new context data e.g. context data occurring after a specified time to avoid retrieving data that mobile device has already received. In such examples mobile device may determine the graphical information such as how to present graphical representations of the resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed in the near future.

In any case after displaying graphical representations of the resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed mobile device may receive a selection of a resource to be accessed from a user . The selection may be a selection of one of the resources determined to be most likely or a different resource. In any case mobile device may execute an application for the selected resource . As discussed in greater detail with respect to in some examples mobile device may cause remote computing device to execute one of applications to access the resource rather than executing one of native applications such as when none of native applications is capable of accessing the selected resource or when an application executed by remote computing device is determined to be more appropriate.

In response to the access of the resource mobile device sends updated context information regarding the accessed resource to remote computing device . For example the updated information may include a current context in which the resource was accessed which may be defined by values for one or more of the context dimensions at the time the selected resource was accessed. In response to receiving the updated context information from mobile device remote computing device updates the context information e.g. context data to store a new entry in a table of accesses to resources and values for the one or more context dimensions when the resources are accessed.

In this manner represents an example of a method of determining one or more resources that have a high probability of being accessed. In this example the method includes comparing current values for one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between accesses to resources maintained by a remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions during the accesses. The method also includes determining one or more of the resources maintained by the remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed based on the comparison. The method further includes causing a mobile device to obtain information indicative of the determined one or more resources based on the determination that the one or more resources have the high probability of being accessed. All or individual portions of this method may be performed by remote computing device or mobile device or other such devices.

The device further stores a geographic location of a user at the time of the access which may be based in part on the identity of the device used to access the resource. For example if the user uses remote computing device to access the resource the device stores a geographic location of remote computing device . On the other hand if the user uses mobile device to access the resource mobile device may determine its current geographic location using a global positioning system GPS receiver of mobile device . In the example of the device further updates a frequency of access of the resource relative to other resources . The frequency of access may correspond to a raw number of times the resource has been accessed over a period of time or over a number of accesses or a percentage of times the resource has been accessed over a period of time or over a number of total resource accesses.

In this manner the method of may be used to maintain historical data e.g. context data representative of accesses to resources maintained by remote computing device . The data also represents values for one or more context dimensions at times when resources are accessed. In this manner the context data can be used for subsequent analysis such as described with respect to to determine resources that are most likely to be accessed that is have a high probability of being accessed in a particular context.

The device may further determine frequency of accesses of various resources e.g. based on the determined values of the time of day the identity of the accessing device and the geographic location universally without consideration of these values or both . The combination of values for these various context dimensions may represent a current context for the device that is to be used to access a resource. The device may further compare the current context to contexts of previous resource accesses . That is the device may compare current values for one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between accesses to resources maintained by remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions during the accesses. In this manner the device may determine one or more of the resources that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future based on historical resource access information as gathered via the method of .

In addition the device may display representations of the determined resources . For example the device may display graphical representations such as icons snapshots or other representations of the resources such that the display is defined according to the probabilities that the resources will be accessed in the near future. That is representations of resources having a relatively higher probability of being accessed may be displayed more prominently than representations of resources having a relatively lower probability of being accessed. Assuming in one example that the device is mobile device mobile device may further obtain data for the determined resources . For example mobile device may request data for the resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed or remote computing device may send data for the resources to mobile device .

In this manner represents an example of a method of determining one or more resources that have a high probability of being accessed. In this example the method includes comparing current values for one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between accesses to resources maintained by a remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions during the accesses. The method also includes determining one or more of the resources maintained by the remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed based on the comparison. The method further includes causing a mobile device to obtain information indicative of the determined one or more resources based on the determination that the one or more resources have the high probability of being accessed. All or individual portions of this method may be performed by remote computing device or mobile device or other such devices.

Initially mobile device may display graphical representations of high probability resources that is resources having a high probability of being accessed in the near future . Step of the method of may correspond to step of or step of . In any case mobile device may receive a selection of a resource from a user . The selected resource need not have been one of the resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed. Although not shown in mobile device may cause context data for the selected resource to be updated based on the selection e.g. as discussed with respect to .

In any case mobile device may determine whether one of native applications is capable of accessing the selected resource . For example mobile device may analyze a file extension or file type associated with the resource and determine whether any of native applications is associated with the file extension or file type of the resource. If one of native applications is capable of and in some examples more desirable than an application executed by the remote computing device for accessing the resource YES branch of mobile device retrieves data for the resource from remote computing device . Mobile device furthers cache the data for the resource locally e.g. within local data cache . Furthermore mobile device executes the one of native applications to display edit or otherwise interact with the selected resource .

On the other hand if none of native applications is capable of accessing the resource NO branch of mobile device instructs remote computing device to execute one of applications in order to display edit or otherwise interact with the selected resource . Mobile device also receives output of the executed one of applications during execution of the one of applications . The output generally corresponds to graphical output intended for a display local to remote computing device . However mobile device displays the output in a mobile device native format . That is mobile device displays the output in a format that is optimized for mobile device . For example mobile device may ensure that the actual display corresponds to various defined output schemas e.g. regarding whether to display the output in a window or full screen text formatting such as text size and font correspond to a text schema for mobile device a color palette corresponds to a color scheme for mobile device or other such output format concerns.

As noted above mobile device also provides input mechanisms not generally supported by applications . For example mobile device provides support for touch based input such as multitouch input which is considered one example of mobile device native input commands. As another example a user may utilize an element of mobile device for input such as capturing an image via a camera of mobile device or receiving geographic information via a GPS unit of mobile device . These inputs are considered another example of mobile device specific native input commands. Mobile device may also display graphical user interface elements during execution of the one of applications that is not generated as part of the output from execution of the one of applications . Accordingly selection of one of these graphical user interface elements is further considered an example of a mobile device native input command. In any case mobile device may receive a mobile device native input command such as one of those discussed above or other such mobile device specific input commands.

In response to such a command mobile device translates the command to an application command . Likewise mobile device sends the translated command to remote computing device . For example mobile device translates touch based input and multitouch input to commands for interacting with the application or an operating system of remote computing device . Thus if a user provides a pinch zoom command when mobile device is displaying output resulting from execution of a word processing document only the text field used to view and edit text of a text document resource would be zoomed as opposed to zooming the entire displayed application including graphical user interface elements of the graphical user interface of the one of applications . As another example if the user captures an image using a camera of mobile device mobile device may send the image to a clipboard of the application or the operating system executed by remote computing device or other destinations such as to the application itself as executed by remote computing device .

In this manner the method of represents an example of a method for ensuring a consistent user experience whether mobile device executes one of native applications or whether mobile device causes remote computing device to execute one of applications . The method includes issuing by a mobile device a request to access a resource maintained by a remote computing device wherein the request causes the remote computing device to execute an application to access the resource. The method also includes receiving information corresponding to graphical output resulting from execution of the application to access the resource from the remote computing device wherein the graphical output corresponds to a format specific to the remote computing device. The method further includes presenting a graphical representation of the received information in an output format optimized for the mobile device. Likewise the method includes receiving an input command in an input format specific to the mobile device wherein the input command comprises a command for interacting with the application. The method also includes translating the input command to a format specific to the application executed by the remote computing device and sending the translated command to the remote computing device.

In this example mobile device maintains context data in local data cache . The context data includes timestamps for entries corresponding to accesses of the resources and values for the one or more context dimensions. To avoid retrieving context data that has already been received mobile device sends a request specifying a timestamp of a last context update to remote computing device . In response to receiving the request remote computing device determines entries of context data that have timestamps later than the timestamp specified in the request . Then remote computing device sends the determined context data to mobile device .

Mobile device subsequently receives the updated context data from remote computing device . As noted above in the example of mobile device determines ones of resources maintained by remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed in the near future. To do so mobile device compares the current context information to the updated context data . This comparison generally indicates resources that have been recently and or frequently accessed in contexts similar to the current context determined at step . Those resources that are recently and or frequently accessed in contexts similar to the current context are said to have a high probability of being accessed in the near future.

Using the resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed mobile device determines display information for these resources . The display information may correspond to positions and or sizes of icons for resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed. Mobile device may update a display based on the determined display information . In addition mobile device may receive a resource selection from a user and execute an application to access the selected resource . Although not shown in the method may further include updating the context information based on the selected resource that was accessed.

In this manner both and represent examples of methods including comparing current values for one or more context dimensions to data indicative of relationships between accesses to resources maintained by a remote computing device and values for the one or more context dimensions during the accesses determining one or more of the resources maintained by the remote computing device that have a high probability of being accessed based on the comparison and causing a mobile device to obtain information indicative of the determined one or more resources based on the determination that the one or more resources have the high probability of being accessed.

In particular causing a mobile device to obtain information for one or more resources determined to have a high probability of being accessed may be performed either by mobile device or by remote computing device . That is in some examples remote computing device sends information for the one or more resources to mobile device which causes mobile device to obtain the information. In other examples mobile device requests the information from remote computing device which also causes mobile device to obtain the information. As noted above the obtained information may include graphical representations of the resources such as icons or snapshots of the resources or all or a portion of the data for the resources themselves.

The home screen as shown in the example of is generally a dashboard of documents and applications from all data and application silos such as resources maintained by remote computing devices stored by any or all of remote computing devices and or remote server devices . As shown in this example each resource e.g. each document has a preview tile to help identify it regardless of whether it is a Box.net file a Salesforce record a document stored in SharePoint or other resource stored elsewhere. In this example the home screen is organized to highlight items recently used by a worker from their PC or mobile device. This may assist a user in the ability to pick up where they left off from their desk. Users can use unified full text search and browse capabilities across everything in case they need something they can t find here e.g. using search box . From the screen shown in a user may select a resource to launch execution of an application for interacting with the resource as described in greater detail below with respect to .

In this manner with one touch a user can open a document sales record or other item or resource hosted on a cloud service like Box.net Google Docs and or Salesforce.com. Mobile device may open a viewer and editor for the document such as graphical user interface . This viewer is a native application for mobile device such as a native browser for an iPad so viewing scrolling and editing are natively handled by mobile device and may be incredibly responsive.

In this manner a user can open a Microsoft Word or PowerPoint document from any of the available data sources e.g. remote computing devices and or remote server devices . Mobile device may open a full screen view of the application screencast from the device executing the application e.g. a device of an enterprise. The user can view and edit the document locally on mobile device . Input specific to mobile device such as native gestures like swiping to scroll and pinch zoom work as expected by the user. That is mobile device may convert commands received in a format specific to mobile device into proper corresponding commands for the application being executed by the remote computing device.

Device and user authentication for mobile devices and users thereof may be handled by normal on premises infrastructure e.g. authentication devices of enterprise . As discussed above enterprise may issue SSL certificates to mobile devices for authenticating mobile devices to enterprise . Data exchanged over the end to end secure tunnel may be encrypted between the PC and the mobile device and thus not visible to session connector or anyone else.

In addition mobile devices may be configured to interact with cloud based resources such as Google Docs Box.net Salesforce and other SaaS software as a service applications. Mobile devices and devices of enterprise may be configured to prevent documents from being moved between enterprise and cloud sources or to selectively enable such movement of resources. In this manner IT administrators may have fine granularity of control to enable or disable cloud services as well as to monitor usage of the services. Mobile devices may intermingle resources stored and maintained by both cloud services and enterprise automatically. Moreover mobile devices may allow users to perform full text searching across cloud based services and enterprise .

The Windows server implementing enterprise gateway may handle client certificate authentication without external software so that the server controls security for enterprise . Thus enterprise gateway may gather credentials from a user and authenticate the user against the enterprise LDAP AD or RADIUS server which may be provided within enterprise . In this manner enterprise gateway may ensure that no data passes to the intranet of enterprise until a device and user are fully authenticated. User authentication may even include a second factor such as an RSA token. No port needs to be opened between the intranet and DMZ. The example of system may provide a high security solution for enabling a mobile workforce without any reliance on cloud components.

In some examples an enterprise may deploy these techniques on existing servers such as Citrix or Terminal Services servers. This may eliminate dependence on workers PCs except for documents or applications that only exist on those PCs. This can be done in addition to or instead of installation on user s PCs.

The techniques described in this disclosure may be implemented at least in part in hardware software firmware or any combination thereof. For example various aspects of the described techniques may be implemented within one or more processors including one or more microprocessors digital signal processors DSPs application specific integrated circuits ASICs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs or any other equivalent integrated or discrete logic circuitry as well as any combinations of such components. The term processor or processing circuitry may generally refer to any of the foregoing logic circuitry alone or in combination with other logic circuitry or any other equivalent circuitry. A control unit comprising hardware may also perform one or more of the techniques of this disclosure.

Such hardware software and firmware may be implemented within the same device or within separate devices to support the various operations and functions described in this disclosure. In addition any of the described units modules or components may be implemented together or separately as discrete but interoperable logic devices. Depiction of different features as modules or units is intended to highlight different functional aspects and does not necessarily imply that such modules or units must be realized by separate hardware or software components. Rather functionality associated with one or more modules or units may be performed by separate hardware or software components or integrated within common or separate hardware or software components.

The techniques described in this disclosure may also be embodied or encoded in a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium containing instructions. Instructions embedded or encoded in a computer readable medium may cause a programmable processor or other processor to perform the method e.g. when the instructions are executed. Computer readable media may include non transitory computer readable storage media and transient communication media. Computer readable storage media which is tangible and non transitory may include random access memory RAM read only memory ROM programmable read only memory PROM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM electronically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory a hard disk a CD ROM a floppy disk a cassette magnetic media optical media or other computer readable storage media. It should be understood that the term computer readable storage media refers to physical storage media and not signals carrier waves or other transient media.
