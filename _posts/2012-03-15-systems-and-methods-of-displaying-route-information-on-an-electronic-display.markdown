abstract: Systems and methods of displaying route information on an electronic display. The information includes a number of routes that extend within the displayed area. A large amount of information about the routes is stored in or accessible by the system. Therefore, the systems and methods are configured to initially display a map with much of the information being withheld. This initial map is clean and the displayed information is relevant to the user. The system is then configured to receive input requesting that the system display more specific information about the relevant routes of interest to the user.

The present application is directed to systems and methods of providing route information on an electronic display and more particularly to systems and methods of displaying route information in a meaningful way without initially providing too much information.

Maps exist for displaying a variety of different types of information. The maps may include the geography of a region including oceans lakes rivers mountains deserts etc. The maps may also include man made aspects such as routes buildings towns cities etc. Maps may also display the product flow through a building. The information associated with the map may include broad general aspects such as the border of a state or country as well as more detailed narrow aspects such as a specific route within a town.

A user viewing the map may only be interested in a relatively small amount of the information. For example the user may be interested in a specific location on the map or a particular service offered within the area of the map.

The manner of displaying the information to the user is important to ensure the user receives the relative information in a manner that he she can comprehend. Displaying too much information may only confuse the user and obfuscate the relevant information. However displaying just broad features on the map may frustrate the user who is in need of more detailed information.

There is a need for systems and methods of displaying information on a map in a logical manner that does not confuse the user. The systems and methods should display a first amount of information on the map that orients the user and introduces general broad concepts. The systems and methods should also be configured to display additional information that is relevant to the user.

The present application is directed to systems and methods of displaying route information on an electronic display. One aspect includes a method implemented by a server communicatively coupled to a client device for causing the client device to display a graphical depiction of route information on an electronic display. The method includes sending the client device executable instructions that when executed by one or more processing circuits of the client device cause the client device to display serviced routes and non serviced routes that extend within a geographic area with each of the serviced routes having a common appearance that is different than the non serviced routes. The method also includes that responsive to receiving input regarding a selected one of the serviced routes continue to display each of the serviced and non serviced routes and display an additional highlight on the selected route that has a different appearance than the non serviced routes and the other serviced routes.

The application also includes a method for causing a client device to display a graphical depiction of route information on an electronic display. The method includes sending the client device executable instructions that when executed by one or more processing circuits of the client device cause the client device to display serviced routes and non serviced routes that extend within a geographic area with each of the serviced routes being displayed with a first indicator having a first appearance and each of the non serviced routes being displayed with a different second indicator having a different second appearance. The method also includes that responsive to receiving input regarding a selected location within the geographic area that lies on a first route of the serviced routes display the first route with a combination of the first indicator and a third indicator display a remainder of the serviced routes with the first indicator and display the non serviced routes with the second indicator. The combination of the first indicator and the third indicator has a third appearance that is different than the first and second appearances.

The application also includes a server communicatively coupled to a client device and configured to send the client device executable instructions that when executed by one or more processing circuits of the client device cause the client device to display a graphical depiction of route information on an electronic display. The executable instructions cause the client device to display serviced routes and non serviced routes that extend within a geographic area with each of the serviced routes being displayed with a first indicator having a first appearance and each of the non serviced routes being displayed with a different second indicator having a different second appearance. Responsive to receiving input regarding a selected location within the geographic area that lies on a first route of the serviced routes display the first route with a combination of the first indicator and a third indicator display a remainder of the serviced routes with the first indicator and display the non serviced routes with the second indicator with the combination of the first indicator and the third indicator having a third appearance that is different than the first and second appearances.

The various aspects of the various embodiments may be used alone or in any combination as is desired.

The present application is directed to systems and methods of displaying route information on an electronic display. The route information includes a number of routes that extend within the displayed area. A large amount of information about the routes is stored in or is accessible by the system. This information would be difficult to comprehend by a user if it all was initially displayed. Therefore the systems and methods are configured to initially display a map with much of the information being withheld. This initial map is clean and the displayed information is relevant to the user. The system is then configured to receive input requesting that the system display additional and or more specific information about the relevant routes of interest to the user.

The information displayed includes background information and route information. The background information includes geographic aspects of the area and provides a context for the route information. The background information may include geographic aspects of the area such as lakes rivers mountains islands etc. The background information may also include governmental boundaries such as countries states cities towns etc. In some contexts when the map relates to a manufacturing process the background information may include the layout of a warehouse assembly process and the like. Identifying names may also be included for these various types of background information depending upon the detail of the display.

The route information includes routes that extend within the displayed area. The routes include serviced routes that are part of a particular service relevant to the user and non serviced routes that do not include the particular service. The serviced routes are those that are serviced by a particular service such as one or more transportation systems. Transportation systems may include bus lines airlines trains trucks taxis boats and combinations thereof. These transportation systems may be used for carrying various types of cargo including but not limited to people and freight. The serviced routes may also identify process flow steps along an assembly line. The non serviced routes are other routes in the display area that do not include the particular service e.g. a small road that does not include bus service . The route information may also be directed to other process configurations such as network processes business logic processes and service failure processes.

Route information may further include one or more targets that move along the serviced routes. These targets may include the vehicles in the various transportation systems such as buses cars trucks trains planes etc. The targets may also include freight such as mail luggage manufactured goods and the like. The route information shows the progression of these targets along the corresponding serviced routes.

The system is further configured to display the map at various levels of detail. The levels of detail may vary from a macro level such that the user can view a continent or state to a micro level such that the user can view a specific town or portion of an assembly line. The system is configured for the user to be able to select the desired level of detail. The level establishes at least in part the amount of detail regarding the background and route information that is displayed on the map. This ensures that the map does not include too much detail that makes it difficult for the user to obtain the relevant information.

In some embodiments the device serves as a stand alone system capable of displaying the maps as described herein. The device may comprise for instance a stand alone kiosk located at a transportation station or stop e.g. at a bus stop . In this case the device s memory stores the background information and route information. The device s processing circuit s access and process this stored information to display the map on the electronic screen in accordance with user input received via the user interface .

In other embodiments the device receives at least some of the background information and or route information from other nodes via a communications interface . illustrates various examples of these embodiments.

In the device s communications interface communicatively couples the device to one or more servers A B. The communications interface may couple the device to these servers A B via a packet data network e.g. the Internet and or a wireless communications system e.g. a High Speed Packet Access HSPA system . The device receives route information from server A referred to as the route service server and receives background information from server B referred to as the mapping service server. Receiving information from servers A B in this way the device may be referred to as a client device .

As noted above the route information may include the location of targets moving along routes. In this regard one or more targets may determine and report their location to the route service server A via the wireless communication system and the packet data network . The route service server A then relays these target locations to the client device .

Regardless the servers A and B comprise web servers in one particular embodiment. Referring back to the device s processing circuits in this case execute web browser application code stored in memory to thereby create a web browser application . This web browser application receives a web page or other executable instructions e.g. a Flash file from one of the servers such as the route service server A. The executable instructions contain client side script that references an external Application Programming Interface API provided by the other server i.e. the mapping service server B. The web browser application is configured to import the external API and execute the instructions and external API as an aggregated web application also known as a mashup . The runtime environment that supports this aggregated web application includes the route information and background information as client side resources available for use at the client device .

With the route information and background information accessible as client side resources the web browser application aggregates the information to display the map. In at least some embodiments the route information specifies the location of available routes using the same coordinate system as that used by the background information to specify the location of geographic aspects of the area. The web browser application then effectively overlays a layer of route information on top of a layer of background information to generate the map in accordance with input received from the user.

In at least some embodiments the client device receives all of the route and background information needed to display the map at any level of detail for a particular area of interest. User input may thereafter be received directing the client device to display the map for a different area of interest. Responsive to such input the client device requests that the servers A B provide the device with all of the route and background information needed to display the map at any level of detail for this new area of interest. By requesting and receiving information as needed for different areas of interest the client device efficiently utilizes the communication resources of the system.

While the client device was described above as receiving the background information from a different server than the server from which it received the route information in other embodiments the client device receives the background and route information from the same server. In general therefore the client device receives executable instructions from one or more servers that cause the device to display a graphical depiction of the route information on an electronic screen in the context of the background information . Such executable instructions may comprise for example static or dynamic client side script sent to the client device by the server in the context of a web page request. The instructions may therefore comprise any combination of Javascript Actionscript or other client side script. The instructions may alternatively comprise compiled code.

In another embodiment the client device determines at least some of the route and background information on its own. This information is not received through a server.

The executable instructions when executed by the one or more processing circuits of the client device cause the client device to display a graphical depiction of route information on its electronic display . Specifically the executable instructions cause the client device to display serviced routes and non serviced routes that extend within an area. When displayed in this way each of the serviced routes has a common appearance so as to provide a uniform visual indication of an aggregate of the serviced routes. For example the serviced routes may each have the same color e.g. white . In some embodiments the common appearance of the serviced routes renders different serviced routes indistinguishable from one another. Regardless each of the non serviced routes has a different appearance than the serviced routes e.g. the non serviced routes may be colored black .

With the routes displayed in this way the client device may be configured to receive user input regarding a selected one of the serviced routes. Responsive to such user input the executable instructions cause the client device to continue to display each of the serviced and non serviced routes as discussed above but to display an additional highlight on the selected route. This additional highlight has a different appearance than the non serviced routes and the other non selected serviced routes. For example the additional highlight may have yet another color e.g. red . This additional highlight serves to distinguish the selected route from the other non selected serviced routes as well as the non serviced routes.

In some embodiments the executable instructions cause the client device to display the serviced routes with broad indicators. These broad indicators are wider than indicators displayed for the non serviced routes. Moreover the broad indicators may have a different color e.g. white than the indicators for the non serviced routes e.g. black . In this case the additional highlight on the selected route may include a narrow indicator positioned within and or overlaid onto the corresponding broad indicator of the selected route. The narrow indicator may be yet a different color e.g. red .

In view of the above modifications and variations those skilled in the art will appreciate that the server in more generally sends executable instructions that cause the client device to display selected routes with a combination of different indicators. That is in general the executable instructions cause the client device to display serviced routes with a first indicator and to display non serviced routes with a second indicator. The first indicator has a first appearance and the second indicator has a second appearance that is different than the first appearance.

With the routes displayed in this way the client device may be configured to receive user input regarding a selected location within the geographic area that lies on a first route of the serviced routes. Responsive to such user input the executable instructions cause the client device to display the first route with a combination of the first indicator and a third indicator. This combination of the first and third indicators has a third appearance that is different than the first and second appearances. Moreover such display of the first route may occur while the client device is still displaying the remainder of the serviced routes with the first indicator and displaying the non serviced routes with the second indicator.

Similar to previous embodiments the first indicator may be a broad stripe and the third indicator may be a narrow line positioned within and or overlaid onto an interior space of the broad stripe. The third indicator may also have a different color e.g. red than the first indicator e.g. white .

The remaining Figures illustrate various aspects of the systems and methods of displaying route information. These maps displayed on the screen are directed to a bus route system for transporting people around a geographic area. This is one example of use for displaying the maps. These aspects are applicable to a large variety of other contexts of use as described above.

The background information provides a context for the route information . The background information may include geographic aspects of the area including lakes rivers mountains deserts. The background information may also include general topographic features such as hills valleys elevation etc. The background information may also include town names road names and special features e.g. airport park stadium .

The route information includes routes with serviced and non serviced routes that extend through the geographic area. The system generally identifies the serviced routes by route husks and the non serviced routes by different indicators. In these route husks are represented as broad lines positioned over the routes that are serviced by buses. The route husks may be highlighted on the map to facilitate viewing by the user. Route husks in are positioned over North Road 1st Road First Street and X Court.

The non serviced routes are displayed with different indicators than the serviced routes. For example Jones Rd is a non serviced route and has a different appearance than the service routes. This conveys to the user that the bus system does not service every route within the area but rather that just a finite number of routes include bus service.

The map on the display may include the different information in different colors. For example the route husks may be displayed in one or more colors and the non serviced routes and background information displayed in one or more different colors. In one specific embodiment the route husks are displayed in white the majority of geography is displayed in gray the non serviced routes are displayed in yellow or black the special features are display in green and the lakes and rivers are displayed in blue. Various other color schemes may be used to highlight the various pieces of information.

The map on the display of provides a first level of detail of the background and route information . The amount of information is displayed in a clean format that preferably does not include overlapping names or finite detail such as smaller routes or buildings that would cause the map to be cluttered and confusing to the user. For example the routes illustrated within Easy Loop at the town of Oakville only include their basic positioning. This is necessary to prevent overlap of information or too much information being displayed within a limited space on the map each of which would be difficult for the user to comprehend.

The first level of detail includes basic aspects of the background and route information . The system may include more specific information that is not initially displayed for the purpose of keeping the map filled with relevant information. In one embodiment each of the serviced routes available to the user is identified by route husks . This allows the user to know their options for taking a bus to the various geographic regions. In other embodiments more detailed bus routes are not displayed by husks at this basic level.

The system is configured to receive input that directs the system to display more detailed background and or route information. For example the system may include a cursor that is movable over the map at the direction of the user. The user may move the cursor using any number of input devices including for example a mouse a keyboard a touch screen voice recognition or the like. Responsive to the user moving i.e. hovering the cursor over a specific piece of information on the map the system displays additional detail regarding that piece of information. The system may alternatively require a mouse click or other affirmative action when the cursor is positioned over the specific piece of information before displaying additional detail.

Different types of user input may direct the system to display different levels of detail. Consider for example an embodiment where a mouse controls movement of the cursor over the map. The mouse further includes input buttons. The system displays additional detail after the user moves the cursor over a specific route husk and displays yet further detail once the user clicks one or more of the mouse s input buttons.

The route husks illustrate the routes that are serviced by the bus system. Initially each of the route husks has the same visual appearance as illustrated in . This provides the user with an overview of the various bus route options for travel. The system includes a route reveal feature that displays each bus route that extends through a specific location selected by the user. This allows the user to know options for bus routes at a particular location.

The route reveal feature displays the entirety of each of the bus routes that service the specific location inputted by the user. When a user selects a location serviced by multiple bus routes each of the routes will be displayed in their entirety. The separate bus routes are displayed in different manners to allow differentiation. This may include the different bus routes displayed in different colors and or with different symbols.

Bus routes that extend along the same route husks may be displayed in different ways. The system may use an interleaving pattern along the shared sections. Using the example of the bus routes are displayed in an interleaving pattern along the shared segment which includes 1Rd. The specific interleaving pattern may vary. includes the symbols representing the bus routes directly alternating with the symbol for the first bus route followed by the symbol for the second bus route . Other interleaving patterns may include two or more of each symbol followed by two or more of a second symbol. Aspects of displaying routes in an interleaving pattern are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 920 967 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The sections of the bus routes that are not shared are illustrated with just the corresponding bus route symbol.

The shared segment may also be displayed with the different bus route symbols positioned in a side by side arrangement. The shared segment may also be displayed with a different symbol than either of the individual symbols. This may include a different color for the shared segment.

The system may further be configured to display a palette with more detailed bus route information when an input is received from the user. include the palette located in an upper corner of the map away from the selected route . The palette may also be located at other positions on the map or may be movable by the user within the map in the event it initially covers information relevant to the user. Further the system does not display the palette and associated information on the map until requested by the user. This ensures that more specific levels of information are not initially displayed until a request is entered by the user.

The palette includes additional information about the selected bus route . In some embodiments the palette is displayed at the same time that the bus route is highlighted within the map. The system may for example be configured to display the palette based on the same input that highlights the selected bus route . In other embodiments the system requires a second input to display the palette i.e. a first input highlights the selected bus route and a second input displays the palette .

The system is configured to remove the palette and identified bus route from the map. Removal may include the user moving the cursor over one of the aspects within the palette as illustrated in . Placing the cursor in the palette over a particular bus route highlights the corresponding information. Further a remove aspect is illustrated in the palette . The user can move the cursor over the aspect and select an input that causes the bus route information to be removed from the palette . This also causes the bus route to no longer be highlighted in the route husks . This removal feature allows the user to remove bus route information once it is no longer needed. The system may also remove specific bus route information from the palette and or route husks after a predetermined period of time.

The palette includes bus route information on the various bus routes highlighted in the route husks . As illustrated in the palette includes information about each of the two bus routes that are highlighted in the husks . The system is configured for the user to select additional bus routes on the husks which will also be highlighted on the husks and included in the palette . The individual bus routes may be removed from palette and from being highlighted when an input command is received while the cursor is on the aspect as discussed above. In this manner a user may simultaneously review multiple different routes of interest. If the map becomes too cluttered the user can remove excessive bus routes as necessary.

When multiple bus routes are displayed in the palette the system is further configured to highlight a single one of the bus routes . This is accomplished by the user moving the cursor over the specific bus route in the palette . Using as an example the cursor is moved over the first bus route in the palette e.g. Mapleton Airport . In one method the user simply moves the cursor over the desired bus route. In another method the user is also required to enter an input command while the cursor is over the bus route. This causes the system to highlight just the selected bus route on the route husks in the display . The system may remove the other bus route e.g. Oakville Airport from the corresponding husks or may just further emphasize the selected route while the other route remains displayed on the husks . One method includes the selected route displayed in a blinking fashion with the other routes being statically displayed.

If the selected route from the palette has a shared segment with another route from the palette the system may only display the selected route along the shared segment. This is illustrated in a comparison of and . This results in the shared segment changing from an interleaving pattern as illustrated in to just the selected route as illustrated in .

In the various methods the system clearly highlights the desired route to bring it to the attention of the user.

The system emphasizes a particular bus route when the cursor remains positioned over the corresponding route information in the palette . Moving the cursor away from the routes in the palette results in each of the bus routes being displayed in the map with an equal emphasis.

The system displays a more detailed map when the user limits the area. The smaller area allows the system to display more detailed information within the space allocated in the display . Despite the size of the area the system may include each of the bus routes that service the area. This enables the user to see the available options while viewing each of the various maps.

The larger views of the overall area may include a display with a first scale. One example is one inch of the map equating to 10 miles. include maps at this first scale. Based on the broad information at this broad level the user is able to drill down to obtain more detailed information. The user is able to focus on a smaller geographic area to obtain more detailed information about serviced routes in the smaller area. includes an example with a map having a smaller scale e.g. one inch equating to 1 mile . This closer view allows for the display to include more detail than is available in the larger scale. Detailed features such a gas station G hospital H mall city hall and police station P are included in the map. Further additional non serviced routes that extend throughout the area are included in the map.

Bus stops are another detail that can be displayed on the map by the system. The bus stops are illustrated along the various husks and indicate where the user can catch one of the buses that service the area. illustrates one example with the bus stops displayed as circles on the route husks . In one specific example the bus stops are displayed in white while the remainder of the information is illustrated in one or more different colors.

The system provides this next level of detail in a manner that is clean to be easily comprehended by the user. The exact amount of detail is based on the scale of the map selected by the user. The system does not display additional information until requested by the user. This ensures the map does not initially include superfluous information that is not relevant to the user.

In some embodiments the bus routes are highlighted along the corresponding husks when the palette is displayed on the map. Other embodiments include highlighting the bus routes after an additional input from the user. includes the specific bus route being highlighted as a result of the user moving the cursor over the information in the palette . The selected route is highlighted without any additional information being displayed on the map which again allows the user to focus on the relevant information without being overwhelmed by extra non relevant information.

Further information may be displayed as desired by the user. In one embodiment as illustrated in moving the cursor over one or more of the agency and corresponding route number causes a full name of the bus route to be displayed. In the embodiment of moving the cursor over the agency results in the name of the agency Transit Authority and the name of the bus route Middle Loop to be displayed. Other embodiments may include displaying just the bus route. In the various embodiments the display of the full name may occur simultaneously with highlighting of the bus route on the map.

The system may further display the route information according to the different agencies that service the area represented in the map. This may be beneficial for a user who has a bus pass for a single agency and desires to know possible travel options.

The system is configured to display the corresponding bus routes for a particular agency based on input from the user. In one embodiment moving the cursor over the desired aspect in the palette causes just the bus routes for that particular agency displayed as husks on the map.

In another embodiment all the routes remain displayed with the husks of the selected routes being displayed in a larger format than the husks of the non selected routes . By way of example the selected routes may be displayed with a first width and the non selected routes may be displayed with a narrower second width. This difference allows for particular routes to be emphasized using size relationships instead of color or lighting. illustrates an embodiment of the different size relationship. The husks of the routes serviced by the selected Agency are displayed in a wider format. In the specific embodiment of this includes the BART agency that services North Road and 1Road. The husks of the other non selected routes are also displayed but in a narrower format. In the example of this includes the routes serviced by the DART TA and Star agencies.

When completed the user can move the cursor away from the selected agency which causes the highlighted routes to be removed from the map. The user may then move the cursor to another agency aspect to see their bus routes highlighted on the map. In one embodiment this occurs when the user clicks on the agency aspect . Other embodiments may include using a checkbox or a lock icon. This will keep these routes highlighted when the cursor is removed from the aspect . This may also allow the user to select another agency to highlight their bus routes simultaneously on the display . Any routes that overlap may be illustrated in an interleaving pattern or otherwise indicate that they are shared by multiple agencies.

The system may be configured to include in the palette just the agencies that service the area included in the map. Therefore reducing the area of the map or panning the map to a different geographic region may increase or decrease the number of agency options. By way of example includes the display with a map illustrating a relatively large geographic area. This large geographic region is serviced by a first number of agencies. includes a specific example of four agencies DART BART TA and Star .

The palette may also display the various indicators in a manner that corresponds to their position within the map. includes an embodiment with the agencies aspects located in the pallet roughly according to the geographic areas that they serve. In this example the Star agency is positioned to the upper left of the palette that corresponds to the town of Mapleton which is their main service area. The BART agency is positioned in the lower central section of the palette that corresponds to the Silver Lake area of the map. The TA agency is located in a position that corresponds to the Airport which is their main service area. Likewise the DART agency is located to the right of the palette to indicate the agency serves the Oakville region. The correlation on the display between the positional layouts for the palette and map assists the user in quickly and accurately obtaining information from the system.

In another embodiment as illustrated in the agency aspects are not be constrained to a palette . Rather they float along the outer edges of the display while maintaining their relative positions to the geographic area.

The positional layouts of the palette may change when the display changes due to panning to a different geographic region or altering the size of the map that is on the display. The change in the layout of the agency aspects occurs because the geographic area viewed by the user changes. Using the example of as an example panning the display towards Mapleton and away from Oakville i.e. panning to the left in will cause the aspects in the palette to also shift. In this specific embodiment this will cause the DART aspect to be removed from the palette because this agency does not service the geographic area on the map DART agency only services the Oakville area which is no longer displayed . The other three agency aspects TA BART Star will shift to the right of the palette to maintain their correlation with the areas they service on the map .

The visual appearance of the agency aspects in the palette may be based on a percentage of the serviced routes for each agency. In one embodiment the amount of serviced routes for each agency in the current display is determined. The total amount of serviced routes in the display is also determined as an accumulation of the serviced routes of each agency. The percentage of serviced routes for each agency is determined by dividing the amount of serviced routes for each agency by the total amount of serviced routes. The aspects for the various agencies are then displayed in the palette based on the individual percentages. Agencies with larger percentages may be displayed in a more prominent manner than other lesser servicing agencies. This may include displaying the larger agencies before the lesser agencies e.g. in descending order displaying the agencies indicators in different sizes and displaying the agency indicators in highlights or different colors.

An example of the percentage of the total route network can be illustrated using the display of . For purposes of this example the DART agency services 50 miles in the display the BART agency services 25 miles the TA agency services 15 miles and the Star agency services 10 miles. The agency aspects are displayed with the DART agency being most prominent because this agency services the most amount of routes i.e. 50 followed by the BART agency at 25 TA agency at 15 and the Star agency at 10 .

The percentage of the total route network will change as the display changes due to panning or changing the display size. This will cause corresponding changes in the display of the aspects . The system may be configured to dynamically calculate the percentages and dynamically change the aspects accordingly.

In another embodiment the system displays an agency indicator based on the percentage of the agency s total serviced routes that are currently in the display . By way of example an agency may service a total of 100 miles of routes with a current display including 30 miles of the serviced routes . The agency s aspect in the palette would indicate a setting of 30 i.e. 30 100 . Agencies with larger percentages may be displayed in a more meaningful manner than other lesser agencies.

These percentages again will change dynamically as the user pans and zooms. In one embodiment the agency s aspect will have different appearances depending upon the amount of their serviced routes currently in the display . In one embodiment an agency s indicator may fade or become transparent corresponding to how much of their route network has disappeared as the user zooms or pans the display. By way of example an initial display may include 50 of an agency s route network. The agency aspect may have an initial brightness when the view includes 50 of their route network. This percentage decreases as the user pans away from the geographic area serviced by the agency. The brightness of the indicator may gradually lessen as the user pans away from the agency s network and ultimately the indicator disappears from the display when none of the serviced routes are included in the display. Similar embodiments may vary the size of the indicator depending upon the percentage.

The system may also display on the lap targets moving along the various routes . The system may just include the targets for the routes selected by the user. includes an embodiment with the targets positioned at various locations along the selected routes . In the embodiment of the targets represent buses. Other applications may include the different targets as discussed above.

Tracking the location of targets as they move around the various routes may be provided using a number of technologies. In one embodiment a Global Positioning System GPS tracking system is used. GPS uses a network of satellites to triangulate the position of a receiver and provide position coordinates. To that end the targets may each be provided with a GPS receiver device that works in conjunction with the satellites to determine a current position often in terms of a latitude and longitude coordinate set for the target . The current position of each target is updated within the GPS receiver device through communications with the satellites.

Other means of determining the position of the targets may be used. One example includes using accelerometers to calculate distances traveled based upon time and acceleration values. Another similar technique uses dead reckoning as a process of estimating a global position of the target by advancing a known position using course speed time and distance traveled. Another embodiment includes equipping the target with a tracking device that permits location tracking using a more passive approach. For instance the target may comprise a node button or tag such as an RFID tags that may be tracked by a geographic information system.

Regardless of the method used to determine a current position the data representative of the position of the target is transmitted to a tracking server. In one embodiment the target is provided with a mobile communications device that permits data transmission to and from a communications station. In one embodiment the mobile communications device is able to send transmissions but not receive transmissions. The communications station may comprise a transceiver e.g. tower and a base station. The base station comprises the necessary hardware software to convert the received wireless data which may be cellular circuit switched or packet switched data to a suitable data protocol for transmission over a network such as the Internet.

Examples of tracking the locations of targets along routes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 920 967 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The ability of the system to track the location of targets along the routes provides additional information that may be relevant to the user. The system is able to display the expected arrival time of various targets relative to various points along the routes . In one example the system can display the expected arrival time of a bus to a particular bus stop . Using as an example after the user selects a particular bus stop the system can display the expected time when the bus will arrive at the particular bus stop.

The system may be configured to receive inputs by moving a cursor over a particular point of interest on the map. In areas on the map that include more detail the cursor may need to be positioned directly over the particular area. By way of example using the areas that include multiple different route husks around the town of Oakville may require that the cursor be positioned directly on the particular route husk prior to the system displaying additional information. In other areas that are not so congested the system may display the additional information when the cursor is in the area of the particular point. Again using as an example the area around the airport may require that the cursor be positioned in the vicinity of 1Rd. for the system to display the additional information. This sensitivity setting may vary across the display and further may be adjusted by the user as necessary.

The system may be configured for the user to select the desired sensitivity or size of the affected area around the cursor . The size is a selected number of pixels around a selected point represented by the cursor . As the cursor is moved around the display additional information that that is within the area of affect will be displayed.

The system may be configured for the user to select the desired area of affect of the cursor . The options may include narrow for a relatively small area of affect medium and wide. The options may also allow the user to specifically set the size of the pixel radius that defines the area of affect.

The systems and methods may be configured to receive various types of input. One type of input is from the user. Examples of a user input include signals from a keyboard mouse or touch screen. Another type of input may be a location input based on the geographic location of the device . The device may include a navigational receiver to determine its geographic position. The navigational receiver may include a GPS system as described above. The location input may also be determined based on an accelerometer dead reckoning or an RFID tag associated with the device . This geographic position functions as an input used by the system to reveal relevant route information in proximity to the location of the device . More detailed route information may be displayed upon the receipt of a user input. The location input may be useful in applications where the device is a mobile terminal such as a hand held device that is carried by the user or a device mounted in the user s vehicle.
