title: Configuration based service availability analysis of AMF managed systems
abstract: An Availability Management Framework (AMF) configuration describes how configuration entities of a highly available system are grouped and includes information on service provision and service protection policies against resource failure. The AMF configuration defines a set of failure types for each component and each node, and specifies a failure rate and a recommended recovery for each failure type. A method for evaluating service availability receives the AMF configuration as input, and analyzes it to obtain an actual recovery that the highly available system is to perform when the given component fails. The method maps the AMF configuration to a stochastic model that captures the dependencies among the components and among the configuration entities at multiple levels of the hierarchy. The method utilizes the model to calculate the service availability of the AMF configuration based on the failure rate, the actual recovery and the dependencies.
