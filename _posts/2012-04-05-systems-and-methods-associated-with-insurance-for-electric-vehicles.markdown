This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 471 878 entitled Systems and Methods Associated with Insurance for Electric Vehicles filed on Apr. 5 2011. The entire contents of that application are incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments relate to insurance processing systems and methods. More particularly embodiments relate to the provision of insurance processing for electric vehicles.

The use of electric vehicles has recently increased and is expected to continue to grow in the near future. While electric vehicles may provide economic and or environmental benefits some drivers may have concerns regarding the use of alternative fuels. For example the locations of charging stations the distances that can be traveled without running out of power and or the appropriate maintenance schedules associated with electric vehicles may be unfamiliar to drivers. This may be especially true for drivers who are new to the electric vehicle experience. Similarly businesses may be uncomfortable when introducing electric vehicles into an existing fleet of automobiles.

Existing automobile insurance products may provide a level of comfort to drivers with respect to personal injury costs and or property damage e.g. damage to an automobile in the event of an accident . It would be desirable to provide information to electric vehicle drivers and or owners to reassure them regarding some of the new aspects associated with the technology. Moreover more data may be available regarding the use of electric vehicles as compared to traditional gasoline powered automobiles e.g. an electric vehicle identifier might be transmitted to a charging station . It may therefore further be desirable to provide more accurate and current data about an electric vehicle to an insurance provider and or to a driver or owner of the electric vehicle. Further still it may be desirable to monitor or identify driving patterns associated with certain electric vehicle drivers to allow those drivers to receive discounts or other benefits based on desirable charging patterns.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and methods associated with insurance products for electric vehicles. While electric vehicles may provide economic and or environmental benefits some drivers may have concerns regarding the use of alternative fuels. For example the locations of charging stations the distances that can be traveled without running out of power and or the appropriate maintenance schedules associated with electric vehicles may be unfamiliar to drivers.

To address such concerns illustrates an insurance system according to some embodiments. In particular an insurance platform may exchange information with one or more electric vehicles . As used herein the phrase electric vehicle may refer to any vehicle that is at least partially powered by electricity including a hybrid electric vehicle a Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle PHEV or a Battery Electric Vehicle BEV .

According to some embodiments the insurance platform may exchange information directly with the electric vehicle e.g. via a wireless communication network . According to other embodiments the insurance platform may exchange information about the electric vehicle via a charging station or via a mobile device e.g. associated with a driver or payment provider . The information about the electric vehicle might include for example a driver or vehicle identifier a location e.g. of a charging station a time of day and or date and or maintenance information. The insurance platform may then use the information about the electric vehicle and or information from one or more insurance databases in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein.

According to some embodiments the automated insurance platform may transmit an integrated insurance electric vehicle display to a driver. As used herein the term automated may refer to for example actions that can be performed with little or no human intervention. By way of example only the insurance platform may be associated and or communicate with a Personal Computer PC an enterprise server or a database farm. As used herein devices including those associated with the insurance platform and any other device described herein may exchange information via any communication network including one or more of a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN a Wide Area Network WAN a proprietary network a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN a Wireless Application Protocol WAP network a Bluetooth network a wireless LAN network and or an Internet Protocol IP network such as the Internet an intranet or an extranet. Note that any devices described herein may communicate via one or more such communication networks.

Note that the insurance platform may be associated with various types of insurance policies including personal insurance business insurance and wealth management offerings including property and casualty insurance life insurance retirement and education investment products and group benefits offerings. Moreover although a single insurance platform is shown in any number of such devices may be included. Moreover various devices described herein might be combined according to embodiments of the present invention. For example in some embodiments the insurance platform and insurance databases might be co located and or may comprise a single apparatus.

The process may be performed to facilitate the distribution of information associated with insurance goods and or services. Pursuant to some embodiments electric vehicle information including electric vehicle charging information may be received at S. The electric vehicle information may be received for example from an electric charging station the electric vehicle and or a mobile payment device e.g. a payment card cobranded with an insurance company . The electric charging information might for example include a geographic location of an electric charging station an amount of electric charge provided for the electric vehicle a date and time a driver identifier an electric vehicle identifier an insurance policy identifier and or a cost associated with an electric charge provided for the electric vehicle.

At S the electric vehicle charging information may be associated with automobile insurance premium information. For example an insurance platform may correlate the charging information with one or more pre existing insurance policy identifiers. According to some embodiments the automobile insurance premium information is associated with a fleet of electric vehicles operated by an enterprise and the automobile insurance premium information may be associated with business income interruption loss insurance. According to other embodiments the automobile insurance premium information is further associated with maintenance information for the electric vehicle. According to still other embodiments the automobile insurance premium information is further associated with a roadside assistance program for the electric vehicle and or at least one shared neighborhood electric vehicle.

At S an integrated presentation of the electric vehicle charging information and automobile insurance premium information may be transmitted for presentation to an owner of the electric vehicle. The transmitting may be for example associated an electric charging station the electric vehicle a mobile payment device and or a communication address associated with an owner of the electric vehicle e.g. a home address or email address .

The process of may be performed by any suitable device or apparatus. is one example of an insurance platform according to some embodiments. The insurance platform may be for example associated with the system . The insurance platform comprises a processor such as one or more commercially available Central Processing Units CPUs in the form of one chip microprocessors coupled to a communication device configured to communicate via a communication network not shown in . The communication device may be used to communicate for example with one or more remote charging stations electric vehicles or mobile payment devices. The insurance platform further includes an input device e.g. a mouse and or keyboard to enter insurance or electric vehicle information and an output device e.g. a computer monitor to display aggregated electric vehicle reports and or results to an administrator .

The processor also communicates with a storage device . The storage device may comprise any appropriate information storage device including combinations of magnetic storage devices e.g. a hard disk drive optical storage devices and or semiconductor memory devices. The storage device stores a program and or insurance engine for controlling the processor . The processor performs instructions of the programs and thereby operates in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. For example the processor may receive electric vehicle information including electric vehicle charging information. The processor may then associate the electric vehicle charging information with automobile insurance premium information. The automobile insurance premium information may be associated with for example any type of insurance product offered for an electric vehicle. The processor may then transmit over the communications network an integrated presentation of the electric vehicle charging information and the automobile insurance premium information for presentation to an owner of the electric vehicle. For example illustrates an integrated insurance charging display for driver Jane Doe according to some embodiments described herein.

Referring again to the programs may be stored in a compressed uncompiled and or encrypted format. The programs may furthermore include other program elements such as an operating system a database management system and or device drivers used by the processor to interface with peripheral devices.

As used herein information may be received by or transmitted to for example i the insurance platform from another device or ii a software application or module within the insurance platform from another software application module or any other source.

In some embodiments such as shown in the storage device stores an insurance database . An example of a database that may be used in connection with the insurance platform will now be described in detail with respect to . Note that the database described herein is only one example and additional and or different information may be stored therein. Moreover various databases might be split or combined in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein.

Referring to a table is shown that represents the insurance database that may be stored at the insurance platform according to some embodiments. The table may include for example entries identifying insurance products that may be offered in connection with electric vehicles. The table may also define fields for each of the entries. The fields may according to some embodiments specify a policy identifier a vehicle a last charge location a last charge date time and amount and a vehicle type . The information in the insurance database may be created and updated for example whenever data is received from remote insurance agent devices and or charging stations.

The policy may be for example a unique alphanumeric code identifying an insurance product for a particular electric vehicle and or driver. The vehicle identifier may be for example associated with a particular electric vehicle and may for example corresponding to an identifier received from a charging station or payment device. The last charge location might for example be an address or other geographic code indicating where the electric vehicle received a charge. Although a single charge is illustrated in in actually a log of charges would likely be maintained in the database .

The last charge date time and amount may indicate when the charge was provided to the electric vehicle along with the cost of the charge. According to some embodiments payments associated with the insurance policy and payments associated with electric charges may be merged or otherwise combined. For example a driver might make a small insurance payment each time he or she charges an electric vehicle via a single payment platform e.g. credit card or utility bill payments .

The vehicle type may indicate for example that the insurance policy is associated with a personal vehicle a fleet of electric vehicles or a shared neighborhood or community vehicle.

In the case of a personal insurance policy an insurance provider branded payment card e.g. associated with a charging station might provide electric vehicle drivers with auto insurance along with other value added services. For example a driver might swipe a single card to charge an electric vehicle at home and at public stations that are part of the ChargePoint network. The card may have the option to be pre loaded so that drivers can pay by the charge. Thus every time a driver fills up an electric vehicle he or she can simply deduct a pre determined amount that shows up on the monthly insurance bill. For drivers that use such a pre pay option additional benefits may be available e.g. for free fill ups based on driving habits loyalty etc.

According to any of the embodiments described herein an insurance policy and or electric vehicle may be associated with a preferred access to a charging station. For example a driver might use a mobile phone application to reserve a spot at a particular charging station and or at a particular date and time.

In addition to bundling insurance and vehicle charging information in such a package an insurance provider might also offer other services to electric vehicle drivers. For example if a driver is stranded due to charge depletion in their electric vehicle he or she might call a pre approved roadside assistance number provided on the back of the payment card. The phone number might coordinate a service truck to either complete a quick charge of the vehicle or tow the vehicle home to charge at a convenient location. The card may also provide drivers with access to other electric vehicles drivers through an online green community as well as electric vehicle experts at pre certified maintenance shops. Moreover the insurance provider might offer branded loaner cars e.g. for five days a year via a car rental or car sharing company. These loaners might for example be used when a driver wants to make a long trip.

According to some embodiments the driver s auto insurance vehicle charges maintenance and roadside assistance may all be captured transparently on a single bill from an insurance provider. In some embodiments an insurance provider might interact with a driver at a point of sale. For example when a driver buys an electric vehicle he or she may be provided with marketing material describing a Complete EV Package option. If the driver signs up to be insured by the provider they might also receive a co branded charging card that can be used immediately at any ChargePoint station.

By simplifying the process and attracting early electric vehicle adopters the insurance provider may strengthen its brand with drivers. Additionally by providing an option to pay for charging by the mile the provider may obtain location information about where the car is located during the day based on where the driver charges and or how many miles are driven for potential risk assessment. As an additional benefit cash back free charge ups and or additional benefits may be provided for free each year a driver is not in an accident.

By way of example a driver might consider purchasing a new zero emission electric vehicle. The driver is interested in the vehicle but still has some range anxiety and is unfamiliar with the maintenance process charging infrastructure and billing in the electric vehicle ecosystem including changes to his auto insurance policy . Such a driver may be interested in having a one stop shop where he or she can have all of his electric vehicle services maintained by a single company.

In addition to personal automobile insurance policies some embodiments described herein may be associated with business policies such as those covering a fleet of vehicles. In this case an insurance provider may offer an add on option for business automobile policies that have electric vehicles within their commercial fleets. For example a business owner might purchase an add on to their current auto insurance coverage that provides them with specialty coverage in connection with their electric vehicles. The optional policy might not only give them standard business income interruption loss coverage but also provide rental reimbursement and delivery maintenance servicing for towing vehicle charging or infrastructure fixes and or property damage coverage if the charging stations or car batteries cause damage to a building or vehicle.

According to some embodiments a co branded charging card package may provide fleet business managers with a phone service line that will take care of interruption losses streamline the process of getting to approved rental agencies e.g. agencies that will drive rental cars to the business location and or schedule towing or maintenance appointments on site e.g. to conduct fast charges of vehicles or to update infrastructure components .

By way of example a fleet manager at a delivery service business decides to convert some of his or her old fleet of light trucks to electric vehicles. The manager knows that the total range of his or her drivers is unpredictable at times but each driver definitely travels less than 50 miles per day. Such a manager may be less worried about the range of the new electric vehicles especially if the business has charging stations at the warehouse for nightly fill ups . The manager still may be concerned however about business income interruption losses in the event that the charging stations break there is a power outage and or the vehicle batteries fail to function properly. Since deliveries still need to be made in these situations the security of the services described herein may be useful.

According to other embodiments free or reduced cost electric vehicle products e.g. a car and a charger might be provided to certain target demographic members. For example an insurance provider may offer additional electric vehicle services and products for drivers that become insured with a particular electric vehicle auto policy. Specifically the provider may offer certain drivers e.g. retirees living at a particular retirement community college students living on campus or customers of a shared vehicle program such as the Zipcar service an integrated billing system that includes existing insurance policies if any a new discounted policy for a neighborhood electric vehicle and an electric fill up for the community electric vehicle on a monthly basis. A co branded charging station may allow drivers to swipe a key card for fill ups. These charges may be wrapped together with the driver s automobile insurance in a monthly statement from the insurance provider. Additional features and services might also be provided for safer drivers.

By way of example an older couple may live in a retirement community with other retirees. Even though they are retired they have an active lifestyle and may be interested in a vehicle to travel around the community. In this case a shared neighborhood electric vehicle may be provided for the entire community. By using the insurer provided charging station and electric vehicle the community may also be provided with an integrated billing system that includes a club membership auto insurance and or monthly vehicle charging fees.

Note that according to some embodiments the location of an electric vehicle and or an amount of travel associated with an electric vehicle may be determined based on information about when and where the electric vehicle is charged. Further note that such information may be helpful when determining insurance risk factors associated with the vehicle. For example features of some embodiments will now be described by first referring to where a network for providing electric vehicle insurance information pursuant to some embodiments is shown. As depicted network includes a number of devices which together operate to generate store and utilize loss risk scores for use in informing drivers and in insurance processing. Network includes an insurance processing system with a scoring engine that generates loss risk scores that may be provided to a number of drivers such as drivers operating electric vehicles such as those described in conjunction with other user devices such as personal computers mobile phones or the like and vehicle devices such as charging stations navigation systems or the like . The loss risk scores may be associated with driver or vehicle behavior e.g. to identify driving patterns which present a relatively low or high risk and or insurance premiums.

Data may be provided from electric vehicles user devices and vehicle devices e.g. including charging stations to update data used by the scoring engine to improve the accuracy and relevancy of scoring data. Pursuant to some embodiments insurance processing system includes a scoring engine which operates on historical loss data and loss related data from other data sources such as public data sources and commercial data sources to generate loss risk scores that indicate a relative loss risk. In some embodiments the loss risk scores and data used to generate the loss risk scores are geocoded to create a loss risk index that represents the relative risk of loss in different geographical locations. Pursuant to some embodiments address and location data may expressed or geocoded as a location or geocode given in latitude and longitude using standard decimal degrees notation for the latitudes and longitudes although other spatial and locational data may also be used to code and tag data associated with the present invention.

In some embodiments the geocoding or tagging may include identifying specific types of locations such as electric vehicle charging stations or the like so that loss risk scores and other information may be associated with those locations. In some embodiments system includes a geocoding engine which operates on received data to express the data as a location. For example the geocoding engine may be used on address data received from an insurance application claim or other information and translate or express the address as a latitude and longitude. The engine may also append other location related data to the address data to provide additional location information to the data. The geocoded data may then be stored used as an input to the scoring engine or presented to a user device e.g. such as an electric vehicle etc. for use e.g. such as by presenting the data in a map format or overlay .

Any of a number of different algorithms may be used to generate the loss risk scores and the loss risk index. In some embodiments the historical loss data and other input data sources are selected based on variables that have a high correlation to loss. The loss risk scores and the loss risk index may be generated using statistical modeling techniques such as by performing computations using discrete scores that are weighted in nonlinear combination e.g. such as based on the likelihood of a loss in a given geographical location or geocode . In some embodiments the generation of the loss risk scores and index may be performed by sampling data including historical loss data normalizing the data generating a scoring model and verifying and updating the model. In some embodiments the model may be updated based on actual loss data received from mobile devices and from other sources. In some embodiments the scoring may be shared among a number of insurance entities e.g. such as a consortium or group of insurance companies and historical and current loss data may be provided from those entities to create a more accurate and predictive score.

As a specific example which is provided for illustration but not limitation the system of the invention operates on data to generate loss risk scores that are associated with the likelihood of an electric vehicle loss. In such an example implementation the following types of data may be used as inputs to the scoring engine i data from historical loss data including historical data associated with collision losses historical data associated with theft losses and historical data associated with personal injury losses ii data from public data sources including census and demographic data e.g. such as population density crime statistics emergency call data highway and road construction data and iii data from commercial data sources e.g. such as data from other insurers regarding losses theft data from sources such as LoJack or OnStar and traffic and traffic density data from sources such as EZ Pass or the like . This data may further be enhanced or updated using data from users operating electric vehicles other user devices and vehicle devices e.g. such as electric vehicle charging stations .

A number of algorithms may be used to generate loss risk scores pursuant to some embodiments. As one illustrative but not limiting example a loss risk score may be calculated using the following general function Loss Risk Score 

Pursuant to some embodiments the function generates a Loss Risk Score which is a score for a specific location or geocode associated with a charging station. The Loss Risk Score may be a representation of a general loss risk range. For example in some embodiments loss risk tiers may be represented as color codes such as green for low risk orange for normal risk and red for higher risk. As another example the loss risk tiers may be represented as alphabetical grades or scores e.g. such as A for low risk B for normal risk and C for higher risk . Other representations may include tiers based on percentages or other representations of the relative risk of a geocode or location.

In the formula depicted above the variable P represents the Average Claims or Loss Severity for a particular geocode or area associated with a charging station. The variable Q represents the Average Claims or Loss Frequency for that geocode or area. The variable R represents a Weather Risk factor e.g. representing adverse weather conditions such as a snowstorm rain storm hurricane etc. and the variable S represents a Time of Day risk factor e.g. associated with a time of day such as rush hour night time etc. The variable T represents a Day Risk Factor e.g. such as a particular day of the week holiday etc. and the variable U represents a Traffic Condition Risk factor e.g. such as a current traffic condition for a particular geocode or location . The variable V represents a User Generated risk factor based on for example inputs received from people reporting or identifying dangerous events or conditions using their mobile devices . The variable W represents a Crime Risk factor e.g. such as a risk of car thefts or property damage . The variable Y represents a People or Vehicle risk factor e.g. based on population density information . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other variables and inputs may be provided to generate a risk score that has a high correlation to the risk of loss in a particular location or geocode associated with a charging station. Each of the variables may be based on data received substantially in real time from a number of different sources. Individual risk factors will only be used in applicable jurisdictions as allowed by law.

Pursuant to some embodiments an Electric Vehicle or Person Risk score may also be calculated using a formula such as the following Electric Vehicle or Person Risk Score C Where the Electric Vehicle or Person Risk Score is a score for a particular person or electric vehicle or group of persons or electric vehicles over a period of time based on cumulative trips taken during that period of time. For example a person who during the course of the year 2015 spends much of their time charging his or her electric automobile at high risk geocodes may be assigned a Person Risk Score of red or some other indicator of high risk based for 7010. In the Electric Vehicle or Person Risk Score formula shown above the variable m is the percentage of the total distance taken through or in geocodes having a Loss Risk Score of A low risk n is the percentage of the total distance taken through or in geocodes having a Loss Risk Score of B normal risk and p is the percentage of the total distance traveled in or through geocodes having a Loss Risk Score of C high risk .

Each of these risk scores may be used in providing information to users operating electric vehicles as well as in providing insurance services including in the pricing and underwriting of insurance policies. In some embodiments the risk scores may be generated and used by an insurance processing system .

Insurance processing system may be operated by or on behalf of an insurance company that issues insurance policies associated with the type of risk scored by the scoring engine . For example in the situation where the scoring engine is used to score vehicle or automobile types of loss risks the insurance processing system may be operated by an automobile insurer. In some embodiments some or all of the components of the system may be operated by or on behalf of other entities. For example in some embodiments the system may be operated by a device manufacturer e.g. such as an electric vehicle manufacturer etc. in order to provide risk and driving related data to their drivers. In some embodiments some or all of the system may be operated by agents or other groups or entities in order to provide use and otherwise interact with scoring and driving data pursuant to the present invention.

Data generated by the scoring engine or received from electric vehicles user devices and or vehicle devices may be used by the insurance processing system to perform policy underwriting e.g. using underwriting systems and or claims processing e.g. using claims processing systems . For example as will be described further below automobile insurance policyholders who suffer an accident and need to submit a claim on their policy may submit claim data to the insurance processing system e.g. to trigger a notice of loss or otherwise initiate claims processing . The data received by the insurance processing system may be received via one or more application programming interfaces APIs and routed to the claims processing systems for processing. In some embodiments the data may also be routed to the scoring engine to update loss risk data e.g. to provide data about the accident the location and the nature of the claimed loss .

Pursuant to some embodiments the API may include one or more APIs that expose some or all of the scoring data to external services. For example in one embodiment an API may be provided that allows the scoring data to be merged or integrated with data from external mapping services such as Google Maps or Mapquest . In such embodiments users viewing a map displayed on an electric vehicle other user device or vehicle device may select to view an overlay or integrated display of risk data. Examples of such a view are provided and discussed further below in conjunction with . In this way users may view plan and create routes appropriate for an electric vehicle.

Pursuant to some embodiments data may be transmitted between devices using a wireless network. In some embodiments some or all of the data may be transmitted using other network communication techniques e.g. such as satellite communication RFID or the like . In some embodiments some or all of the data transmitted between devices may be encrypted or otherwise secured to prevent intrusion.

Reference is now made to which is a block diagram of an example network environment showing communication paths between an electric vehicle and the insurance processing systems as well as other devices and data sources . The electric vehicle may be for example any type of hybrid and or battery operated automobile.

The electric vehicle of can for example communicate over one or more wired and or wireless networks . As an example a wireless network can be a cellular network represented by a cell transmitter . A electric vehicle may communicate over a cellular or other wireless network and through a gateway may then communicate with a network e.g. such as the Internet or other public or private network . An access point such as access point may be provided to facilitate data and other communication access to network . The access point may be for example compliant with the 802.11g or other communication standards.

In some embodiments electric vehicle may engage in both voice and data communications over the wireless network via access point . For example the electric vehicle may be able to place or receive phone calls send and receive emails send and receive short message service SMS messages send and receive email messages access electric documents send and receive streaming media or the like over the wireless network through the access point . Similar communications may be made via the network .

In some embodiments an electric vehicle may also establish communication by other means such as for example wired connections with charging stations networks peer to peer communication with other devices e.g. using Bluetooth networking or the like etc.

The electric vehicle can for example communicate with one or more services over the networks such as service providers and the insurance processing systems described above in conjunction with . For example a locator service may provide navigation information e.g. map information location information route information and other information to the electric vehicle .

Other services may include for example other web based services e.g. such as data services or the like media services e.g. providing photo video music or other content download services e.g. allowing applications and software or the like to be downloaded etc. and insurance services such as the insurance services described further below and including for example insurance reporting driver service underwriting issuance and the like .

For example in some embodiments described herein the electric vehicle may interact with insurance processing system of to receive data associated with loss risk data generated by the scoring engine of including the Loss Risk Scores associated with a charging station. The electric vehicle may receive the loss risk data and or information about charging stations and integrate the data with a map e.g. as shown and described herein in conjunction with to allow route planning or driving in view of available charging stations. The electric vehicle may also operate to transmit insurance related data or driving data to the insurance processing system . For example in a situation where the operator of the electric vehicle is insured by the insurance company operating or associated with the insurance processing system charging information might be reported by the electric vehicle .

A number of pricing formulas may be used to incorporate the loss risk scores described above into a pricing determination. For example in one illustrative embodiment the following formula may be used Price Factor Factor Factor Factor Factor Base Rate

Where the Factor x is a number between 1.00 and 1.99 calculated from a formula using a defined set of Factor Inputs. The Factor Inputs are pre defined rating variables from a table of different classifications. The Base Rate is a monetary number used for a unit of risk coverage e.g. Base Rate for electric vehicles in State of New York or Base Rate for all private passenger vehicles in State of New York . The unit of risk coverage for a particular Base Rate could be for a broad set unit of time and place year state . Pursuant to some embodiments as risk data may be received substantially in real time or on a regular basis the unit of risk coverage for a particular Base Rate could be much more granular thanks to the dynamically changing data. For example the unit of risk coverage could be expressed as a base rate per minute and or a base rate per mile or base rate per geocode of the charging station last visited by the electric vehicle.

In the example pricing formula shown above a number of Factor Inputs may be used including for example those shown in the Table 1 below.

These pricing factors as well as the risk scoring criteria discussed herein are provided for illustrative purposes. The factors and criteria used in conjunction with any given insurer or product will be selected and used in a manner that is in conformance with any applicable laws and regulations. Pursuant to some embodiments more granular pricing may be achieved by using several non traditional pricing factors including the Person Risk Score and the Electric Vehicle Risk Score generated by the scoring engine of the present invention. Further because the data may be obtained based on actual usage patterns obtained from an electric vehicle or from charging stations in some embodiments the pricing may accurately reflect the actual loss risk associated with the usage patterns of a particular driver or electric vehicle.

Referring now to a diagram depicting a user interface is shown. The user interface may be displayed on device such as a mobile telephone PDA personal computer or the like. For example the mobile device may be an iPhone from Apple Inc. a BlackBerry from RIM a mobile phone using the Google Android operating system or the like. The user interface depicts a portion of a map showing a portion of Fairfield County in the State of Connecticut. The user interface may display the location of charging stations to a driver of an electric vehicle.

In some embodiments such as the one depicted in users operating devices such as an electric vehicle may access risk score information in order to identify a safe route or to assess the relative risk associated with different routes and or charging stations. For example Trip Risk Score maybe generated for each of the multiple route options. As shown in a user is viewing a portion of a route map. In the illustrative interface the user is viewing a route through Fairfield County Connecticut and has two route choices a surface street shown as Route 1 with a first charging stations or a freeway shown as Interstate 95 with a second charging station . The relative level of loss risk posed between the two routes and charging stations is depicted by shading or coloring. In the illustrative example the choice of Route 1 shown as item is shaded darker than the alternative route shown as item . The darker shading may indicate that the surface street which traverses a downtown area with multiple traffic issues and intersections has a higher risk of loss for electric vehicles than the alternative route. In this manner drivers operating electric vehicles may proactively choose to take routes that have lower risk of vehicle damage passenger injury or other losses.

Reference is now made to where details of an electric vehicle according to some embodiments are shown. As depicted the electric vehicle includes a number of components which may be controlled or perform functions in conjunction with one more application programs to perform the features of some embodiments.

The electric vehicle can include a memory interface one or more data processors image processors and or central processing units and a peripherals interface . The memory interface the one or more processors and or the peripherals interface can be separate components or can be integrated in one or more integrated circuits. The various components in the electric vehicle can be coupled by one or more communication buses or signal lines.

Sensors devices and subsystems can be coupled to the peripherals interface to facilitate multiple functionalities. For example a biometrics sensor an accelerometer a photoelectric device a proximity sensor a camera a wireless communication unit and an audio unit may be provided to facilitate the collection use and interaction with data and information and to achieve the functions of the insurance applications described further below.

The electric vehicle may include one or more input output I O devices and or sensor devices. For example input controllers may be provided with a speaker and a microphone not shown to facilitate voice enabled functionalities such as phone and voice mail functions. In some implementations a loud speaker can be included to facilitate hands free voice functionalities such as speaker phone functions. An audio jack can also be included for use of headphones and or a microphone.

The I O subsystem can include a touch screen controller and or other input controller s . The touch screen controller can be coupled to a touch screen . The touch screen and touch screen controller can for example detect contact and movement or break thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensitivity technologies including but not limited to capacitive resistive infrared and surface acoustic wave technologies as well as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact with the touch screen .

The other input controller s can be coupled to other input control devices such as one or more buttons rocker switches thumb wheel infrared port USB port and or a pointer device such as a stylus. The one or more buttons not shown can include an up down button for volume control of the speaker and or the microphone. In some implementations a proximity sensor can be included to facilitate the detection of the electric vehicle proximate to an electric vehicle charging station.

According to some embodiments the information may instead be displayed via the electric vehicle itself or a charging station meter. Note that information displayed to the driver could also include marketing information entertainment information etc. The processing system may according to some embodiments be associated with an insurance provider. According to some embodiments information associated with the electric vehicle may also be accessible via a web page .

According to some embodiments social network information may be automatically updated when a driver accesses a charging station. For example a message might be posted on a Facebook profile indicating that the driver has saved a certain amount of money or obtained a particular environmental benefit by charging his or her vehicle. As another example a Twitter account might be automatically updated to help other users of a shared community vehicle determine the current location of the vehicle.

According to some embodiments the electric vehicle itself may execute an application and provide information to a drive e.g. via a dashboard display of integrated insurance and charging information . According to other embodiments a mobile device or may store an application program that may be loaded onto the mobile device from an insurance company or from an application repository e.g. such as Apple s App Store or the like . In still other embodiments a terminal or screen at a charging station may execute an insurance related application.

In any of those cases when launched an application may prompt the driver for information used to interact with the insurance company . A variety of different types of data and information may be provided from application to the insurance company including static data regarding the driver such as the driver s user name password policy information etc. The data from mobile device is transmitted via communications network to insurance company for evaluation and processing. A third party provider can also be a source of information associated with drivers and policies.

The insurance company has a computer system that includes application servers load balancing proxy servers data storage unit business logic computer and user interface module to perform electric vehicle insurance functions and or risk evaluation based on the collected data. Employees of the insurance company and other authorized personnel use user interface module to access the insurance company computer system. User interface module may be any type of computing device that is configured to communicate with other computer systems. User interface module may be connected directly to application server or may access an application server via the load balancing proxy servers . User interface module may connect to load balancing proxy servers via a local area network a private data link or via the internet. Although depicted as being part of insurance company in user interface module may be located remotely. The business logic computer is connected to the data storage unit and application servers over a local area network which may be part of communication system . In addition other network infrastructure including for example a firewall backup servers and back up data stores may also be included in the system without departing from the scope of the invention. Communications over the local area network and or over the Internet in one implementation may be encrypted. In addition such communications whether encrypted or not may also be digitally signed for authenticating the source of the communications. The computer system may also include a certificate authority to authenticate one or more of the communications using public key infrastructure.

Based on data collected from the mobile device charging station and or any third party data sources an evaluation module may analyze and evaluate data associated with the electric vehicle . As used herein a module may be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code may for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code could be a single instruction or many instructions and may even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and may exist at least partially merely as electric signals on a system or network. In addition entire modules or portions thereof may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like or as hardwired integrated circuits.

A business logic module implemented preferably in business logic computer is used correlate and track charging information and or perform risk analysis associated with the electric vehicle based on the received data. The business logic module may use predictive models such as neural networks Bayesian networks and support vector machines in performing any underwriting and premium adjustments. In one embodiment the premium of an insurance policy is increased or decreased if data received from the electric warrants. Instead of altering premium rates other terms of the insurance policy can be altered such as the policy deductible. In some embodiments the premiums may be increased or decreased based on charging information associated with the electric vehicle . Further still rates may depend on one or more loss risk scores calculated by the scoring engine described in conjunction with .

In another scenario insurance company awards a drive of the electric vehicle with premium discounts or other advantageous rewards simply for operating certain insurance applications as described herein. Insurance company may award different discounts depending on the nature and amount of data provided by driver and or charging stations.

In one implementation software operating on the application servers act merely as presentation and data extraction and conversion servers. All substantive business logic including underwriting and pricing determinations is carried out on the business logic computer . In this implementation the application servers obtain data from the data storage unit and the business logic computer and incorporate that data into web pages or other graphical user interface formats . These web pages are then communicated by the application servers through the load balancing proxy servers to user interface module for presentation. Upon receiving input from user interface module the application server translates the input into a form suitable for processing by the business logic computer and for storage by the data storage unit . In this implementation the application servers can be operated by third parties who can add their own branding to the web pages or add other customized presentation data. In the alternative at least some of the business logic is also carried out by the application servers . Application servers may also include a webserver for automatically recovering or retrieving data from local computer .

In another implementation the application servers are software modules operating on one or more computers. One of the computers on which the application servers are operating may also serve as the business logic computer and or as a load balancing proxy server .

In other implementations the software operating on user interface module includes a thin or thick client application in addition to or instead of web browser. The thin or thick client application interfaces with a corresponding server application operating on the application server .

The insurance company may perform for example a premium analysis which includes activities that potentially affect a driver s premium deductible amount discounts or credits as well as large scale analysis to provide input into industry or occupation experience factors. The determination of premium and offering of discounts or credits may be performed once at underwriting time regularly on an interval continuously in response to an event or retroactively as permitted by local state and or federal regulations.

The analysis and decisions made by insurance company with regard to premium service adjustments may be transmitted back to driver via the charging station a mobile device and or the electric vehicle itself. Insurance company may save the data and reports received from the charging station and the decisions that were made based upon them in a data storage unit associated with the insurance company or in a separate data warehouse. This archived data may be used for future retrospective analysis claims adjudication and or to support fraud investigation.
