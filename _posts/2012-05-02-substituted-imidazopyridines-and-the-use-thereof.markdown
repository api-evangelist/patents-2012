The present application relates to novel substituted imidazopyridazines to processes for their preparation to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases and to their use for production of medicaments for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases especially for the treatment and or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.

One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP . Together with nitrogen monoxide NO which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals it forms the NO cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate GTP . The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO can bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme free preparations cannot by contrast be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide CO is also able to bind to the central iron atom of heme but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.

By forming cGMP and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases ion channels and protein kinases guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission and also in disorders which are based on a disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions the NO cGMP system can be suppressed which can lead for example to hypertension platelet activation increased cell proliferation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris heart failure myocardial infarction thromboses stroke and sexual dysfunction.

Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects a possible NO independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.

Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates the effect of which is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of heme. In addition to the side effects the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.

In recent years some substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly i.e. without prior release of NO such as for example 3 5 hydroxymethyl 2 furyl 1 benzylindazole YC 1 Wu et al. 84 1994 4226 M lsch et al. 120 1997 681 fatty acids Goldberg et al. 252 1977 1279 diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate Pettibone et al. 116 1985 307 isoliquiritigenin Yu et al. 114 1995 1587 and various substituted pyrazole derivatives WO 98 16223 .

As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase WO 00 06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives and WO 03 095451 carbamate substituted 3 pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines. WO 2008 031513 describes inter alia substituted imidazopyridines and imidazopyrimidines as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase. 4 Amino 5 5 dimethyl 5 7 dihydro 6H pyrrolo 2 3 d pyrimidones having imidazopyridine and pyrimidine substituents are disclosed as sGC activators in WO 2010 065275.

It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as potent stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase.

These auxiliaries include carriers for example microcrystalline cellulose lactose mannitol solvents e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents for example sodium dodecylsulfate polyoxysorbitan oleate binders for example polyvinylpyrrolidone synthetic and natural polymers for example albumin stabilizers e.g. antioxidants for example ascorbic acid dyes e.g. inorganic pigments for example iron oxides and flavor and or odor correctors.

In general it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of from about 0.001 to 1 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg kg of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg kg preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg kg of body weight.

It may nevertheless be necessary in some cases to deviate from the stated amounts specifically as a function of the body weight route of administration individual response to the active ingredient nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus in some cases less than the abovementioned minimum amount may be sufficient while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of relatively large amounts it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.

The test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5 strength Tylose appropriate for an administration volume of 5 ml kg of body weight.

The telemetry measuring unit present is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number Vyear month day .

Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna 1010 Receiver DSI .

The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch and are switched to transmission in the run up to the experiment. The emitted signals can be detected online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for Windows DSI and be appropriately processed. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.

The acquisition of measured values is repeated under computer control at 5 minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute value are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor APR 1 and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the extensive documentation from the manufacturing company DSI .

Unless indicated otherwise the test substances are administered at 9.00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours.

After the end of the experiment the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software Dataquest A.R.T. Analysis . The blank value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration and so the selected data set encompasses the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am the following day.

The data are smoothed over a presettable time by determination of the average 15 minute average and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred into Excel templates and tabulated. For each day of the experiment the data obtained are stored in a dedicated file carrying the number of the experiment. Results and test protocols are filed in paper form sorted by numbers.
