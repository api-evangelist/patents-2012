Cytokines such as interleukin 1 IL 1 and tumor necrosis factor TNF are molecules produced by a variety of cells such as monocytes and macrophages which have been identified as mediators of inflammatory processes. Cytokines including TNF regulate the intensity and duration of the inflammatory response which occurs as the result of an injury or infection. Elevated levels of TNF play an important role in pathologic inflammation. TNF also referred to as TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of human diseases and disorders including sepsis infections autoimmune diseases transplant rejection and graft versus host disease see e.g. Moeller et al. 1990 2 162 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 to Moeller et al. European Patent Publication No. 260 610 B1 by Moeller A. et al. Vasilli 1992 10 411 Tracey and Cerami 1994 45 491 .

TNF has been implicated in psoriasis. Expression of TNF induced proteins and the presence of activated T lymphocytes in psoriatic plaques but not uninvolved skin suggest their involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. There are several types of psoriasis according to cutaneous manifestations plaque psoriasis guttate psoriasis erythrodermic psoriasis generalized pustular and localized pustular psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is the most common type however. Treatment of psoriasis depends on the extent of the disease. Topical corticosteroids are commonly used for mild to moderate localized cases. Keratolytic agents and coal tar are also used as topical medications and phototherapy is commonly used for more widespread disease. Other systemic therapy such as methotrexate cyclosporine and synthetic retinoids are effective but are often administered in rotation due to their possible cumulative toxic effect.

TNF has also been implicated in Crohn s disease. Crohn s is diagnosed on the basis of clinical endoscopic radiographic and histologic criteria. The treatment of Crohn s disease is challenging. Treatment is based on location extent and severity of disease. Current compounds and regimens do not completely abate the inflammatory process and have significant side effects.

The term human TNF abbreviated herein as hTNF or simply hTNF as used herein is intended to refer to a human cytokine that exists as a 17 kD secreted form and a 26 kD membrane associated form the biologically active form of which is composed of a trimer of noncovalently bound 17 kD molecules. The structure of hTNF is described further in for example Pennica D. et al. 1984 312 724 729 Davis J. M. et al. 1987 26 1322 1326 and Jones E. Y. et al. 1989 338 225 228. The term human TNF is intended to include recombinant human TNF rhTNF which can be prepared by standard recombinant expression methods or purchased commercially R D Systems Catalog No. 210 TA Minneapolis Minn. . TNF is also referred to as TNF.

The term TNF inhibitor includes agents which interfere with TNF activity. Examples of TNF inhibitors include etanercept Enbrel Amgen infliximab Remicade Johnson and Johnson human anti TNF monoclonal antibody adalimumab D2E7 HUMIRA Abbott Laboratories CDP 571 Celltech and CDP 870 Celltech as well as other compounds which inhibit TNF activity such that when administered to a subject suffering from or at risk of suffering from a disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental the disorder is treated. The term also includes each of the anti TNF human antibodies and antibody portions described herein as well as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 6 509 015 and in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09 801 185 and 10 302 356 each incorporated by reference herein.

The term antibody as used herein is intended to refer to immunoglobulin molecules comprised of four polypeptide chains two heavy H chains and two light L chains inter connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains CH1 CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability termed complementarity determining regions CDR interspersed with regions that are more conserved termed framework regions FR . Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino terminus to carboxy terminus in the following order FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4. The antibodies of the invention are described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 and 6 509 015 and in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09 801 185 and 10 302 356 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The term antigen binding portion of an antibody or simply antibody portion as used herein refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen e.g. hTNF . It has been shown that the antigen binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term antigen binding portion of an antibody include i a Fab fragment a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL VH CL and CH1 domains ii a F ab fragment a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region iii a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains iv a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody v a dAb fragment Ward et al. 1989 341 544 546 which consists of a VH domain and vi an isolated complementarity determining region CDR . Furthermore although the two domains of the Fv fragment VL and VH are coded for by separate genes they can be joined using recombinant methods by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv scFv see e.g. Bird et al. 1988 242 423 426 and Huston et al. 1988 85 5879 5883 . Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term antigen binding portion of an antibody. Other forms of single chain antibodies such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites see e.g. Holliger P. et al. 1993 90 6444 6448 Poljak R. J. et al. 1994 2 1121 1123 . The antibody portions of the invention are described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 6 509 015 and in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09 801 185 and 10 302 356 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins. Binding fragments include Fab Fab F ab Fabc Fv single chains and single chain antibodies. Other than bispecific or bifunctional immunoglobulins or antibodies an immunoglobulin or antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments.

A conservative amino acid substitution as used herein is one in which one amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art including basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine .

The term human antibody as used herein is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences e.g. mutations introduced by random or site specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However the term human antibody as used herein is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species such as a mouse have been grafted onto human framework sequences.

The term recombinant human antibody as used herein is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared expressed created or isolated by recombinant means such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell described further below antibodies isolated from a recombinant combinatorial human antibody library described further below antibodies isolated from an animal e.g. a mouse that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes see e.g. Taylor L. D. et al. 1992 20 6287 or antibodies prepared expressed created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments however such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis or when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used in vivo somatic mutagenesis and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.

An isolated antibody as used herein is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities e.g. an isolated antibody that specifically binds hTNF is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than hTNF . An isolated antibody that specifically binds hTNF may however have cross reactivity to other antigens such as TNF molecules from other species discussed in further detail below . Moreover an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and or chemicals.

A neutralizing antibody as used herein or an antibody that neutralized hTNF activity is intended to refer to an antibody whose binding to hTNF results in inhibition of the biological activity of hTNF . This inhibition of the biological activity of hTNF can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of hTNF biological activity such as hTNF induced cytotoxicity either in vitro or in vivo hTNF induced cellular activation and hTNF binding to hTNF receptors. These indicators of hTNF biological activity can be assessed by one or more of several standard in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art see U.S. Pat. No. 6 090 382 . Preferably the ability of an antibody to neutralize hTNF activity is assessed by inhibition of hTNF induced cytotoxicity of L929 cells.

Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply expression vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids.

The term treatment phase or maintenance phase as used herein refers to a period of treatment comprising administration of a TNF inhibitor to a subject in order to maintain a desired therapeutic effect. The treatment phase follows the induction phase and therefore is initiated once a threshold level is achieved.

The term treatment dose or maintenance dose is the amount of TNF inhibit or taken by a subject to maintain or continue a desired therapeutic effect. A treatment dose is administered subsequent to the induction dose. A treatment dose can be a single dose or alternatively a set of doses. A treatment dose is administered during the treatment phase of therapy. Treatment doses are smaller than the induction dose and can be equal to each other when administered in succession.

This invention provides a multiple variable dose method of treating a TNF related disorder in which the administration of a TNF inhibitor is beneficial. In one embodiment these methods include administration of isolated human antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof that bind to human TNF with high affinity and a low off rate and have a high neutralizing capacity. Preferably the human antibodies of the invention are recombinant neutralizing human anti hTNF antibodies. The most preferred recombinant neutralizing antibody of the invention is referred to herein as D2E7 also referred to as HUMIRA and adalimumab the amino acid sequence of the D2E7 VL region is shown in SEQ ID NO 1 the amino acid sequence of the D2E7 VH region is shown in SEQ ID NO 2 . The properties of D2E7 HUMIRA have been described in Salfeld et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 and 6 509 015 which are each incorporated by reference herein. Other examples of TNF inhibitors include chimeric and humanized murine anti hTNF antibodies which have undergone clinical testing for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis see e.g. Elliott M. J. et al. 1994 344 1125 1127 Elliot M. J. et al. 1994 344 1105 1110 Rankin E. C. et al. 1995 34 334 342 .

In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention includes the administration of D2E7 antibodies and antibody portions D2E7 related antibodies and antibody portions and other human antibodies and antibody portions with equivalent properties to D2E7 such as high affinity binding to hTNF with low dissociation kinetics and high neutralizing capacity. In one embodiment the invention provides multiple variable dose treatment with an isolated human antibody or an antigen binding portion thereof that dissociates from human TNF with a Kof 1 10M or less and a Krate constant of 1 10sor less both determined by surface plasmon resonance and neutralizes human TNF cytotoxicity in a standard in vitro L929 assay with an ICof 1 10M or less. More preferably the isolated human antibody or antigen binding portion thereof dissociates from human TNF with a Kof 5 10sor less or even more preferably with a Kof 1 10sor less. More preferably the isolated human antibody or antigen binding portion thereof neutralizes human TNF cytotoxicity in a standard in vitro L929 assay with an ICof 1 10M or less even more preferably with an ICof 1 10M or less and still more preferably with an ICof 1 10M or less. In a preferred embodiment the antibody is an isolated human recombinant antibody or an antigen binding portion thereof.

It is well known in the art that antibody heavy and light chain CDR3 domains play an important role in the binding specificity affinity of an antibody for an antigen. Accordingly in another aspect the invention pertains to multiple variable dose methods of treating a TNF related disorder in which the TNF activity is detrimental by administering human antibodies that have slow dissociation kinetics for association with hTNF and that have light and heavy chain CDR3 domains that structurally are identical to or related to those of D2E7. Position 9 of the D2E7 VL CDR3 can be occupied by Ala or Thr without substantially affecting the K. Accordingly a consensus motif for the D2E7 VL CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence Q R Y N R A P Y T A SEQ ID NO 3 . Additionally position 12 of the D2E7 VH CDR3 can be occupied by Tyr or Asn without substantially affecting the K. Accordingly a consensus motif for the D2E7 VH CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence V S Y L S T A S S L D Y N SEQ ID NO 4 . Moreover as demonstrated in Example 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 6 090 382 the CDR3 domain of the D2E7 heavy and light chains is amenable to substitution with a single alanine residue at position 1 4 5 7 or 8 within the VL CDR3 or at position 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 or 11 within the VH CDR3 without substantially affecting the K. Still further the skilled artisan will appreciate that given the amenability of the D2E7 VL and VH CDR3 domains to substitutions by alanine substitution of other amino acids within the CDR3 domains may be possible while still retaining the low off rate constant of the antibody in particular substitutions with conservative amino acids. Preferably no more than one to five conservative amino acid substitutions are made within the D2E7 VL and or VH CDR3 domains. More preferably no more than one to three conservative amino acid substitutions are made within the D2E7 VL and or VH CDR3 domains. Additionally conservative amino acid substitutions should not be made at amino acid positions critical for binding to hTNF . Positions 2 and 5 of the D2E7 VL CDR3 and positions 1 and 7 of the D2E7 VH CDR3 appear to be critical for interaction with hTNF and thus conservative amino acid substitutions preferably are not made at these positions although an alanine substitution at position 5 of the D2E7 VL CDR3 is acceptable as described above see U.S. Pat. No. 6 090 382 .

Accordingly in another embodiment the invention provides multiple variable dose methods of treating a TNF related disorder by the administration of an isolated human antibody or antigen binding portion thereof.

Preferably the LCVR further has a CDR2 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 5 i.e. the D2E7 VL CDR2 and the HCVR further has a CDR2 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 6 i.e. the D2E7 VH CDR2 . Even more preferably the LCVR further has CDR1 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 7 i.e. the D2E7 VL CDR1 and the HCVR has a CDR1 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 8 i.e. the D2E7 VH CDR1 .

No. 6 090 382.

Accordingly in another embodiment the invention provides multiple variable dose methods of treating a TNF related disorder by the administration of an isolated human antibody or antigen binding portion thereof. The antibody or antigen binding portion thereof preferably contains a light chain variable region LCVR comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 i.e. the D2E7 VL and a heavy chain variable region HCVR comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. the D2E7 VH . In certain embodiments the antibody comprises a heavy chain constant region such as an IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA IgE IgM or IgD constant region. Preferably the heavy chain constant region is an IgG1 heavy chain constant region or an IgG4 heavy chain constant region. Furthermore the antibody can comprise a light chain constant region either a kappa light chain constant region or a lambda light chain constant region. Preferably the antibody comprises a kappa light chain constant region. Alternatively the antibody portion can be for example a Fab fragment or a single chain Fv fragment.

In still other embodiments the invention provides multiple variable dose methods of treating a TNF related disorder in which the administration of an anti TNF antibody is beneficial administration of an isolated human antibody or an antigen binding portions thereof. The antibody or antigen binding portion thereof preferably contains D2E7 related VL and VH CDR3 domains for example antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof with a light chain variable region LCVR having a CDR3 domain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 3 SEQ ID NO 11 SEQ ID NO 12 SEQ ID NO 13 SEQ ID NO 14 SEQ ID NO 15 SEQ ID NO 16 SEQ ID NO 17 SEQ ID NO 18 SEQ ID NO 19 SEQ ID NO 20 SEQ ID NO 21 SEQ ID NO 22 SEQ ID NO 23 SEQ ID NO 24 SEQ ID NO 25 and SEQ ID NO 26 or with a heavy chain variable region HCVR having a CDR3 domain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO 4 SEQ ID NO 27 SEQ ID NO 28 SEQ ID NO 29 SEQ ID NO 30 SEQ ID NO 31 SEQ ID NO 32 SEQ ID NO 33 SEQ ID NO 34 and SEQ ID NO 35.

In another embodiment the TNF inhibitor of the invention is etanercept described in WO 91 03553 and WO 09 406 476 infliximab described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 656 272 CDP571 a humanized monoclonal anti TNF alpha IgG4 antibody CDP 870 a humanized monoclonal anti TNF alpha antibody fragment D2E7 a human anti TNF mAb soluble TNF receptor Type I or a pegylated soluble TNF receptor Type I PEGs TNF R1 .

The TNF antibody of the invention can be modified. In some embodiments the TNF antibody or antigen binding fragments thereof is chemically modified to provide a desired effect. For example pegylation of antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention may be carried out by any of the pegylation reactions known in the art as described for example in the following references 3 4 10 1992 EP 0 154 316 and EP 0 401 384 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Preferably the pegylation is carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive polyethylene glycol molecule or an analogous reactive water soluble polymer . A preferred water soluble polymer for pegylation of the antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention is polyethylene glycol PEG . As used herein polyethylene glycol is meant to encompass any of the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize other proteins such as mono Cl ClO alkoxy or aryloxy polyethylene glycol.

Methods for preparing pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention will generally comprise the steps of a reacting the antibody or antibody fragment with polyethylene glycol such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG under conditions whereby the antibody or antibody fragment becomes attached to one or more PEG groups and b obtaining the reaction products. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art to select the optimal reaction conditions or the acylation reactions based on known parameters and the desired result.

Pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments may generally be used to treat TNF related disorders of the invention by administration of the TNF antibodies and antibody fragments described herein. Generally the pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments have increased half life as compared to the nonpegylated antibodies and antibody fragments. The pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments may be employed alone together or in combination with other pharmaceutical compositions.

In yet another embodiment of the invention TNF antibodies or fragments thereof can be altered wherein the constant region of the antibody is modified to reduce at least one constant region mediated biological effector function relative to an unmodified antibody. To modify an antibody of the invention such that it exhibits reduced binding to the Fc receptor the immunoglobulin constant region segment of the antibody can be mutated at particular regions necessary for Fc receptor FcR interactions see e.g. Canfield S. M. and S. L. Morrison 1991 173 1483 1491 and Lund J. et al. 1991 147 2657 2662 . Reduction in FcR binding ability of the antibody may also reduce other effector functions which rely on FcR interactions such as opsonization and phagocytosis and antigen dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

An antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be derivatized or linked to another functional molecule e.g. another peptide or protein . Accordingly the antibodies and antibody portions of the invention are intended to include derivatized and otherwise modified forms of the human anti hTNF antibodies described herein including immunoadhesion molecules. For example an antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be functionally linked by chemical coupling genetic fusion noncovalent association or otherwise to one or more other molecular entities such as another antibody e.g. a bispecific antibody or a diabody a detectable agent a cytotoxic agent a pharmaceutical agent and or a protein or peptide that can mediate associate of the antibody or antibody portion with another molecule such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag .

One type of derivatized antibody is produced by crosslinking two or more antibodies of the same type or of different types e.g. to create bispecific antibodies . Suitable crosslinkers include those that are heterobifunctional having two distinctly reactive groups separated by an appropriate spacer e.g. m maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester or homobifunctional e.g. disuccinimidyl suberate . Such linkers are available from Pierce Chemical Company Rockford Ill.

Useful detectable agents with which an antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be derivatized include fluorescent compounds. Exemplary fluorescent detectable agents include fluorescein fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine 5 dimethylamine 1 napthalenesulfonyl chloride phycoerythrin and the like. An antibody may also be derivatized with detectable enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase horseradish peroxidase glucose oxidase and the like. When an antibody is derivatized with a detectable enzyme it is detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a detectable reaction product. For example when the detectable agent horseradish peroxidase is present the addition of hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product which is detectable. An antibody may also be derivatized with biotin and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding.

An antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be prepared by recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes in a host cell. To express an antibody recombinantly a host cell is transfected with one or more recombinant expression vectors carrying DNA fragments encoding the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains of the antibody such that the light and heavy chains are expressed in the host cell and preferably secreted into the medium in which the host cells are cultured from which medium the antibodies can be recovered. Standard recombinant DNA methodologies are used to obtain antibody heavy and light chain genes incorporate these genes into recombinant expression vectors and introduce the vectors into host cells such as those described in Sambrook Fritsch and Maniatis eds Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 Ausubel F. M. et al. eds. Greene Publishing Associates 1989 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 397 by Boss et al.

To express D2E7 or a D2E7 related antibody DNA fragments encoding the light and heavy chain variable regions are first obtained. These DNAs can be obtained by amplification and modification of germline light and heavy chain variable sequences using the polymerase chain reaction PCR . Germline DNA sequences for human heavy and light chain variable region genes are known in the art see e.g. the Vbase human germline sequence database see also Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 Tomlinson I. M. et al. 1992 The Repertoire of Human Germline VSequences Reveals about Fifty Groups of VSegments with Different Hypervariable Loops 227 776 798 and Cox J. P. L. et al. 1994 A Directory of Human Germ line VSegments Reveals a Strong Bias in their Usage 24 827 836 the contents of each of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference . To obtain a DNA fragment encoding the heavy chain variable region of D2E7 or a D2E7 related antibody a member of the V3 family of human germline VH genes is amplified by standard PCR. Most preferably the DP 31 VH germline sequence is amplified. To obtain a DNA fragment encoding the light chain variable region of D2E7 or a D2E7 related antibody a member of the VI family of human germline VL genes is amplified by standard PCR. Most preferably the A20 VL germline sequence is amplified. PCR primers suitable for use in amplifying the DP 31 germline VH and A20 germline VL sequences can be designed based on the nucleotide sequences disclosed in the references cited supra using standard methods.

Once the germline VH and VL fragments are obtained these sequences can be mutated to encode the D2E7 or D2E7 related amino acid sequences disclosed herein. The amino acid sequences encoded by the germline VH and VL DNA sequences are first compared to the D2E7 or D2E7 related VH and VL amino acid sequences to identify amino acid residues in the D2E7 or D2E7 related sequence that differ from germline. Then the appropriate nucleotides of the germline DNA sequences are mutated such that the mutated germline sequence encodes the D2E7 or D2E7 related amino acid sequence using the genetic code to determine which nucleotide changes should be made. Mutagenesis of the germline sequences is carried out by standard methods such as PCR mediated mutagenesis in which the mutated nucleotides are incorporated into the PCR primers such that the PCR product contains the mutations or site directed mutagenesis.

Once DNA fragments encoding D2E7 or D2E7 related VH and VL segments are obtained by amplification and mutagenesis of germline VH and VL genes as described above these DNA fragments can be further manipulated by standard recombinant DNA techniques for example to convert the variable region genes to full length antibody chain genes to Fab fragment genes or to a scFv gene. In these manipulations a VL or VH encoding DNA fragment is operatively linked to another DNA fragment encoding another protein such as an antibody constant region or a flexible linker. The term operatively linked as used in this context is intended to mean that the two DNA fragments are joined such that the amino acid sequences encoded by the two DNA fragments remain in frame.

The isolated DNA encoding the VH region can be converted to a full length heavy chain gene by operatively linking the VH encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding heavy chain constant regions CH1 CH2 and CH3 . The sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art see e.g. Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The heavy chain constant region can be an IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA IgE IgM or IgD constant region but most preferably is an IgG1 or IgG4 constant region. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene the VH encoding DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule encoding only the heavy chain CH1 constant region.

The isolated DNA encoding the VL region can be converted to a full length light chain gene as well as a Fab light chain gene by operatively linking the VL encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region CL. The sequences of human light chain constant region genes are known in the art see e.g. Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant region but most preferably is a kappa constant region.

To create a scFv gene the VH and VL encoding DNA fragments are operatively linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker e.g. encoding the amino acid sequence Gly Ser such that the VH and VL sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single chain protein with the VL and VH regions joined by the flexible linker see e.g. Bird et al. 1988 242 423 426 Huston et al. 1988 85 5879 5883 McCafferty et al. 1990 348 552 554 .

To express the antibodies or antibody portions of the invention DNAs encoding partial or full length light and heavy chains obtained as described above are inserted into expression vectors such that the genes are operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control sequences. In this context the term operatively linked is intended to mean that an antibody gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vector or more typically both genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector by standard methods e.g. ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment and vector or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present . Prior to insertion of the D2E7 or D2E7 related light or heavy chain sequences the expression vector may already carry antibody constant region sequences. For example one approach to converting the D2E7 or D2E7 related VH and VL sequences to full length antibody genes is to insert them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions respectively such that the VH segment is operatively linked to the CH segment s within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively the recombinant expression vector can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide i.e. a signal peptide from a non immunoglobulin protein .

In addition to the antibody chain genes the recombinant expression vectors of the invention carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain genes in a host cell. The term regulatory sequence is intended to include promoters enhancers and other expression control elements e.g. polyadenylation signals that control the transcription or translation of the antibody chain genes. Such regulatory sequences are described for example in Goeddel 185 Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1990 . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector including the selection of regulatory sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed the level of expression of protein desired etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells such as promoters and or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus CMV such as the CMV promoter enhancer Simian Virus 40 SV40 such as the SV40 promoter enhancer adenovirus e.g. the adenovirus major late promoter AdMLP and polyoma. For further description of viral regulatory elements and sequences thereof see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 168 062 by Stinski U.S. Pat. No. 4 510 245 by Bell et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4 968 615 by Schaffner et al.

In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences the recombinant expression vectors of the invention may carry additional sequences such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells e.g. origins of replication and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 399 216 4 634 665 and 5 179 017 all by Axel et al. . For example typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs such as G418 hygromycin or methotrexate on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene for use in dhfr host cells with methotrexate selection amplification and the neo gene for G418 selection .

For expression of the light and heavy chains the expression vector s encoding the heavy and light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term transfection are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell e.g. electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation DEAE dextran transfection and the like. Although it is theoretically possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells and most preferably mammalian host cells is the most preferred because such eukaryotic cells and in particular mammalian cells are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody. Prokaryotic expression of antibody genes has been reported to be ineffective for production of high yields of active antibody Boss M. A. and Wood C. R. 1985 6 12 13 .

Preferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells including dhfr CHO cells described in Urlaub and Chasin 1980 77 4216 4220 used with a DHFR selectable marker e.g. as described in R. J. Kaufman and P. A. Sharp 1982 159 601 621 NS0 myeloma cells COS cells and SP2 cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or more preferably secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.

Host cells can also be used to produce portions of intact antibodies such as Fab fragments or scFv molecules. It is understood that variations on the above procedure are within the scope of the present invention. For example it may be desirable to transfect a host cell with DNA encoding either the light chain or the heavy chain but not both of an antibody of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to remove some or all of the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for binding to hTNF . The molecules expressed from such truncated DNA molecules are also encompassed by the antibodies of the invention. In addition bifunctional antibodies may be produced in which one heavy and one light chain are an antibody of the invention and the other heavy and light chain are specific for an antigen other than hTNF by crosslinking an antibody of the invention to a second antibody by standard chemical crosslinking methods.

In a preferred system for recombinant expression of an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof of the invention a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr CHO cells by calcium phosphate mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to CMV enhancer AdMLP promoter regulatory elements to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection amplification. The selected transformant host cells are culture to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector transfect the host cells select for transformants culture the host cells and recover the antibody from the culture medium.

Recombinant human antibodies of the invention in addition to D2E7 or an antigen binding portion thereof or D2E7 related antibodies disclosed herein can be isolated by screening of a recombinant combinatorial antibody library preferably a scFv phage display library prepared using human VL and VH cDNAs prepared from mRNA derived from human lymphocytes. Methodologies for preparing and screening such libraries are known in the art. In addition to commercially available kits for generating phage display libraries e.g. the Pharmacia catalog no. 27 9400 01 and the Stratagene SurfZAP phage display kit catalog no. 240612 examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display libraries can be found in for example Ladner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 223 409 Kang et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 18619 Dower et al. PCT Publication No. WO 91 17271 Winter et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 20791 Markland et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 15679 Breitling et al. PCT Publication No. WO 93 01288 McCafferty et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 01047 Garrard et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 09690 Fuchs et al. 1991 9 1370 1372 Hay et al. 1992 3 81 85 Huse et al. 1989 246 1275 1281 McCafferty et al. 1990 348 552 554 Griffiths et al. 1993 12 725 734 Hawkins et al. 1992 226 889 896 Clackson et al. 1991 352 624 628 Gram et al. 1992 89 3576 3580 Garrard et al. 1991 9 1373 1377 Hoogenboom et al. 1991 19 4133 4137 and Barbas et al. 1991 88 7978 7982.

In a preferred embodiment to isolate human antibodies with high affinity and a low off rate constant for hTNF a murine anti hTNF antibody having high affinity and a low off rate constant for hTNF e.g. MAK 195 the hybridoma for which has deposit number ECACC 87 050801 is first used to select human heavy and light chain sequences having similar binding activity toward hTNF using the epitope imprinting methods described in Hoogenboom et al. PCT Publication No. WO 93 06213. The antibody libraries used in this method are preferably scFv libraries prepared and screened as described in McCafferty et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 01047 McCafferty et al. 1990 348 552 554 and Griffiths et al. 1993 12 725 734. The scFv antibody libraries preferably are screened using recombinant human TNF as the antigen.

Once initial human VL and VH segments are selected mix and match experiments in which different pairs of the initially selected VL and VH segments are screened for hTNF binding are performed to select preferred VL VH pair combinations. Additionally to further improve the affinity and or lower the off rate constant for hTNF binding the VL and VH segments of the preferred VL VH pair s can be randomly mutated preferably within the CDR3 region of VH and or VL in a process analogous to the in vivo somatic mutation process responsible for affinity maturation of antibodies during a natural immune response. This in vitro affinity maturation can be accomplished by amplifying VH and VL regions using PCR primers complimentary to the VH CDR3 or VL CDR3 respectively which primers have been spiked with a random mixture of the four nucleotide bases at certain positions such that the resultant PCR products encode VH and VL segments into which random mutations have been introduced into the VH and or VL CDR3 regions. These randomly mutated VH and VL segments can be rescreened for binding to hTNF and sequences that exhibit high affinity and a low off rate for hTNF binding can be selected.

Following screening and isolation of an anti hTNF antibody of the invention from a recombinant immunoglobulin display library nucleic acid encoding the selected antibody can be recovered from the display package e.g. from the phage genome and subcloned into other expression vectors by standard recombinant DNA techniques. If desired the nucleic acid can be further manipulated to create other antibody forms of the invention e.g. linked to nucleic acid encoding additional immunoglobulin domains such as additional constant regions . To express a recombinant human antibody isolated by screening of a combinatorial library the DNA encoding the antibody is cloned into a recombinant expression vector and introduced into a mammalian host cells as described in further detail in above.

Methods of isolating human antibodies with high affinity and a low off rate constant for hTNF are also described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 and 6 509 015 each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

The invention provides a multiple variable dose method for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from a disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental. TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders see e.g. Moeller A. et al. 1990 2 162 169 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 to Moeller et al. European Patent Publication No. 260 610 B1 by Moeller A. . TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of a TNF related disorders including sepsis infections autoimmune diseases transplant rejection and graft versus host disease see e.g. Moeller A. et al. 1990 2 162 169 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 to Moeller et al. European Patent Publication No. 260 610 B1 by Moeller A. et al. Vasilli P. 1992 10 411 452 Tracey K. J. and Cerami A. 1994 45 491 503 . The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from a TNF related disorder which method comprises administering to a subject an initial induction dose and subsequently administering a treatment dose of an antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor such that TNF activity is inhibited. Preferably the TNF is human TNF and the subject is a human subject. In one embodiment the TNF inhibitor is D2E7 also referred to as HUMIRA adalimumab .

As used herein the term a disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is intended to include diseases and other disorders in which the presence of TNF in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Accordingly a disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is a disorder in which inhibition of TNF activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and or progression of the disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced for example by an increase in the concentration of TNF in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder e.g. an increase in the concentration of TNF in serum plasma synovial fluid etc. of the subject which can be detected for example using an anti TNF antibody as described above. There are numerous examples of disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental. The use of TNF inhibitors including antibodies and antibody portions of the invention in the treatment of specific disorders using a multiple variable dose therapy is discussed further below 

Tumor necrosis factor has an established role in the pathophysiology of sepsis with biological effects that include hypotension myocardial suppression vascular leakage syndrome organ necrosis stimulation of the release of toxic secondary mediators and activation of the clotting cascade see e.g. Moeller A. et al. 1990 2 162 169 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 to Moeller et al. European Patent Publication No. 260 610 B1 by Moeller A. Tracey K. J. and Cerami A. 1994 45 491 503 Russell D. and Thompson R. C. 1993 4 714 721 . The multiple variable dose methods of the invention can be used to treat sepsis in any of its clinical settings including septic shock endotoxic shock gram negative sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.

Furthermore to treat sepsis an anti hTNF antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic agents that may further alleviate sepsis such as an interleukin 1 inhibitor such as those described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 92 16221 and WO 92 17583 the cytokine interleukin 6 see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 93 11793 or an antagonist of platelet activating factor see e.g. European Patent Application Publication No. EP 374 510 . Other combination therapies including multiple variable dose therapies for the treatment of sepsis are discussed further in subsection IV. In a preferred embodiment an anti TNF antibody or antibody portion is administered to a human subject within a subgroup of sepsis patients having a serum or plasma concentration of IL 6 above 500 pg ml and more preferably 1000 pg ml at the time of treatment see PCT Publication No. WO 95 20978 by Daum L. et al. .

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in playing a role in the pathophysiology of a variety of autoimmune diseases. For example TNF has been implicated in activating tissue inflammation and causing joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis see e.g. Moeller A. et al. 1990 2 162 169 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 to Moeller et al. European Patent Publication No. 260 610 B1 by Moeller A. Tracey and Cerami supra Arend W. P. and Dayer J M. 1995 38 151 160 Fava R. A. et al. 1993 94 261 266 . TNF also has been implicated in promoting the death of islet cells and in mediating insulin resistance in diabetes see e.g. Tracey and Cerami supra PCT Publication No. WO 94 08609 . TNF also has been implicated in mediating cytotoxicity to oligodendrocytes and induction of inflammatory plaques in multiple sclerosis see e.g. Tracey and Cerami supra . TNF also has been implicated in mediating cytotoxicity to oligodendrocytes and induction of inflammatory plaques in multiple sclerosis see e.g. Tracey and Cerami supra . Chimeric and humanized murine anti hTNF antibodies have undergone clinical testing for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis see e.g. Elliott M. J. et al. 1994 344 1125 1127 Elliot M. J. et al. 1994 344 1105 1110 Rankin E. C. et al. 1995 34 334 342 .

TNF inhibitors including human antibodies and antibody portions such as D2E7 may be used in a multiple variable dose method to treat autoimmune diseases in particular those associated with inflammation. Examples of such autoimmune conditions include rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid spondylitis osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis allergy multiple sclerosis autoimmune diabetes autoimmune uveitis and nephrotic syndrome. Other examples of autoimmune conditions include multisystem autoimmune diseases and autoimmune hearing loss.

Typically the antibody or antibody portion is administered systemically although for certain disorders local administration of the antibody or antibody portion at a site of inflammation may be beneficial e.g. local administration in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis or topical application to diabetic ulcers alone or in combination with a cyclohexane ylidene derivative as described in PCT Publication No. WO 93 19751 . TNF inhibitors including human antibodies and antibody portions such as D2E7 also can be administered with one or more additional therapeutic agents useful in the multiple variable dose treatment of autoimmune diseases as discussed further in subsection IV.

In one embodiment of the invention a human TNF antibody is used in multiple variable dose therapy to treat autoimmune disorders such as lupus. Lupus is has been shown to be associated with TNF activity Shvidel et al. 2002 3 32 Studnicka Benke et al. 1996 35 1067 . The term lupus as used herein refers to a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder called lupus erythematosus that may affect many organ systems including the skin joints and internal organs. Lupus is a general term which includes a number of specific types of lupus including systemic lupus lupus nephritis and lupus cerebritis. In systemic lupus SLE the body s natural defenses are turned against the body and rogue immune cells attack the body s tissues. Antibodies may be produced that can react against the body s blood cells organs and tissues. This reaction leads to immune cells attacking the affected systems producing a chronic disease. Lupus nephritis also referred to as lupus glomerular disease is kidney disorder that is usually a complication of SLE and is characterized by damage to the glomerulus and progressive loss of kidney function. Lupus cerebritis refers to another complication of SLE which is inflammation of the brain and or central nervous system.

Another autoimmune disease which can be treated using the multiple variable dose treatment of the invention is Crohn s disease which is described in more detail below in the Intestinal Disorders Section.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in mediating biological effects observed in a variety of infectious diseases. For example TNF has been implicated in mediating brain inflammation and capillary thrombosis and infarction in malaria. TNF also has been implicated in mediating brain inflammation inducing breakdown of the blood brain barrier triggering septic shock syndrome and activating venous infarction in meningitis. TNF also has been implicated in inducing cachexia stimulating viral proliferation and mediating central nervous system injury in acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS . Accordingly antibodies and antibody portions directed against TNF can be used in multiple variable dose treatment of infectious diseases including bacterial meningitis see e.g. European Patent Application Publication No. EP 585 705 cerebral malaria AIDS and AIDS related complex ARC see e.g. European Patent Application Publication No. EP 230 574 as well as cytomegalovirus infection secondary to transplantation see e.g. Fietze et al. 1994 58 675 . The antibodies and antibody portions of the invention also can be used to alleviate symptoms associated with infectious diseases including fever and myalgias due to infection such as influenza and cachexia secondary to infection e.g. secondary to AIDS or ARC .

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated as a key mediator of allograft rejection and graft versus host disease GVHD and in mediating an adverse reaction that has been observed when the rat antibody OKT3 directed against the T cell receptor CD3 complex is used to inhibit rejection of renal transplants see e.g. Eason et al. 1995 59 300 Suthanthiran and Strom 1994 331 365 . Accordingly the antibodies and antibody portions of the invention can be used to inhibit transplant rejection using multiple variable dose treatment including rejections of allografts and xenografts and to inhibit GVHD. Although the antibody or antibody portion may be used alone more preferably it is used in combination with one or more other agents that inhibit the immune response against the allograft or inhibit GVHD. For example in one embodiment an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is used in combination with OKT3 to inhibit OKT3 induced reactions. In another embodiment an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is used in combination with one or more antibodies directed at other targets involved in regulating immune responses such as the cell surface molecules CD25 interleukin 2 receptor CD11a LFA 1 CD54 ICAM 1 CD4 CD45 CD28 CTLA4 CD80 B7 1 and or CD86 B7 2 . In yet another embodiment an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is used in combination with one or more general immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporin A or FK506.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in inducing cachexia stimulating tumor growth enhancing metastatic potential and mediating cytotoxicity in malignancies. Accordingly antibodies and antibody portions which directed against TNF can be used in the multiple variable dose treatment of malignancies wherein treatment inhibits tumor growth or metastasis and or alleviates cachexia secondary to malignancy. The antibody or antibody portion may be administered systemically or locally to the tumor site.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome ARDS including stimulating leukocyte endothelial activation directing cytotoxicity to pneumocytes and inducing vascular leakage syndrome. The multiple variable dose methods of the invention can be used to treat various pulmonary disorders including adult respiratory distress syndrome using multiple variable dose treatment see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 91 04054 shock lung chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease pulmonary sarcoidosis pulmonary fibrosis and silicosis. The antibody or antibody portion may be administered systemically or locally to the lung surface for example as an aerosol. An antibody or antibody portion also can be administered with one or more additional therapeutic agents useful in the multiple variable dose treatment of pulmonary disorders as discussed further in subsection IV.

Other examples of pulmonary disorders in which TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology include idiopathic interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive airway disorders see e.g. Piquet et al. 1989 170 655 Whyte et al. 2000 162 755 Anticevich et al. 1995 284 221 . The invention further provides methods for treating TNF activity in a subject suffering from such a pulmonary disorder which method comprises administering to the subject an antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor using a multiple variable dose regimen such that TNF activity in the subject suffering from idiopathic interstitial lung disease or a chronic obstructive airway disorder is inhibited. Examples of idiopathic interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive airway disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental are discussed further below.

In one embodiment the TNF antibody of the invention is used in multiple variable dose treatment regimen to treat subjects who have an idiopathic interstitial lung disease. The term idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF refers to a group of disorders characterized by inflammation and eventually scarring of the deep lung tissues leading to shortness of breath. The scarring of the alveoli air sacs and their supporting structures the interstitium in IPF eventually leads to a loss of the functional alveolar units and a reduction of the transfer of oxygen from air to blood. IPF is also referred to as diffuse parenchymal lung disease alveolitis cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis CFA idiopathic pulmonary pneumonitis IPP and usual interstitial pneumonitis UIP . IPF is often used synonymously with UIP IPF UIP because UIP is the most common cellular pattern seen in the pathologic diagnosis of IPF.

Idiopathic interstitial lung diseases affect the lungs in three ways first the lung tissue is damaged in some known or unknown way second the walls of the air sacs in the lung become inflamed and finally scarring or fibrosis begins in the interstitium or tissue between the air sacs and the lung becomes stiff. Examples of idiopathic interstitial lung diseases include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF . Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF see Piquet et al. 1989 170 655 Whyte et al. 2000 162 755 Corbett et al. 2002 165 690 . For example it has been found that IPF patients have increased levels of TNF expression in macrophages and in type II epithelial cells Piquet et al. 1993 143 651 Nash et al. 1993 22 343 Zhang et al. 1993 150 4188 . Certain genetic polymorphisms are also associated with increased TNF expression and are implicated in playing a role in IPF and silicosis Whyte et al. supra Corbett et al. supra .

Patients with IPF often exhibit certain symptoms including a dry cough chest pain and or shortness of breath. Commonly used drugs for the treatment of IPF are prednisone and cytoxan although only a fraction of patients improve with continued use of these drugs American Thoracic Society 2000 161 646 . Oxygen administration and transplantation of the lung are other choices for treatment. In one embodiment antibodies used in the multiple variable dose methods of the invention may be used in combination with another therapeutic agent for example oxygen for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Examples of animal models used to study idiopathic interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive airway disorders include ovalbumin OVA induced allergic asthma mice and cigarette smoke induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mice see Hessel et al. 1995 293 401 Keast et al. 1981 135 249 .

In one embodiment a TNF antibody is used in multiple variable dose treatment regimen to treat a subject who has a chronic obstructive airflow disorder. In these diseases airflow obstruction may be chronic and persistent or episodic and recurrent. Airflow obstruction is usually determined by forced expiratory spirometry which is the recording of exhaled volume against time during a maximal expiration. In a subject who does not have an obstructed airflow a full forced expiration usually takes between 3 and 4 seconds. In a patient with chronic obstructive airflow disorder wherein airflow is obstructed it usually takes up to 15 to 20 seconds and may be limited by breath holding time. The normal forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration FEV is easily measured and accurately predicted on the basis of age sex and height. The ratio of FEVto forced vital capacity FEV FVC normally exceeds 0.75. Recording airflow against volume during forced expiration and a subsequent forced inspiration the flow volume loop is also useful mainly for distinguishing upper from lower airway narrowing. Examples of chronic obstructive airway disorders are described below.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma Anticevich et al. 1995 284 221 Thomas et al. 1995152 76 Thomas and Heywood 2002 57 774 . For example acute asthma attacks have been found to be associated with pulmonary neutrophilia and elevated BAL TNF levels Ordonez et al. 2000 161 1185 . It has been found that the severity of asthma symptoms correlates with endotoxin levels in house dust. In rats anti TNF antibodies reduced endotoxin induced airway changes Kips et al. 1992 145 332 .

The term asthma as used herein refers to a disorder in which inflammation of the airways causes airflow into and out of the lungs to be restricted. Asthma is also referred to as bronchial asthma exercise induced asthma bronchial and reactive airways disease RAD . In some instances asthma is associated with allergies and or is familial. Asthma includes a condition which is characterized by widespread fluctuations in the diameter or caliber of bronchial airways over short periods of time resulting in changes in lung function. The resulting increased resistance to air flow produces symptoms in the affected subject including breathlessness dyspnea chest constriction or tightness and wheezing.

Patients with asthma are characterized according to NIH guidelines are described as mild intermittent mild persistent moderate persistent and severe persistent see NAEPP Expert Panel Report Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma Update on Selected Topics 2002. JACI 2002 110 S141 S209 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. NIH Publication 97 4051 July 1997 . Patients diagnosed with moderate persistent asthma are often treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Patients diagnosed with severe persistent asthma are often treated with high dose inhaled corticosteroids and p.o. corticosteroids.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Keatings 2000 118 971 Sakao et al. 2001 163 420 Sakao et al. 2002 122 416 . The term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD as used interchangeably herein refers to a group of lung diseases characterized by limited airflow with variable degrees of air sack enlargement and lung tissue destruction. The term COPD includes chronic bronchitis mucous hypersecretion with goblet cell submucosal gland hyperplasia chronic obstructive bronchitis or emphysema destruction of airway parenchyma or combinations of these conditions. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the most common forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. COPD is defined by irreversible airflow obstruction.

In COPD chronic inflammation leads to fixed narrowing of small airways and lung parenchyma and alveolar wall destruction emphysema . This is characterized by increased numbers of alveolar macrophages neutrophils and cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the release of multiple inflammatory mediators lipids chemokines cytokines growth factors . This inflammation leads to fibrosis with a narrowing of the small airways and lung parenchymal destruction. There is also a high level of oxidative stress which may amplify this inflammation.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disorders including Crohn s disease see e.g. Tracy et al. 1986 234 470 Sun et al. 1988 81 1328 MacDonald et al. 1990 81 301 . Chimeric murine anti hTNF antibodies have undergone clinical testing for treatment of Crohn s disease van Dullemen et al. 1995 109 129 . The invention includes a multiple variable dose regimen comprising administering a TNF inhibitor to treat intestinal disorders such as idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease using human antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof. Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease includes two syndromes Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose regimen of the invention is also used to treat disorders often associated with IBD and Crohn s disease. The term inflammatory bowel disorder IBD related disorder or Crohn s disease related disorder as used interchangeably herein is used to describe conditions and complications commonly associated with IBD and Crohn s disease.

The invention includes a multiple variable dose regimen comprising administering a TNF inhibitor to treat Crohn s disease. The treatment of Crohn s disease is based on location extent and severity of disease. Pharmacologic interventions include anti inflammatory agents aminosalicylates and corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents azathioprine and 6 mercaptopurine 6 MP cyclosporine methotrexate MTX antibiotic agents and biologic agents . C reactive protein CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR levels reflect non specific acute phase reactions. Endoscopy is a primary means of diagnosing Crohn s disease. Radiologic features of Crohn s disease are shown by barium examination includes mucosal edema aphthous and linear ulcerations asymmetrical narrowing and strictures and separation of adjacent loops of bowel caused by mesenteric thickening. Abnormalities are focal and asymmetric. The primary histologic lesion is anaphthous ulcer. Subjects with Crohn s disease can be evaluated using the Crohn s Disease Activity Index CDAI which is a standard measure of the severity of the disease with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity.

Examples of Crohn s disease related disorders which can be treated using the methods of the invention include fistulas in the bladder vagina and skin bowel obstructions abscesses nutritional deficiencies complications from corticosteroid use inflammation of the joints erythem nodosum pyoderma gangrenosum and lesions of the eye. Other disorders commonly associated with Crohn s disease include Crohn s related arthralgias fistulizing Crohn s indeterminant colitis and pouchitis.

The multiple variable dose methods of the invention also can be used to treat in of various cardiac or coronary disorders including ischemia of the heart see e.g. European Patent Application Publication No. EP 453 898 and heart insufficiency weakness of the heart muscle see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 94 20139 . TNF has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of restenosis see e.g. Clausell et al. 1994 supra Medall et al. 1997 78 273 .

As used herein the term a cardiac disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is intended to include coronary and cardiovascular diseases in which the presence of TNF in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder including cardiovascular disorders e.g. restenosis. The term cardiovascular disorder or coronary disorder as used interchangeably herein refers to any disease disorder or state involving the cardiovascular system e.g. the heart the blood vessels and or the blood. A coronary disorder is generally characterized by a narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart coronary arteries . Coronary disease may result from the build up of fatty material and plaque. As the coronary arteries narrow the flow of blood to the heart can slow or stop. Coronary disorders of the invention can apply to any abnormality of an artery whether structural histological biochemical or any other abnormality. An example of coronary heart disease is restenosis. In one embodiment a coronary disorder refers to any disease disorder or state involving the cardiovascular system excluding ischemia of the heart and heart insufficiency.

Coronary disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental often result from a blockage in an artery. Such a blockage can be caused by a clot which usually forms in a coronary artery that has been previously narrowed from changes usually related to atherosclerosis. For example if the atherosclerotic plaque inside the arterial wall cracks it can trigger the formation of a thrombus or clot. Such disorders may be evidenced for example by an increase in the concentration of TNF in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder e.g. an increase in the concentration of TNF in serum plasma synovial fluid etc. of the subject which can be detected for example using an anti TNF antibody as described above. A coronary disorder can be also caused by an imbalance in arterial pressure a malfunction of the heart or an occlusion of a blood vessel e.g. by a thrombus. Coronary disorders includes both coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease.

There are numerous examples of cardiac disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental including restenosis. The use of the antibodies antibody portions and other TNF inhibitors in multiple variable dose regimens for treatment of specific coronary disorders is discussed further below. In certain embodiments a antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor is administered to the subject in combination with another therapeutic agent as described below.

The invention provides a multiple variable dose method for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject with a cardiac disorder. The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting or decreasing TNF activity in a subject with a coronary disorder comprising administering to the subject an antibody or antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor of the invention such that TNF activity in the subject is inhibited or decreased. Preferably the TNF is human TNF and the subject is a human subject. Alternatively the subject can be a mammal expressing a TNF with which an antibody of the invention cross reacts. Still further the subject can be a mammal into which has been introduced hTNF e.g. by administration of hTNF or by expression of an hTNF transgene . An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes.

Moreover an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non human mammal expressing a TNF with which the antibody cross reacts e.g. a primate pig or mouse for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter such animal models may be useful for evaluating the multiple variable dose therapeutic efficacy e.g. testing of dosages and time courses of administration . Commonly used animal models for studying coronary disorders including restenosis include the rat or mouse carotid artery ligation model and the carotid artery injury model Ferns et al. 1991 253 1129 Clowes et al. 1983 Lab. Invest. 49 208 Lindner et al. 1993 73 792 . In the carotid artery ligation model arterial blood flow is disrupted by ligation of the vessel near the distal bifurnation. As described in Clowes et al. the carotid artery injury model is performed such that the common carotid artery is denuded of endothelium by the intraluminal passage of a balloon catheter introduced through the external carotid artery. At 2 weeks the carotid artery is markedly narrowed due to smooth muscle cell constriction but between 2 and 12 weeks the intimal doubles in thickness leading to a decrease in luminal size. Any of these models can be used to determine the potential therapeutic action of the TNF antibodies of the invention in the prevention and treatment of restenosis in humans.

The invention includes multiple variable dose regimen for treatment of cardiovascular disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental wherein inhibition of TNF activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and or progression of the coronary disease or to prevent the coronary disease. Subjects suffering from or at risk of developing coronary disorders can be identified through clinical symptoms. Clinical symptoms in coronary disease often include chest pain shortness of breath weakness fainting spells alterations in consciousness extremity pain paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea transient ischemic attacks and other such phenomena experienced by the patient. Clinical signs of coronary disease can also include EKG abnormalities altered peripheral pulses arterial bruits abnormal heart sounds rates and wheezes jugular venous distention neurological alterations and other such findings discerned by the clinician. Coronary disorders may also be evidenced for example by an increase in the concentration of TNF in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder e.g. an increase in the concentration of TNF in serum plasma synovial fluid etc. of the subject .

Examples of a cardiovascular disorder include but are not limited to coronary artery disease angina pectoris myocardial infarction cardiovascular tissue damage caused by cardiac arrest cardiovascular tissue damage caused by cardiac bypass cardiogenic shock and hypertension atherosclerosis coronary artery spasm coronary artery disease valvular disease arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. The use of the antibodies antibody portions and other TNF inhibitors in multiple variable dose regimens for treatment of specific cardiovascular diseases are discussed further below. In certain embodiments the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor is administered to the subject in combination with another therapeutic agent as described below in section IV.

The term restenosis as used herein refers to the recurrence of stenosis which is the narrowing or constriction of an artery. Restenosis often occurs as a preocclusive lesion that develops following a reconstructive procedure in a diseased blood vessel. The term is not only applied to the recurrence of a pre existing stenosis but also to previously normal vessels that become partially occluded following vascular bypass. In another embodiment the invention provides a method of treating restenosis comprising administering the antibody or antigen binding portion thereof of the invention to a subject who has or is at risk of developing restenosis.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of restenosis see Zhou et al. 2002 Atherosclerosis. 161 153 Javed et al. 2002 73 104 . For example in the murine wire carotid model TNF mice demonstrated a seven fold reduction in initial hyperplasia compared to wild type mice Zimmerman et al. 2002 283 R505 . Restenosis can occur as the result of any type of vascular reconstruction whether in the coronary vasculature or in the periphery Colburn and Moore 1998 Myointimal Hyperplasia pp. 690 709 in Philadelphia Saunders . For example studies have reported symptomatic restenosis rates of 30 50 following coronary angioplasties see Berk and Harris 1995 40 455 . After carotid endarterectomies as a further example 20 of patients studied had a luminal narrowing greater than 50 Clagett et al. 1986 J. Vasc. Surg. 3 10 . Restenosis is evidenced in different degrees of symptomatology which accompany preocclusive lesions in different anatomical locations due to a combination of factors including the nature of the vessels involved the extent of residual disease and local hemodynamics.

 Stenosis as used herein refers to a narrowing of an artery as seen in occlusive disorder or in restenosis. Stenosis can be accompanied by those symptoms reflecting a decrease in blood flow past the narrowed arterial segment in which case the disorder giving rise to the stenosis is termed a disease i.e. occlusive disease or restenosis disease . Stenosis can exist asymptomatically in a vessel to be detected only by a diagnostic intervention such as an angiography or a vascular lab study.

The multiple variable dose method of the invention can be used to treat a subject suffering from or at risk of developing restenosis. A subject at risk of developing restenosis includes a subject who has undergone PTCA. The subject may have also had a stent inserted to prevent restenosis. The TNF antibody can be used alone or in combination with a stent to prevent the re occurrence of stenosis in a subject suffering from cardiovascular disease.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure see Zhou et al. 2002 161 153 . Serum levels of TNF are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure in a manner which is directly proportional to the severity of the disease Levine et al. 1990 323 236 Torre Amione et al. 1996 27 1201 . In addition inhibitors of TNF have also been shown to improve congestive heart failure symptoms Chung et al. 2003 Circulation 107 3133 .

As used herein the term congestive heart failure includes a condition characterized by a diminished capacity of the heart to supply the oxygen demands of the body. Symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure include diminished blood flow to the various tissues of the body accumulation of excess blood in the various organs e.g. when the heart is unable to pump out the blood returned to it by the great veins exertional dyspnea fatigue and or peripheral edema e.g. peripheral edema resulting from left ventricular dysfunction. Congestive heart failure may be acute or chronic. The manifestation of congestive heart failure usually occurs secondary to a variety of cardiac or systemic disorders that share a temporal or permanent loss of cardiac function. Examples of such disorders include hypertension coronary artery disease valvular disease and cardiomyopathies e.g. hypertrophic dilative or restrictive cardiomyopathies.

A subject who has or is suffering from congestive heart failure is a subject who has a disorder involving a clinical syndrome of diverse etiologies linked by the common denominator of impaired heart pumping in which the heart cannot pump blood commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues or can do so only from an elevated filling pressure. A subject at risk of developing congestive heart failure is a subject who has a propensity of developing congestive heart failure because of certain factors affecting the cardiovascular system of the subject. It is desirable to reduce the risk of or prevent the development of congestive heart failure in these subjects. The phrase with congestive heart failure includes patients who are at risk of suffering from this condition relative to the general population even though they may not have suffered from it yet by virtue of exhibiting risk factors. For example a patient with untreated hypertension may not have suffered from congestive heart failure but is at risk because of his or her hypertensive condition. In one embodiment of the invention the antibody D2E7 is used to treat a subject at risk of developing congestive heart failure using multiple variable dose treatment.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes see Libby 1995 91 2844 . Acute coronary syndromes include those disorders wherein the subject experiences pain due to a blood flow restriction resulting in not enough oxygen reaching the heart. Studies have found that TNF plays a role in acute coronary syndromes. For example in a novel rat heterotropic cardiac transplantation coronary ligation model capable of inducing myocardial infarction in the absence of downstream hemodynamic effects administration of chimeric soluble TNF receptor sTNFR abolished transient LV remodeling and dysfunction Nakamura et al. 2003 41 41 . It was also found that direct injection of an sTNFR expression plasmid to the myocardium resulted in a reduction in the infarction size in acute myocardial infarction AMI experimental rats Sugano et al. 2002 16 1421 .

In one embodiment a TNF antibody is used in a multiple variable dose method for the treatment or prevention of an acute coronary syndrome in a subject wherein the acute coronary syndrome is a myocardial infarction or angina.

As used herein the term myocardial infarction or MI refers to a heart attack. A myocardial infarction involves the necorsis or permanent damage of a region of the heart due to an inadequate supply of oxygen to that area. This necrosis is typically caused by an obstruction in a coronary artery from either atherosclerosis or an embolis. MIs which are treated by the TNF antibody of the invention include both Q wave and non Q wave myocardial infarction. Most heart attacks are caused by a clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries the blood vessels that bring blood and oxygen to the heart muscle . For example a clot in the coronary artery interrupts the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle leading to the death of heart cells in that area. The damaged heart muscle permanently loses its ability to contract and the remaining heart muscle needs to compensate for it. An MI can also be caused by overwhelming stress in the individual.

The term angina refers to spasmodic choking or suffocative pain and especially as denoting angina pectoris which is a paroxysmal thoracic pain due most often to anoxia of the myocardium. Angina includes both variant angina and exertional angina. A subject having angina has ischemic heart disease which is manifested by sudden severe pressing substemal pain that often radiates to the left shoulder and along the left arm. TNF has been implicated in angina as TNF levels are upregulated in patients with both MI and stable angina Balbay et al. 2001 52109 .

 Atherosclerosis as used herein refers to a condition in which fatty material is deposited along the walls of arteries. This fatty material thickens hardens and may eventually block the arteries. Atherosclerosis is also referred to arteriosclerosis hardening of the arteries and arterial plaque buildup. Polyclonal antibodies directed against TNF have been shown to be effective at neutralizing TNF activity resulting in inflammation and restenosis in the rabbit atherosclerotic model Zhou et al. supra . Accordingly a TNF antibody can be used to treat or prevent subjects afflicted with or at risk of having atherosclerosis using the multiple variable dose method of the invention.

The term cardiomyopathy as used herein is used to define diseases of the myocardium wherein the heart muscle or myocardium is weakened usually resulting in inadequate heart pumping. Cardiomyopathy can be caused by viral infections heart attacks alcoholism long term severe hypertension high blood pressure or by autoimmune causes.

In approximately 75 80 of heart failure patients coronary artery disease is the underlying cause of the cardiomyopathy and is designated ischemic cardiomyopathy. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is caused by heart attacks which leave scars in the heart muscle or myocardium. The affected myocardium is then unable to contribute to the heart pumping function. The larger the scars or the more numerous the heart attacks the higher the chance there is of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Cardiomyopathies that are not attributed to underlying coronary artery disease and are designated non ischemic cardiomyopathies. Non ischemic cardiomyopathies include but are not limited to idiopathic cardiomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy alcoholic cardiomyopathy dilated cardiomyopathy peripartum cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders including inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthopathies see e.g. Moeller et al. 1990 2 162 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 European Patent Publication No. 260 610 . The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from a spondyloarthropathy which method comprises administering to the subject an antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor initially in an induction dose followed by a treatment dose such that TNF activity in the subject suffering from a spondyloarthropathy is inhibited.

As used herein the term spondyloarthropathy or spondyloarthropathies is used to refer to any one of several diseases affecting the joints of the spine wherein such diseases share common clinical radiological and histological features. A number of spondyloarthropathies share genetic characteristics i.e. they are associated with the HLA B27 allele. In one embodiment the term spondyloarthropathy is used to refer to any one of several diseases affecting the joints of the spine excluding ankylosing spondylitis wherein such diseases share common clinical radiological and histological features. Examples of spondyloarthropathies include ankylosing spondylitis psoriatic arthritis spondylitis enteropathic arthritis reactive arthritis or Reiter s syndrome and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies. Examples of animal models used to study spondyloarthropathies include ank ank transgenic mice HLA B27 transgenic rats see Taurog et al. 1998 . Oxford Oxford University Press .

The multiple variable dose methods of the invention can also be used to treat subjects who are at risk of developing a spondyloarthropathy using multiple variable dose methods. Examples of subjects who are at risk of having spondyloarthropathies include humans suffering from arthritis. Spondyloarthropathies can be associated with other forms of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis. In one embodiment of the invention antibodies are used in multiple variable dose methods to treat a subject who suffers from a spondyloarthropathy associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Examples of spondyloarthropathies which can be treated with a TNF antibody using the multiple variable dose method of the invention are described below 

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis see Verjans et al. 1991 34 486 Verjans et al. 1994 97 45 Kaijtzel et al. 1999 60 140 . Ankylosing spondylitis AS is an inflammatory disorder involving inflammation of one or more vertebrae. AS is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the axial skeleton and or peripheral joints including joints between the vertebrae of the spine and sacroiliac joints and the joints between the spine and the pelvis. AS can eventually cause the affected vertebrae to fuse or grow together. Spondyarthropathies including AS can be associated with psoriatic arthritis PsA and or inflammatory bowel disease IBD including ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease.

Early manifestations of AS can be determined by radiographic tests including CT scans and MRI scans. Early manifestations of AS often include scroiliitis and changes in the sacroliac joints as evidenced by the blurring of the cortical margins of the subchrondral bone followed by erosions and sclerosis. Fatigue has also been noted as a common symptom of AS Duffy et al. 2002 66Abstract . Accordingly multiple variable dose methods comprising administering an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the invention can be used to treat AS.

In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat a spondyloarthropathy associated with IBD including AS. AS is often treated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications NSAIDs such as aspirin or indomethacin. Accordingly a TNF antibody used in the multiple variable dose method of the invention may also be administered in combination with agents commonly used to reduce inflammation and pain commonly associated with ankylosing spondylitis.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psoriatic arthritis PsA Partsch et al. 1998 57 691 Ritchlin et al. 1998 25 1544 . As referred to herein psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis associated with the skin refers to chronic inflammatory arthritis which is associated with psoriasis which is a common chronic skin condition that causes red patches on the body. About 1 in 20 individuals with psoriasis will develop arthritis along with the skin condition and in about 75 of cases psoriasis precedes the arthritis. PsA exhibits itself in a variety of ways ranging from mild to severe arthritis wherein the arthritis usually affects the fingers and the spine. When the spine is affected the symptoms are similar to those of ankylosing spondylitis as described above. The TNF antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the invention can be used in multiple variable dose treatment of PsA.

PsA is sometimes associated with arthritis mutilans. Arthritis mutilans refers to a disorder which is characterized by excessive bone erosion resulting in a gross erosive deformity which mutilates the joint. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention can be used to treat arthritis mutilans.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of reactive arthritis which is also referred to as Reiter s syndrome Braun et al. 1999 42 10 2039 . Reactive arthritis ReA refers to arthritis which complicates an infection elsewhere in the body often following enteric or urogenital infections. ReA is often characterized by certain clinical symptoms including inflammation of the joints arthritis urethritis conjunctivitis and lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. In addition ReA can occurs following infection with a sexually transmitted disease or dysenteric infection including chlamydia or . Accordingly the multiple variable dose method of the invention can be used to treat ReA using the multiple variable dose method of the invention.

In one embodiment multiple variable dose methods of the invention of the invention are used to treat subjects suffering from undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies see Zeidler et al. 1992 18 187 . Other terms used to describe undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies include seronegative oligoarthritis and undifferentiated oligoarthritis. Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies as used herein refers to a disorder wherein the subject demonstrates only some of the symptoms associated with a spondyloarthropathy. This condition is usually observed in young adults who do not have IBD psoriasis or the classic symptoms of AS or Reiter s syndrome. In some instances undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies may be an early indication of AS. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention comprises administering different doses of a TNF antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to treat undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders including metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity Spiegelman and Hotamisligil 1993 73 625 Chu et al. 2000 24 1085 Ishii et al. 2000 49 1616 . The term metabolic disorder as used herein refers to diseases or disorders which affect how the body processes substances needed to carry out physiological functions. Examples of metabolic disorders include but are not limited to diabetes and obesity. In one embodiment of the invention the term metabolic disorder is used to refer to disorders which affect how the body processes substances needed to carry out physiological functions excluding autoimmune diabetes.

The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from such a metabolic disorder which method comprises administering to the subject an induction dose followed by a treatment dose of an antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor such that TNF activity in the subject suffering from a metabolic disorder is inhibited. TNF antibodies can also be used to treat subjects who are at risk of developing a metabolic disorder using the multiple variable dose regimen of the invention.

Metabolic disorders are often associated with arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis. In one embodiment a TNF inhibitor such as an antibody is used in a multiple variable dose regimen in a subject who suffers from a metabolic disorder associated with rheumatoid arthritis. In another embodiment the multiple variable dose treatment of the invention comprises administering a TNF antibody to treat disorders associated with diabetes or obesity.

Examples of animal models for evaluating the efficacy of a multiple variable dose regimen using a TNF antibody for the treatment of a metabolic disorder include NOD transgenic mice Akita mice NSY transgenic mice and ob ob mice see Baeder et al. 1992 89 174 Haseyama et al. 2002 198 233 Makino et al. 1980 29 1 Kolb 1987 3 751 Hamada et al. 2001 50 1282 Coleman 1978 14 141 Bailey et al. 1982 6 11 . Examples of animal models used to study vasculitis includes the mouse HSV model Behcet s disease the mouse model Kawasaki s disease and the mouse ANCA model Kawasaki s disease . Other models of vasculitis include the MCH5 lpr lpr strain Nose et al. 1996 149 1763 and the SCG Kj strain of mice Kinjoh et al. 1993 90 3413 . These mice strains spontaneously develop crescentic glomerulonephritis and necrotizing vasculitis of the small arteries and arterioles of the spleen stomach heart uterus and ovaries. These animals develop hypergammaglobulinemia and ANCA autoantibodies that react with myeloperoxidase MPO . Additionally immunization of rats with human MPO results in ANCA associated necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis Brouwer et al. 1993 177 905 .

Metabolic disorders affect how the body processes substances needed to carry out physiological functions. A number of metabolic disorders of the invention share certain characteristics i.e. they are associated the insulin resistance lack of ability to regulate blood sugar weight gain and increase in body mass index. Examples of metabolic disorders include diabetes and obesity. Examples of diabetes include type 1 diabetes mellitus type 2 diabetes mellitus diabetic neuropathy peripheral neuropathy diabetic retinopathy diabetic ulcerations retinopathy ulcerations diabetic macrovasculopathy and obesity. Examples of metabolic disorders which can be treated using multiple variable dose methods comprising administration of a TNF antibody are described in more detail below 

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes. see e.g. Navarro et al. 2003 42 53 Daimon et al. 2003 26 2015 Zhang et al. 1999 19 203 Barbieri et al. 2003 16 537 For example TNF is implicated in the pathophysiology for insulin resistance. It has been found that serum TNF levels in patients with gastrointestinal cancer correlates with insulin resistance see e.g. McCall et al. 1992 79 1361 .

The term diabetes or diabetic disorder or diabetes mellitus as used interchangeably herein refers to a disease which is marked by elevated levels of sugar glucose in the blood. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin a chemical produced by the pancreas to regulate blood sugar resistance to insulin or both. Diabetes includes the two most common types of the disorder namely type I diabetes and type II diabetes which both result from the body s inability to regulate insulin. Insulin is a hormone released by the pancreas in response to increased levels of blood sugar glucose in the blood.

The term type 1 diabetes as used herein refers to a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas produces too little insulin to regulate blood sugar levels appropriately. Type 1 diabetes is also referred to as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus IDMM juvenile onset diabetes and diabetes type I. Type 1 diabetes represents is the result of a progressive autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic cells with subsequent insulin deficiency.

The term type 2 diabetes refers to a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not make enough insulin to keep blood glucose levels normal often because the body does not respond well to the insulin. Type 2 diabetes is also referred to as noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus NDDM and diabetes type II

Diabetes is can be diagnosed by the administration of a glucose tolerance test. Clinically diabetes is often divided into several basic categories. Primary examples of these categories include autoimmune diabetes mellitus non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus type 1 NDDM insulin dependant diabetes mellitus type 2 IDDM non autoimmune diabetes mellitus non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus type 2 NIDDM and maturity onset diabetes of the young MODY . A further category often referred to as secondary refers to diabetes brought about by some identifiable condition which causes or allows a diabetic syndrome to develop. Examples of secondary categories include diabetes caused by pancreatic disease hormonal abnormalities drug or chemical induced diabetes diabetes caused by insulin receptor abnormalities diabetes associated with genetic syndromes and diabetes of other causes. see e.g. Harrison s 1996 14ed. New York McGraw Hill .

Diabetes is often treated with diet insulin dosages and various medications described herein. Accordingly a TNF antibody may also be administered in combination with agents commonly used to treat metabolic disorders and pain commonly associated with diabetes in the multiple variable dose method of the invention.

In addition the phrase disorders associated with diabetes as used herein refers to conditions and other diseases which are commonly associated with or related to diabetes. Example of disorders associated with diabetes include for example hyperglycemia hyperinsulinaemia hyperlipidaemia insulin resistance impaired glucose metabolism obesity diabetic retinopathy macular degeneration cataracts diabetic nephropathy glomerulosclerosis diabetic neuropathy erectile dysfunction premenstrual syndrome vascular restenosis ulcerative colitis coronary heart disease hypertension angina pectoris myocardial infarction stroke skin and connective tissue disorders foot ulcerations metabolic acidosis arthritis and osteoporosis. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose methods of the invention can be used to treat disorders associated with diabetes.

Diabetes manifests itself in the foregoing categories and can cause several complications that are discussed in the following sections. Accordingly the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the invention can be used to treat diabetes. In one embodiment a TNF antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is used to treat diabetes associated with the above identified catagories using the multiple variable dose method of the invention. In another embodiment the invention includes multiple variable dose regimens comprising administering a TNF antibody to treat disorders associated with diabetes. Diabetes manifests itself in many complications and conditions associated with diabetes including the following catagories 

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy. See Benj afield et al. 2001 24 753 Qiang et al. 1998 41 1321 Pfeiffer et al. 1997 29 111 .

The term neuropathy also referred to as nerve damage diabetic as used herein refers to a common complication of diabetes in which nerves are damaged as a result of hyperglycemia high blood sugar levels . A variety of diabetic neuropathies are recognized such as distal sensorimotror polyneuropathy focal motor neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy.

The term peripheral neuropathy also known as peripheral neuritis and diabetic neuropathy as used herein refers to the failure of the nerves to carry information to and from the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral neuropathy produces symptoms such as pain loss of sensation and the inability to control muscles. In some cases the failure of nerves to control blood vessels intestinal function and other organs results in abnormal blood pressure digestion and loss of other basic involuntary processes. Peripheral neuropathy may involve damage to a single nerve or nerve group mononeuropathy or may affect multiple nerves polyneuropathy .

Neuropathies that affect small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are known as peripheral neuropathies. Furthermore the related disorder of peripheral neuropathy also known as peripheral neuritis and diabetic neuropathy refers to the failure of the nerves to carry information to and from the brain and spinal cord. This produces symptoms such as pain loss of sensation and the inability to control muscles. In some cases failure of nerves controlling blood vessels intestinal function and other organs results in abnormal blood pressure digestion and loss of other basic involuntary processes. Peripheral neuropathy may involve damage to a single nerve or nerve group mononeuropathy or may affect multiple nerves polyneuropathy .

The term diabetic neuropathy refers to a common complication of diabetes in which nerves are damaged as a result of hyperglycemia high blood sugar levels . Diabetic neuropathy is also referred to as neuropathy and nerve damage diabetic. A variety of diabetic neuropathies are recognized such as distal sensorimotror polyneuropathy focal motor neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopthy Scholz et al. 2003 11 171 . The term diabetic retinopathy as used herein refers to progressive damage to the eye s retina caused by long term diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy includes proliferative retinopathy. Proliferative neuropathy in turn includes neovascularization pertinal hemmorrhave and retinal detachement.

In advanced retinopathy small vessels proliferate on the surface of the retina. These blood vessels are fragile tend to bleed and can cause pertinal hemorrhages. The hemorrhage can obscure vision and as the hemorrhage is resorbed fibrous tissue forms predisposing to retinal detachments and loss of vision. In addition diabetic retinopathy includes prolferative retinopathy which includes neovascularization pertinal hemmorrhave and retinal detachement. Daibetic retinopathy also includes background retinopathy which involves changes occurring with the layers of the retina.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetic ulcerations see Lee et al. 2003 64 614 Navarro et al. 2003 42 53 Daimon et al 2003 26 2015 Zhang et al. 1999 19 203 Barbieri et al. 2003 16 537 Venn et al. 1993 36 819 Westacott et al. 1994 21 1710 .

The term diabetic ulcerations as used herein refers to an ulcer which results as a complication of diabetes. An ulcer is a crater like lesion on the skin or mucous membrane caused by an inflammatory infectious malignant condition or metabolic disorder. Typically diabetic ulcers can be found on limbs and extremeties more typically the feet. These ulcers caused by diabetic conditions such as neuropathy and a vacualr insuffciency can lead to ischemia and poor wound healing. More extensive ulcerations may progress to ostemyelitis. Once ostemyelitis develops it may be difficult to eradicate with antibotics alone and amputation maybe necessary.

The term retinopathy ulcerations as used herein refers to an ulcer which causes or results in damages to the eye and the eye s retina. Retinopathy ulcerations may include conditions such has retinoathic hemmorages.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetic macrovasculopathy Devaraj et al. 2000 102 191 Hattori et al. 2000 46 188 Clausell et al. 1999 8 145 . The term diabetic macrovasculopathy also referred to as macrovascular disease as used herein refers to a disease of the blood vessels that results from diabetes. Diabetic macrovasculopathy complication occurs when for example fat and blood clots build up in the large blood vessels and stick to the vessel walls. Diabetic macrovasculopathies include diseases such as coronary disease cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease and strokes.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity see e.g. Pihlajamaki J et al. 2003 11 912 Barbieri et al. 2003 16 537 Tsuda et al. 2003 133 2125 . The term obesity as used herein refers to a condition in which the subject has an excess of body fat relative to lean body mass. In one embodiment obesity refers to a condition in which an individual weighs at least about 20 or more over the maximum desirable for their height. When an adult is more than 100 pounds overweight he or she is considered to be morbidly obese. In another embodiment obesity is defined as a BMI body mass index over 30 kg m2. Obesity increases a person s risk of illness and death due to diabetes stroke coronary artery disease hypertension high cholesterol and kidney and gallbladder disorders. Obesity may also increase the risk for some types of cancer and may be a risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis and sleep apnea. Obesity can be treated using the multiple variable dose methods of the invention.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of anemias see e.g. Jongen Lavrencic et al. 1997 24 1504 Demeter et al. 2002 81 566 DiCato 2003 8 suppl 1 19 . The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from anemia which method comprises administering to the subject an induction dose followed by a treatment dose of a TNF inhibitor wherein the TNF inhibitor is an antibody antibody portion such that TNF activity in the subject suffering from anemia is inhibited. In one embodiment the anemia is associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

The term anemia as used herein refers to an abnormally low number of circulating red cells or a decreased concentration of hemoglobin in the blood. Examples of anemia related to rheumatoid arthritis include for example anemia of chronic disease iron deficiency anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In one embodiment the invention provides a method of treating anemias related to for example anemias related to rheumatoid arthritis anemias of infection and chronic inflammatory diseases iron deficiency anemia autoimmune hemolytic anemia myelophthisic anemia aplastic anemia hypoplastic anemia pure red cell aplasia and anemia associated with renal failure or endocrine disorders megaloblastic anemias defects in heme or globin synthesis anemia caused by a structural defect in red blood cells e.g. sickle cell anemia and anemias of unknown origins such as sideroblastic anemia anemia associated with chronic infections such as malaria trypanosomiasis HIV hepatitis virus or other viruses and myelophthisic anemias caused by marrow deficiencies.

Examples of animal models used to study anemia include rats inoculated with peptidolglycan polysaccharide polymers see Coccia et al. 2001 29 1201 1209 . Examples of animal models used to study pain are well known in the art and include the rat sciatic nerve ligation model and the rat segmental spinal nerve ligation model see Bennett and Zie 1988 33 87 107 Kim and Chung 1992 50 355 363 .

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of pain syndromes see e.g. Sorkin et al. 1997 81 255 Huygen et al. 2002 11 47 Parada et al. 2003 17 1847 . The term pain as used herein refers to all types of pain. The term shall refer to acute and chronic pains such as neuropathic pain and post operative pain chronic lower back pain cluster headaches herpes neuralgia phantom limb pain central pain dental pain opioid resistant pain visceral pain surgical pain bone injury pain pain during labor and delivery pain resulting from burns including sunburn post partum pain migraine angina pain and genitourinary tract related pain including cystitis. The term also includes nociceptive pain or nociception.

The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from such a pain disorder which method comprises administering to the subject an induction dose followed by a treatment dose of an antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor such that TNF activity in the subject suffering from pain is inhibited. Pain has been defined in a variety of ways including nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. The most commonly experienced form of pain may be defined as the effect of a stimulus on nerve endings which results in the transmission of impulses to the cerebrum. Pain is also commonly associated with inflammatory disorders including for example rheumatoid arthritis. In one embodiment the antibody of the invention is used to treat a subject who suffers from pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Examples of pain disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental are discussed further below.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain see Sommer 1999 13 315 Empl et al. 2001 56 1371 Schafers et al. 2003 23 3028 . As used herein the term neuropathic pain refers to pain that results from injury to a nerve spinal cord or brain and often involves neural supersensitivity. Examples of neuropathic pain include chronic lower back pain pain associated with arthritis cancer associated pain herpes neuralgia phantom limb pain central pain opioid resistant neuropathic pain bone injury pain and pain during labor and delivery. Other examples of neuropathic pain include post operative pain cluster headaches dental pain surgical pain pain resulting from severe for example third degree burns post partum pain angina pain genitourinary tract related pain and including cystitis.

Neuropathic pain is distinguished from nociceptive pain. Pain involving a nociceptive mechanism usually is limited in duration to the period of tissue repair and generally is alleviated by available analgesic agents or opioids Myers 1995 20 173 . Neuropathic pain typically is long lasting or chronic and often develops days or months following an initial acute tissue injury. Neuropathic pain can involve persistent spontaneous pain as well as allodynia which is a painful response to a stimulus that normally is not painful. Neuropathic pain also can be characterized by hyperalgesia in which there is an accentuated response to a painful stimulus that usually is trivial such as a pin prick. Unlike nociceptive pain neuropathic pain generally is resistant to opioid therapy Myers supra 1995 . Accordingly the multiple variable dose methods of the invention can be used to treat neuropathic pain.

As used herein the term nociceptive pain refers to pain that is transmitted across intact neuronal pathways i.e. pain caused by injury to the body. Nociceptive pain includes somatic sensation and normal function of pain and informs the subject of impending tissue damage. The nociceptive pathway exists for protection of the subject e.g. the pain experienced in response to a burn . Nociceptive pain includes bone pain visceral pain and pain associated with soft tissue.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of visceral pain see Coelho et al. 2000 279 G781 Coelho et al. 2000 52 223 . Visceral pain is used to refer to nociceptive pain that is mediated by receptors on A delta and C nerve fibers. A delta and C nerve fibers are which are located in skin bone connective tissue muscle and viscera. Visceral pain can be vague in distribution spasmodic in nature and is usually described as deep aching squeezing and colicky in nature. Examples of visceral pain include pain associated with a heart attack wherein the visceral pain can be felt in the arm neck and or back and liver capsule pain wherein the visceral pain can be felt in the back and or right shoulder. Accordingly the multiple variable dose methods of the invention can be used to treat visceral pain.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of hepatic disorders see e.g. Colletti et al. 1990 85 1936 Tiegs 1997 60 176 Fernandez et al. 2000 6 321 . The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from such a hepatic disorder.

As used herein the term a hepatic disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is intended to include diseases and other disorders of the liver or conditions associated with hepatocellular injury or a biliary tract disorders in which the presence of TNF in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Accordingly a hepatic disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is a disorder in which inhibition of TNF activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and or progression of the hepatic disorder. In one embodiment hepatic disorders refers to a human liver disease or condition associated with hepatocellular injury or a biliary tract disorder excluding hepatitis alcoholic hepatitis and viral hepatitis.

Examples of animal models used for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of an agent for treating a hepatic disorder using multiple variable dose methods include the chimpanzee hepatitis C virus model see Shimizu et al. 1990 87 6441 . Examples of animal models used to study skin and nail disorder disorders include for example the severe combined immunodeficient SCID mouse model psoriasis and the Smith line SL chicken and depigmenting mouse vitiligo see Nickoloff 2000 5 67 Austin et al. 1995 146 1529 Lerner et al. 1986 87 299 .

Hepatic disorders include many diseases and disorders wherein the liver functions improperly or ceases to function. Hepatocellular injuries can include alcoholic cirrhosis 1 antitypsin deficiency autoimmune cirrhosis cryptogenic cirrhosis fulminant hepatitis hepatitis B and C and steatohepatitis. Examples of biliary tract disorders include cystic fibrosis primary biliary cirrhosis sclerosing cholangitis and biliary obstruction Wiesner 1996 Current Indications Contra Indications and Timing for Liver Transplantation in Saunders publ. Busuttil and Klintmalm eds. Chapter 6 Klein 1998 Partial Hypertension The Role of Liver Transplantation Musby publ. in 6.sup.th Ed. Cameron J. ed .

The term hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis can be caused by infections with various organisms including bacteria viruses Hepatitis A B C etc. or parasites. Chemical toxins such as alcohol drugs or poisonous mushrooms can also damage the liver and cause it to become inflamed. A rare but extremely dangerous cause of hepatitis results from overdose of acetaminophen Tylenol which can be deadly. In addition immune cells in the body may attack the liver and cause autoimmune hepatitis. Hepatitis may resolve quickly acute hepatitis or cause long term disease chronic hepatitis . In some instances progressive liver damage or liver failure may result. The incidence and severity of hepatitis vary depending on many factors including the cause of the liver damage and any underlying illnesses in a patient.

In one embodiment the invention features multiple variable methods for treating a hepatic disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of a TNF inhibitor in an induction dose and subsequently in a treatment dose such that said disorder is treated. In one embodiment the hepatic disorder is selected from the group consisting of hepatitis C virus autoimmune hepatitis fatty liver disease hepatitis B virus hepatotoxicity and non alcoholic hepatitis including non alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH . Examples of hepatic disorders are further described below.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the hepatitis C virus see Gonzalez Amaro. 1994 179 841 Nelson et al. 1997 42 2487 Kallinowski et al. 1998 111 269 . The term hepatitis C virus or HCV is used to describe the hepatitis virus which is the causative agent of non A non B hepatitis. Hepatitis C virus causes an inflammation of the liver. HCV infection causes hepatitis C. Hepatitis C in the acute stage is in general milder than hepatitis B but a greater proportion of such infections become chronic. HCV is a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV is one of the viruses A B C D and E which together account for the vast majority of cases of viral hepatitis. It is an enveloped RNA virus in the flaviviridae family which appears to have a narrow host range. An important feature of the virus is the relative mutability of its genome which in turn is probably related to the high propensity 80 of inducing chronic infection. HCV is clustered into several distinct genotypes which may be important in determining the severity of the disease and the response to treatment. In one embodiment the invention provides a multiple variable dose method for treating HCV.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autoimmune hepatitis see Cookson et al. 1999 30 851 Jazrawi et al. 2003 9 377 . As used herein autoimmune hepatitis refers to a hepatic disorder characterized by inflammation of the liver caused by rogue immune cells that mistake the liver s normal cells for a foreign tissue or pathogen disease causing agent . Autoimmune hepatitis is often responsible for a progressive destruction of the hepatic parenchyma with a high mortality if left untreated Johnson et al. 1993 18 998 . One of the characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis is the presence of circulating autoantibodies in almost 90 of patients sera. Such antibodies can be used to identify subjects who have autoimmune hepatitis.

Clinical and serological differences between patients have lead to the classification of AIH into two types. Type 1 is characterized by the presence of anti smooth muscle SMA and or anti nuclear antibodies ANA in patients sera while sera from Type II patients show anti liver kidney microsomal antibodies type 1 LKM1 Homberg et al. 1987 7 1333 Maggiore et al. 1993 17 376 . A serological marker anti liver cytosol type I antibodies LC1 has been identified in 30 of patients with an AIH type II. In addition LC1 proved to be the only serological marker in 10 of patients tested Martini et al. 1988 8 1662 . In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat AIH.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of fatty liver disease see Valenti et al. 2002 Gastroenerology 122 274 Li et al. 2003 37 343 . Fatty liver disease refers to a disease wherein fat hepatocytes is excessively accumulated in the liver. Fatty liver disease is believed to be caused by supernutrition hyperingestion of alcohol diabetes and side effects due to administration of pharmaceuticals. Fatty liver disease can cause severe diseases such as chronic hepatitis and hepatic cirrhosis. In patients with fatty liver disease lipids particularly neutral fat accumulate in hepatocytes to the extent that the amount exceeds the physiologically permissible range. From a biochemical point of view a standard for judgment of fatty liver is that the weight of neutral fat is about 10 100 mg g wet weight or more of the wet weight of hepatic tissue. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat fatty liver disease.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatitis B virus see Kasahara et al. 2003 77 2469 Wang 2003 9 641 Biermer et al. 2003 77 4033 . The term hepatitis B virus HBV is used to describe the virus serum hepatitis virus which produces viral hepatitis type B in humans. This is a viral disease with a long incubation period about 50 to 160 days in contrast to hepatitis A virus infectious hepatitis virus which has a short incubation period. The hepatitis B virus is usually transmitted by injection of infected blood or blood derivatives or merely by use of contaminated needles lancets or other instruments. Clinically and pathologically the disease is similar to viral hepatitis type A however there is no cross protective immunity. Viral antigen HBAg is found in the serum after infection.

Hepatitis B virus infects humans at a very high rate. Most people who become infected with Hepatitis B get rid of the virus within 6 months wherein a short infection is known as an acute case of Hepatitis B. It is estimated that at least about 300 million people are chronic carriers of HBV. Infection with the virus results in a range of clinical symptoms including minor flu like symptoms to death. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat HBV infection.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatotoxicity see Bruccoleri et al. 1997 25 133 Luster et al. 2000 919 214 Simeonova et al. 2001 177 112 . The term hepatotoxicity refers to liver damage caused by medications and other chemicals or drugs. The best indicator for identifying liver toxicity in a subject is the elevation of certain enzyme measurements in the blood such as AST aspartate aminotransferase ALT alanine aminotransferase and GOT glutamate oxalacetate transaminase .

Hepatotoxicity can cause permanent injury and death. Initial symptoms of hepatotoxicity can include acute gastrointestinal symptoms e.g. severe diarrhea. The second phase of hepatotoxicity is characterized by abatement of symptoms. During this apparent subsidence biochemical evidence of hepatic injury appears. Oliguria decreased urine output is usual during the second phase. The third phase that of overt hepatic damage becomes clinically apparent 3 to 5 days after ingestion of the chemical with the appearance of jaundice. Renal failure may also occur. The symptoms of chemically induced drug induced hepatitis are similar to that of infectious hepatitis. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat hepatotoxicity.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of liver failure e.g. chronic liver failure see Takenaka et al. 1998 43 887 Nagaki et al. 1999 31 997 Streetz et al. 2000 119 446. Liver failure including chronic liver failure usually develops over a period of years and is caused by a repeated insult to the liver such as alcohol abuse or infection with hepatitis virus which slowly damages the organ. Less commonly liver failure is acute and occurs over a period of days or weeks. Causes of acute liver failure include hepatitis virus infections drugs pregnancy autoimmune disease and sudden low blood flow to the liver. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat liver failure.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of non alcoholic hepatitis including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis see Crespo et al. 2001 34 1158 Pessayre et al. 2002 282 2 G193 . The term nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH refers to the development of histologic changes in the liver that are comparable to those induced by excessive alcohol intake but in the absence of alcohol abuse. NASH is characterized by macrovesicular and or microvesicular steatosis lobular and portal inflammation and occasionally Mallory bodies with fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH is also commonly associated with hyperlipidemia obesity and type II diabetes mellitus.

Additional clinical conditions which characterize hepatic steatosis and inflammation include excessive fasting jejunoileal bypass total parental nutrition chronic hepatitis C Wilson s disease and adverse drug effects such as those from corticosteroids calcium channel blockers high dose synthetic estrogens methotrexate and amiodarone. Thus the term nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can be used to describe those patients who exhibit these biopsy findings coupled with the absence of a significant alcohol consumption b previous surgery for weight loss c history of drug use associated with steatohepatitis d evidence of genetic liver disease or e chronic hepatitis C infection see e.g. Ludwig et al. 1980 55 434 Powell et al. 1990 11 74 . In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat NASH.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of skin and nail disorders. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention comprising administering an induction dose of a TNF antibody followed by a subsequent treatment dose can be used to treat skin and nail disorders. The term skin disorder or skin disease as used interchangeably herein refers to abnormalities other than injury wounds of the skin which have induced a state of inflammation. In one embodiment the skin disorder of the invention is an inflammatory skin disorder wherein the skin is characterized by capillary dilatation leukocytic infiltration redness heat and or pain. Examples of skin disorders include but are not limited to psoriasis pemphigus vulgaris scleroderma atopic dermatitis sarcoidosis erythema nodosum hidradenitis suppurativa lichen planus Sweet s syndrome and vitiligo. As used herein the term skin and nail disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is intended to include skin and or nail disorders and other disorders in which the presence of TNF in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder e.g. psoriasis. Accordingly skin and nail disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental are disorders in which inhibition of TNF activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and or progression of the disorder. The use of the antibodies antibody portions and other TNF inhibitors of the invention in the treatment of specific skin and nail disorders is discussed further below. In certain embodiments the treatment method of the invention is performed in combination with another therapeutic agent as described below in Section IV. In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention comprising administering a TNF antibody in combination with another therapeutic agent is used for the treatment of psoriasis and the treatment of psoriasis associated with arthritis.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psoriasis Takematsu et al. 1989 281 398 Victor and Gottlieb 2002 1 264 . The term psoriasis as used herein refers to skin disorders associated with epidermal hyperplasia. Example of psoriasis include but are not limited to chronic plaque psoriasis guttate psoriasis inverse psoriasis pustular psoriasis psoriasis vulgaris and erythrodermic psoriasis. Psoriasis can also be associated with other inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease IBD and rheumatoid arthritis RA .

Psoriasis is described as a skin inflammation irritation and redness characterized by frequent episodes of redness itching and thick dry silvery scales on the skin. In particular lesions are formed which involve primary and secondary alterations in epidermal proliferation inflammatory responses of the skin and an expression of regulatory molecules such as lymphokines and inflammatory factors. Psoriatic skin is morphologically characterized by an increased turnover of epidermal cells thickened epidermis abnormal keratinization inflammatory cell infiltrates into the epidermis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte and lymphocyte infiltration into the epidermis layer resulting in an increase in the basal cell cycle. Psoriasis often involves the nails which frequently exhibit pitting separation of the nail thickening and discoloration. Psoriasis is often associated with other inflammatory disorders for example arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease IBD and Crohn s disease. Approximately one third of subjects with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis PsA which as described above causes stiffness swelling of the joints pain and reduced range of motion Greaves et al. 1995 332 581 .

Evidence of psoriasis is most commonly seen on the trunk elbows knees scalp skin folds or fingernails but it may affect any or all parts of the skin. Normally it takes about a month for new skin cells to move up from the lower layers to the surface. In psoriasis this process takes only a few days resulting in a build up of dead skin cells and formation of thick scales. Symptoms of psoriasis include skin patches that are dry or red covered with silvery scales raised patches of skin accompanied by red borders that may crack and become painful and that are usually located on the elbows knees trunk scalp and hands skin lesions including pustules cracking of the skin and skin redness joint pain or aching which may be associated with of arthritis e.g. psoriatic arthritis.

Treatment for psoriasis often includes a topical corticosteroids vitamin D analogs and topical or oral retinoids or combinations thereof. In one embodiment the TNF inhibitor of the invention is administered in combination with or the presence of one of these common treatments. Additional therapeutic agents which can also be combined with the TNF inhibitor of the invention for treatment of psoriasis are described in more detail in Section IV.

The diagnosis of psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin. Additionally a skin biopsy or scraping and culture of skin patches may be needed to rule out other skin disorders. An x ray may be used to check for psoriatic arthritis if joint pain is present and persistent.

Improvements in psoriasis in a subject can be monitored by the subject s Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score PASI . The method for determining the PASI has been described in Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978 157 238 and Marks et al. 1989 125 235. Briefly the index is based on evaluation of four anatomic sites including the head upper extremities trunk and lower extremities for erythema induration and desquamation using a 5 point scale 0 no symptoms 1 slight 2 moderate 3 marked 4 very marked . Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic site the area affected is assigned a numerical value 0 0 1 

In one embodiment of the invention a TNF inhibitor is used in multiple variable dose treatment for psoriasis including chronic plaque psoriasis guttate psoriasis inverse psoriasis pustular psoriasis pemphigus vulgaris erythrodermic psoriasis psoriasis associated with inflammatory bowel disease IBD and psoriasis associated with rheumatoid arthritis RA . In another embodiment a TNF inhibitor such as D2E7 is used in a multiple variable dose regimen to treat subjects who have psoriasis in combination with PsA. Specific types of psoriasis included in the treatment methods of the invention are described in detail below 

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic plaque psoriasis Asadullah et al. 1999 141 94 . Chronic plaque psoriasis also referred to as psoriasis vulgaris is the most common form of psoriasis. Chronic plaque psoriasis is characterized by raised reddened patches of skin ranging from coin sized to much larger. In chronic plaque psoriasis the plaques may be single or multiple they may vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. The plaques are usually red with a scaly surface and reflect light when gently scratched creating a silvery effect. Lesions which are often symmetrical from chronic plaque psoriasis occur all over body but with predilection for extensor surfaces including the knees elbows lumbosacral regions scalp and nails. Occasionally chronic plaque psoriasis can occur on the penis vulva and flexures but scaling is usually absent. Diagnosis of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis is usually based on the clinical features described above. In particular the distribution color and typical silvery scaling of the lesion in chronic plaque psoriasis are characteristic of chronic plaque psoriasis.

Guttate psoriasis refers to a form of psoriasis with characteristic water drop shaped scaly plaques. Flares of guttate psoriasis generally follow an infection most notably a streptococcal throat infection. Diagnosis of guttate psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin and the fact that there is often a history of recent sore throat.

Inverse psoriasis is a form of psoriasis in which the patient has smooth usually moist areas of skin that are red and inflammed which is unlike the scaling associated with plaque psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis is also referred to as intertiginous psoriasis or flexural psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis occurs mostly in the armpits groin under the breasts and in other skin folds around the genitals and buttocks and as a result of the locations of presentation rubbing and sweating can irriate the affected areas.

Pustular psoriasis also referred to as palmar plantar psoriasis is a form of psoriasis that causes pus filled blisters that vary in size and location but often occur on the hands and feet. The blisters may be localized or spread over large areas of the body. Pustular psoriasis can be both tender and painful can cause fevers.

Other examples of psoriatic disorders which can be treated with the TNF antibody of the invention include erythrodermic psoriasis vulgaris psoriasis associated with IBD and psoriasis associated with arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis.

Pemphigus vulgaris is a serious autoimmune systemic dermatologic disease that often affects the oral mucous membrane and skin. The pathogenesis of pemphigus vulgaris is thought to be an autoimmune process that is directed at skin and oral mucous membrane desmosomes. Consequentially cells do not adhere to each other. The disorder manifests as large fluid filled rupture prone bullae and has a distinctive histologic appearance. Anti inflammatory agents are the only effective therapy for this disease which has a high mortality rate. Complications that arise in patients suffering from pemphigus vulgaris are intractable pain interference with nutrition and fluid loss and infections.

Atopic dermatitis also referred to as eczema is a chronic skin disorder categorized by scaly and itching plaques. People with eczema often have a family history of allergic conditions like asthma hay fever or eczema. Atopic dermatitis is a hypersensitivity reaction similar to an allergy which occurs in the skin causing chronic inflammation. The inflammation causes the skin to become itchy and scaly. Chronic irritation and scratching can cause the skin to thicken and become leathery textured. Exposure to environmental irritants can worsen symptoms as can dryness of the skin exposure to water temperature changes and stress.

Subjects with atopic dermatitis can be identified by certain symptoms which often include intense itching blisters with oozing and crusting skin redness or inflammation around the blisters rash dry leathery skin areas raw areas of the skin from scratching and ear discharges bleeding.

Sarcoidosis is a disease in which granulomatous inflammation occurs in the lymph nodes lungs liver eyes skin and or other tissues. Sarcoidosis includes cutaneous sarcoidosis sarcoidosis of the skin and nodular sarcoidosis sarcoidosis of the lymph nodes . Patients with sarcoidosis can be identified by the symptoms which often include general discomfort uneasiness or an ill feeling fever skin lesions.

Erythema nodosum refers to an inflammatory disorder that is characterized by tender red nodules under the skin typically on the anterior lower legs. Lesions associated with erythema nodosum often begin as flat but firm hot red painful lumps approximately an inch across . Within a few days the lesions may become purplish and then over several weeks fade to a brownish flat patch.

In some instances erythema nodosum may be associated with infections including streptococcus coccidioidomycosis tuberculosis hepatitis B syphilis cat scratch disease tularemia yersinia leptospirosis psittacosis histoplasmosis mononucleosis EBV . In other instances erythema nodosum may be associated with sensitivity to certain medications including oralcontraceptives penicillin sulfonamides sulfones barbiturates hydantoin phenacetin salicylates iodides and progestin. Erythema nodosum is often associated with other disorders including leukemia sarcoidosis rheumatic fever and ulcerative colitis.

Symptoms of erythema nodosum usually present themselves on the shins but lesions may also occur on other areas of the body including the buttocks calves ankles thighs and upper extremities. Other symptoms in subjects with erythema nodosum can include fever and malaise.

Hidradenitis suppurativa refers to a skin disorder in which swollen painful inflamed lesions or lumps develop in the groin and sometimes under the arms and under the breasts. Hidradenitis suppurativa occurs when apocrine gland outlets become blocked by perspiration or are unable to drain normally because of incomplete gland development. Secretions trapped in the glands force perspiration and bacteria into surrounding tissue causing subcutaneous induration inflammation and infection. Hidradenitis suppurativa is confined to areas of the body that contain apocrine glands. These areas are the axillae areola of the nipple groin perineum circumanal and periumbilical regions.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of lichen planus Sklavounou et al. 2000 29 370 . Lichen planus refers to a disorder of the skin and the mucous membranes resulting in inflammation itching and distinctive skin lesions. Lichen planus may be associated with hepatitis C or certain medications.

Inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Sweet s syndrome Reuss Borst et al. 1993 84 356 . Sweet s syndrome which was described by R. D. Sweet in 1964 is characterized by the sudden onset of fever leukocytosis and cutaneous eruption. The eruption consists of tender erythematous well demarcated papules and plaques which show dense neutrophilic infiltrates microscopically. The lesions may appear anywhere but favor the upper body including the face. The individual lesions are often described as pseudovesicular or pseudopustular but may be frankly pustular bullous or ulcerative. Oral and eye involvement conjunctivitis or episcleritis have also been frequently reported in patients with Sweet s syndrome. Leukemia has also been associated with Sweet s syndrome.

Vitiligo refers to a skin condition in which there is loss of pigment from areas of skin resulting in irregular white patches with normal skin texture. Lesions characteristic of vitiligo appear as flat depigmented areas. The edges of the lesions are sharply defined but irregular. Frequently affected areas in subjects with vitiligo include the face elbows and knees hands and feet and genitalia.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of scleroderma Tutuncu et al. 2002 20 6 Suppl 28 S146 Mackiewicz et al. 2003 21 41 Murota et al. 2003 48 1117 . Scleroderma refers to a a diffuse connective tissue disease characterized by changes in the skin blood vessels skeletal muscles and internal organs. Scleroderma is also referred to as CREST syndrome or progressive systemic sclerosis and usually affects people between the ages 30 50. Women are affected more often than men.

The cause of scleroderma is unknown. The disease may produce local or systemic symptoms. The course and severity of the disease varies widely in those affected. Excess collagen deposits in the skin and other organs produce the symptoms. Damage to small blood vessels within the skin and affected organs also occurs. In the skin ulceration calcification and changes in pigmentation may occur. Systemic features may include fibrosis and degeneration of the heart lungs kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.

Patients suffering from scleroderma exhibit certain clinical features including blanching blueness or redness of fingers and toes in response to heat and cold Raynaud s phenomenon pain stiffness and swelling of fingers and joints skin thickening and shiny hands and forearm esophageal reflux or heartburn difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath. Other clinical symptoms used to diagnose scleroderma include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentaion rate ESR an elevated rheumatoid factor RF a positive antinuclear antibody test urinalysis that shows protein and microscopic blood a chest X ray that may show fibrosis and pulmonary funtion studies that show restricitive lung disease.

Nail disorders include any abnormality of the nail. The term nail disorder or nail disease as used herein refers to conditions wherein the fingernails or toenails to abnormal color shape texture or thickness. Specific nail disorders include but are not limited to pitting koilonychia Beau s lines spoon nails onycholysis yellow nails pterygium seen in lichen planus and leukonychia. Pitting is characterised by the presence of small depressions on the nail surface. Ridges or linear elevations can develop along the nail occurring in a lengthwise or crosswise direction. Beau s lines are linear depressions that occur crosswise transverse in the fingernail. Leukonychia describes white streaks or spots on the nails. Koilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail where the nail has raised ridges and is thin and concave Koilonychia is often associated with iron deficiency.

Nail disorders which can be treated with the TNF antibody of the invention also include psoriatic nails. Psoriatic nails include changes in nails which are attributable to psoriasis. In some instances psoriasis may occur only in the nails and nowhere else on the body. Psoriatic changes in nails range from mild to severe generally reflecting the extent of psoriatic involvement of the nail plate nail matrix i.e. tissue from which the nail grows nail bed i.e. tissue under the nail and skin at the base of the nail. Damage to the nail bed by the pustular type of psoriasis can result in loss of the nail. Nail changes in psoriasis fall into general categories that may occur singly or all together. In one category of psoriatic nails the nail plate is deeply pitted probably due to defects in nail growth caused by psoriasis. In another category the nail has a yellow to yellow pink discoloration probably due to psoriatic involvement of the nail bed. A third subtype of psoriatic nails are characterized by white areas which appear under the nail plate. The white areas are actually air bubbles marking spots where the nail plate is becoming detached from the nail bed. There may also be reddened skin around the nail. A fourth category is evidenced by the nail plate crumbling in yellowish patches i.e. onychodystrophy probably due to psoriatic involvement in the nail matrix. A fifth category is characterized by the loss of the nail in its entirety due to psoriatic involvement of the nail matrix and nail bed.

The multiple variable dose method of treatment of the invention can also be used to treat nail disorders often associated with lichen planus. Nails in subjects with lichen planus often show thinning and surface roughness of the nail plate with longitudinal ridges or pterygium.

The multiple variable dose method of treatment of the invention can be used to treat nail disorders such as those described herein. Often nail disorders are associated with skin disorders. In one embodiment the invention includes a multiple variable dose method of treatment for nail disorders using a TNF antibody. In another embodiment the nail disorder is associated with another disorder including a skin disorder such as psoriasis. In another embodiment the disorder associated with a nail disorder is arthritis including psoriatic arthritis.

The multiple variable dose method of treatment of the invention can be used to treat other skin and nail disorders such as chronic actinic dermatitis bullous pemphigoid and alopecia greata. Chronic actinic dermatitis CAD is also referred to as photosensitivity dermatitis actinic reticuloid syndrome PD AR . CAD is a condition in which the skin becomes inflamed particularly in areas that have been exposed to sunlight or artificial light. Commonly CAD patients have allergies to certain substances that come into contact with their skin particularly various flowers woods perfumes sunscreens and rubber compounds. Bullous pemphigoid refers to a skin disorder characterized by the formation of large blisters on the trunk and extremities. Alopecia areata refers to hair loss characterized by round patches of complete baldness in the scalp or beard.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of vasculitides see e.g. Deguchi et al. 1989 Lancet. 2 745 . In one embodiment the invention provides a multiple variable dose method for inhibiting TNF activity in a subject suffering from a vasculitis in which TNF activity is detrimental.

The term vasculitis or vasculitides as used interchangeably herein refers to a group of disorders which are characterized by the inflammation of blood vessels. Blood vessels of all sizes may be affected from the largest vessel in the body the aorta to the smallest blood vessels in the skin capillaries . The size of blood vessel affected varies according to the specific type of vasculitis. As used herein the term a vasculitis in which TNF activity is detrimental is intended to include vasculitis in which the presence of TNF in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced for example by an increase in the concentration of TNF in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder e.g. an increase in the concentration of TNF in serum plasma synovial fluid etc. of the subject which can be detected for example using an anti TNF antibody as described above.

There are numerous examples of vasculitides in which TNF activity is detrimental including Behcet s disease. The use of the antibodies antibody portions and other TNF inhibitors for multiple variable dose treatment of the invention of specific vasculitides is discussed further below. In certain embodiments the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor of the invention is administered to the subject in combination with another therapeutic agent as described below

The multiple variable dose regimen of the invention can be used to treat vasculitis in which TNF activity is detrimental wherein inhibition of TNF activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and or progression of the vasculitis or to prevent the vasculitis. Subjects suffering from or at risk of developing vasculitis can be identified through clinical symptoms and tests. For example subjects with vasculitides often develop antibodies to certain proteins in the cytoplasm of neutrophils antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA . Thus in some instances vasculitides may be evidenced by tests e.g. ELISA which measure ANCA presence.

Vasculitis and its consequences may be the sole manifestation of disease or it may be a secondary component of another primary disease. Vasculitis may be confined to a single organ or it may simultaneously affect several organs and depending on the syndrome arteries and veins of all sizes can be affected. Vasculitis can affect any organ in the body.

In vasculitis the vessel lumen is usually compromised which is associated with ischemia of the tissues supplied by the involved vessel. The broad range of disorders that may result from this process is due to the fact that any type size and location of vessel e.g. artery vein arteriole venule capillary can be involved. Vasculitides are generally classified according to the size of the affected vessels as described below. It should be noted that some small and large vessel vasculitides may involve medium sized arteries but large and medium sized vessel vasculitides do not involve vessels smaller than arteries. Large vessel disease includes but is not limited to giant cell arteritis also known as temporal arteritis or cranial arteritis polymyalgia rheumatica and Takayasu s disease or arteritis which is also known as aortic arch syndrome young female arteritis and Pulseless disease. Medium vessel disease includes but is not limited to classic polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki s disease also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. Non limiting examples of small vessel disease are Behcet s Syndrome Wegner s granulomatosis microscopic polyangitis hypersensitivity vasculitis also known as cutaneous vasculitis small vessel vasculitis Henoch Schonlein purpura allergic granulamotosis and vasculitis also known as Churg Strauss syndrome. Other vasculitides include but are not limited to isolated central nervous system vasculitis and thromboangitis obliterans also known as Buerger s disease. Classic Polyarteritis nodosa PAN microscopic PAN and allergic granulomatosis are also often grouped together and are called the systemic necrotizing vasculitides. A further description of vasculitis is described below 

In one embodiment the TNF antibody of the invention is used to treat subjects who have large vessel vasculitis. The term large vessel s as used herein refers to the aorta and the largest branches directed toward major body regions. Large vessels include for example the aorta and its branches and corresponding veins e.g. the subclavian artery the brachiocephalic artery the common carotid artery the innonimate vein internal and external jugular veins the pulmonary arteries and veins the venae cavae the renal arteries and veins the femoral arteries and veins and the carotid arteries. Examples of large vessel vasculitides are described below.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of giant cell arteritis Sneller 2002 69 SII40 Schett et al. 2002 61 463 . Giant cell arteritis GCA refers to a vasculitis involving inflammation and damage to blood vessels particularly the large or medium arteries that branch from the external carotid artery of the neck. GCA is also referred to as temporal arteritis or cranial arteritis and is the most common primary vasculitis in the elderly. It almost exclusively affects individuals over 50 years of age however there are well documented cases of patients 40 years and younger. GCA usually affects extracranial arteries. GCA can affect the branches of the carotid arteries including the temporal artery. GCA is also a systemic disease which can involve arteries in multiple locations.

Histopathologically GCA is a panarteritis with inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrates within the vessel wall with frequent Langhans type giant cell formation. There is proliferation of the intima granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. The pathological findings in organs is the result of ischemia related to the involved vessels.

Patients suffering from GCA exhibit certain clinical symptoms including fever headache anemia and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR . Other typical indications of GCA include jaw or tongue claudication scalp tenderness constitutional symptoms pale optic disc edema particularly chalky white disc edema and vision disturbances. The diagnosis is confirmed by temporal artery biopsy.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of polymyalgia rheumatica Straub et al. 2002 Oxford 41 423 Uddhammar et al. 1998 37 766 . Polymyalgia rheumatica refers to a rheumatic disorder that is associated with moderate to severe muscle pain and stiffness in the neck shoulder and hip most noticeable in the morning. IL 6 and IL 1 expression has also been detected in a majority of the circulating monocytes in patients with the polymyalgia rheumatica. Polymyalgia rheumatica may occur independently or it may coexist with or precede GCA which is an inflammation of blood vessels.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Takayasu s arteritis Kobayashi and Numano 2002 41 44 Fraga and Medina 2002 4 30 . Takayasu s arteritis refers to a vasculitis characterized by an inflammation of the aorta and its major branches. Takayasu s arteritis also known as Aortic arch syndrome young female arteritis and Pulseless disease affects the thoracic and abdominal aorta and its main branches or the pulmonary arteries. Fibrotic thickening of the aortic wall and its branches e.g. carotid inominate and subclavian arteries can lead to reduction of lumen size of vessels that arise from the aortic arch. This condition also typically affects the renal arteries.

Takayasu s arteritis primarily affects young women usually aged 20 40 years old particularly of Asian descent and may be manifested by malaise arthralgias and the gradual onset of extremity claudication. Most patients have asymmetrically reduced pulses usually along with a blood pressure differential in the arms. Coronary and or renal artery stenosis may occur.

The clinical features of Takayasu s arteritis may be divided into the features of the early inflammatory disease and the features of the later disease. The clinical features of the early inflammatory stage of Takayasu s disease are malaise low grade fever weight loss myalgia arthralgia and erythema multiforme. Later stages of Takayasu s disease are characterized by fibrotic stenosis of arteries and thrombosis. The main resulting clinical features are ischaemic phenomena e.g. weak and asymmetrical arterial pulses blood pressure discrepancy between the arms visual disturbance e.g. scotomata and hemianopia other neurological features including vertigo and syncope hemiparesis or stroke. The clinical features result from ischaemia due to arterial stenosis and thrombosis.

In one embodiment the TNF antibody of the invention is used to treat subjects who have medium vessel vasculitis. The term medium vessel s is used to refer to those blood vessels which are the main visceral arteries. Examples of medium vessels include the mesenteric arteries and veins the iliac arteries and veins and the maxillary arteries and veins. Examples of medium vessel vasculitides are described below.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of polyarteritis nodosa DiGirolamo et al. 1997 61 667 . Polyarteritis nodosa or periarteritis nodosa refers to vasculitis which is a serious blood vessel disease in which small and medium sized arteries become swollen and damaged because they are attacked by rogue immune cells. Polyarteritis nodosa usually affects adults more frequently than children. It damages the tissues supplied by the affected arteries because they don t receive enough oxygen and nourishment without a proper blood supply.

Symptoms which are exhibited in patients with polyarteritis nodosa generally result from damage to affected organs often the skin heart kidneys and nervous system. Generalized symptoms of polyarteritis nodosa include fever fatigue weakness loss of appetite and weight loss. Muscle aches myalgia and joint aches arthralgia are common. The skin of subjects with polyarteritis nodosa may also show rashes swelling ulcers and lumps nodular lesions .

Classic PAN polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic arteritis of small to medium muscular arteritis in which involvement of renal and visceral arteries is common. Abdominal vessels have aneurysms or occlusions in 50 of PAN patients. Classic PAN does not involve the pulmonary arteries although the bronchial vessels may be involved. Granulomas significant eosinophilia and an allergic diathesis are not part of the syndrome. Although any organ system may be involved the most common manifestations include peripheral neuropathy mononeuritis multiplex intestinal ischemia renal ischemia testicular pain and livedo reticularis.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Kawasaki s disease Sundel 2002 4 474 Gedalia 2002 4 25 . Although the cause of Kawasaki s disease is unknown it is associated with acute inflammation of the coronary arteries suggesting that the tissue damage associated with this disease may be mediated by proinflammatory agents such as TNF . Kawasaki s disease refers to a vasculitis that affects the mucus membranes lymph nodes lining of the blood vessels and the heart. Kawasaki s disease is also often referred to as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome mucocutaneous lymph node disease and infantile polyarteritis. Subjects afflicted with Kawasaki s disease develop vasculitis often involving the coronary arteries which can lead to myocarditis and pericarditis. Often as the acute inflammation diminishes the coronary arteries may develop aneurysm thrombosis and lead to myocardial infarction.

Kawasaki s disease is a febrile systemic vasculitis associated with edema in the palms and the soles of the feet with enlargement of cervical lymph nodes cracked lips and strawberry tongue . Although the inflammatory response is found in vessels throughout the body the most common site of end organ damage is the coronary arteries. Kawasaki s Disease predominantly affects children under the age of 5. The highest incidence is in Japan but is becoming increasingly recognized in the West and is now the leading cause of acquired heart disease in US children. The most serious complication of Kawasaki disease is coronary arteritis and aneurysm formation that occurs in a third of untreated patients.

In one embodiment the TNF antibody of the invention is used to treat subjects who have small vessel vasculitis. The term small vessel s is used to refer to arterioles venules and capillaries. Arterioles are arteries that contain only 1 or 2 layers of smooth muscle cells and are terminal to and continuous with the capillary network. Venules carry blood from the capillary network to veins and capillaries connect arterioles and venules. Examples of small vessel vasculitides are described below.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Behcet s disease Sfikakis 2002 61 ii51 3 Dogan and Farah 2002 52 23 . Behcet s disease is a chronic disorder that involves inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body. Behcet s disease may also cause various types of skin lesions arthritis bowel inflammation and meningitis inflammation of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord . As a result of Behcet s disease the subject with the disorder may have inflammation in tissues and organs throughout the body including the gastrointestinal tract central nervous system vascular system lungs and kidneys. Behcet s disease is three times more common in males than females and is more common in the eastern Mediterranean and Japan.

Subjects who have Behcet s disease may show clinical symptoms including recurrent oral ulcers resembling canker sores recurrent genital ulcers and eye inflammation. Serum levels of TNF IL 8 IL 1 IL 6 INF and IL 12 are elevated in Behcet s patients and the production of these factors has been shown to be elevated in the monocytes of Behcet s patients see e.g. 2001 Marcel Dekker Inc. eds. G. S. Hoffman and C. M. Weyand p. 473 .

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Wegener s granulomatosis Marquez et al. 2003 5 128 Harman and Margo 1998 42 458 .

Sinusitis and pulmonary infiltrates also occur in Churg Strauss syndrome primarily affecting the lung and heart. Peripheral neuropathy coronary arteritis and gastrointestinal involvement are common.

Patients afflicted with Churg Strauss syndrome can be diagnosed according to criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology ACR . These criteria were intended to distinguish CSS from other forms of vasculitis. Not all patients meet every criterion. Some in fact may have only 2 or 3 criteria yet they are still classified as Churg Strauss syndrome. The ACR selected 6 disease features criteria as being those that best distinguished Churg Strauss syndrome from other vasculitides. These criteria include 1 asthma 2 eosinophilia 10 on differential WBC count 3 mononeuropathy 4 transient pulmonary infiltrates on chest X rays 5 paranasal sinus abnormalities and 6 biopsy containing a blood vessel with extravascular eosinophils.

The term juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or JRA as used herein refers to a chronic inflammatory disease which occurs before age 16 that may cause joint or connective tissue damage. JRA is also referred to as juvenile chronic polyarthritis and Still s disease.

JRA causes joint inflammation and stiffness for more than 6 weeks in a child of 16 years of age or less. Inflammation causes redness swelling warmth and soreness in the joints. Any joint can be affected and inflammation may limit the mobility of affected joints. One type of JRA can also affect the internal organs.

JRA is often classified into three types by the number of joints involved the symptoms and the presence or absence of certain antibodies found by a blood test. These classifications help the physician determine how the disease will progress and whether the internal organs or skin is affected. The classifications of JRA include the following

a. Pauciarticular JRA wherein the patient has four or fewer joints are affected. Pauciarticular is the most common form of JRA and typically affects large joints such as the knees.

b. Polyarticular HRA wherein five or more joints are affected. The small joints such as those in the hands and feet are most commonly involved but the disease may also affect large joints.

c. Systemic JRA is characterized by joint swelling fever a light skin rash and may also affect internal organs such as the heart liver spleen and lymph nodes. Systemic JRA is also referred to as it Still s disease. A small percentage of these children develop arthritis in many joints and can have severe arthritis that continues into adulthood.

Antibodies antibody portions and other TNF inhibitors for use in the multiple variable dose methods of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Typically the pharmaceutical composition comprises an antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like that are physiologically compatible. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include one or more of water saline phosphate buffered saline dextrose glycerol ethanol and the like as well as combinations thereof. In many cases it is preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol sorbitol or sodium chloride in the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may further comprise minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents preservatives or buffers which enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor.

The compositions for use in the methods of the invention may be in a variety of forms. These include for example liquid semi solid and solid dosage forms such as liquid solutions e.g. injectable and infusible solutions dispersions or suspensions tablets pills powders liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions such as compositions similar to those used for passive immunization of humans with other antibodies or other TNF inhibitors. The preferred mode of administration is parenteral e.g. intravenous subcutaneous intraperitoneal intramuscular . In a preferred embodiment the antibody or other TNF inhibitor is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment the antibody or other TNF inhibitor is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.

Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution microemulsion dispersion liposome or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound i.e. antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption for example monostearate salts and gelatin.

Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. In certain embodiments an antibody or antibody portion for use in the methods of the invention is coformulated with and or coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic agents. For example an anti hTNF antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be coformulated and or coadministered with one or more DMARD or one or more NSAID or one or more additional antibodies that bind other targets e.g. antibodies that bind other cytokines or that bind cell surface molecules one or more cytokines soluble TNF receptor see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 94 06476 and or one or more chemical agents that inhibit hTNF production or activity such as cyclohexane ylidene derivatives as described in PCT Publication No. WO 93 19751 or any combination thereof. Furthermore one or more antibodies of the invention may be used in combination with two or more of the foregoing therapeutic agents. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents thus avoiding possible side effects complications or low level of response by the patient associated with the various monotherapies.

In one embodiment the invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of a TNF inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier wherein the effective amount of the TNF inhibitor may be effective to treat a TNF related disorder including for example Crohn s disease in a multiple variable dose regimen.

No. 10 222 140 incorporated by reference herein. This formulation includes a concentration 50 mg ml of the antibody D2E7 wherein one pre filled syringe contains 40 mg of antibody for subcutaneous injection.

The antibodies antibody portions and other TNF inhibitors of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art within the scope of the invention although for many therapeutic applications the preferred route mode of administration is subcutaneous injection. In another embodiment administration is via intravenous injection or infusion. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan the route and or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results within the scope of the invention. In certain embodiments the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release such as a controlled release formulation including implants transdermal patches and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable biocompatible polymers can be used such as ethylene vinyl acetate polyanhydrides polyglycolic acid collagen polyorthoesters and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. J. R. Robinson ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1978.

The TNF antibodies of the invention can also be administered in the form of protein crystal formulations which include a combination of protein crystals encapsulated within a polymeric carrier to form coated particles. The coated particles of the protein crystal formulation may have a spherical morphology and be microspheres of up to 500 micro meters in diameter or they may have some other morphology and be microparticulates. The enhanced concentration of protein crystals allows the antibody of the invention to be delivered subcutaneously. In one embodiment the TNF antibodies of the invention are delivered via a protein delivery system wherein one or more of a protein crystal formulation or composition is administered to a subject with a TNF related disorder. Compositions and methods of preparing stabilized formulations of whole antibody crystals or antibody fragment crystals are also described in WO 02 072636 which is incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment a formulation comprising the crystallized antibody fragments described in PCT IB03 04502 and U.S. application Ser.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may include a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention. A therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the antibody antibody portion other TNF inhibitor to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response e.g. a therapeutic or prophylactic response within the scope of the invention. For example a single bolus may be administered several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.

An exemplary non limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention is 10 to 200 mg more preferably 20 to 160 mg more preferably 40 to 80 mg and most preferably 80 mg. In one embodiment the therapeutically effective amount of an antibody or portion thereof for use in the methods of the invention is about 20 mg.

For example ranges of values using a combination of any of the above recited values as upper and or lower limits are intended to be included.

The invention provides a multiple variable dose method for treating a disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental comprising administering to a subject in need thereof at least one induction dose of a TNF inhibitor such as a human antibody such that a threshold level of TNF inhibitor is achieved within an induction phase and subsequently administering to the subject a treatment dose of the human antibody within a treatment phase such that treatment occurs.

The multiple variable dose treatment method of the invention comprises administering a therapeutic agent in an induction phase followed by a lower amount of the therapeutic agent during a treatment phase. In one embodiment the induction dose comprises either 160 mg or 80 mg. In another embodiment the induction dose ranges from about 20 to about 200 mg of a TNF inhibitor. More preferably the induction dose ranges from about 40 to about 160 mg of a TNF inhibitor. Most preferably the induction dose ranges from about 80 to about 160 mg of a TNF antibody. The induction phase is complete once a threshold level of therapeutic agent is reached. The induction phase can include a single induction dose or multiple induction doses wherein the same or different amounts of therapeutic agent are used. More than one induction dose may be administered during the induction phase wherein any determined amount of time interval may occur between induction doses including for example one hour apart one day apart one week apart two weeks apart etc. Examples of induction phase treatments of the invention used to achieve a threshold level of TNF inhibitor include but are not limited to the following regimens a 160 mg dose followed by an 80 mg dose at least one dose of 160 mg dose at least one dose of 80 mg dose at least two doses of 80 mg dose and two 80 mg induction doses at a one week interval.

A threshold level is achieved once a pre determined therapeutic effect is reached. For example the threshold level of a TNF inhibitor for the treatment of Crohn s disease may be determined by monitoring a subject in the induction phase of treatment for a reduction in their CDAI index. In another example the threshold level of a TNF inhibitor for treatment of psoriasis may be determined by a decrease in psoriatic plaques an improvement in the patient s Psoriasis Area Severity Index PASI score or an improved Physician s Global Assessment PGA score. In still another example the threshold level of a TNF inhibitor for treatment of a TNF related disorder is determined by achievement of a stable blood plasma serum concentration of the TNF inhibitor.

Once a threshold level is achieved the treatment phase is initiated. At least one treatment dose is administered during the treatment phase. More than one treatment dose may administered during the treatment phase wherein any determined amount of time interval may occur between induction doses including for example one hour apart one day apart one week apart two weeks apart etc. In one embodiment the treatment dose ranges from about 20 to about 120 mg of a TNF inhibitor. Most preferably the treatment dose ranges from about 40 to about 80 mg of a TNF inhibitor. In one embodiment the treatment phase comprises administering 40 mg of a TNF inhibitor. In another embodiment the treatment phase comprises administering 80 mg of a TNF inhibitor.

The multiple variable dose method described herein is based on a treatment regimen which includes administration of at least two different doses of a TNF inhibitor.

Studies were performed to determine the efficacy of a multiple variable dose regimen of a TNF inhibitor namely D2E7 also referred to as adalimumab and Humira for treating Crohn s disease CD . Efficacy and tolerability of D2E7 in the treatment of patients with active Crohn s disease were evaluated in the following randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter study. Another objective of the following study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of adalimumab ADA or D2E7 a fully human monoclonal antibody recognizing TNF following subcutaneous sc administration in patients with Crohn s disease. To assess the pharmacokinetics of adalimumab was determined a fully human monoclonal antibody TNF antagonist following subcutaneous sc administration over 4 weeks in patients with CD who participated in this study.

In this study two hundred ninety nine patients without previous exposure to TNF antagonists and with active Crohn s Disease were selected. The initial screening period lasted up to 14 days. Crohn s disease in each patient was confirmed by endoscopic or radiologic evaluation. Subjects were randomized equally to one of four treatment groups three treatment groups and one placebo group . The three treatment groups included a 40 mg dose at baseline week 0 followed by a 20 mg dose at week 2 n 74 an 80 mg dose at baseline followed by a 40 mg dose at week 2 n 75 and a 160 mg dose at baseline followed by an 80 mg dose at week 2 n 76 . The placebo group had 74 participants. Eligible subjects included men and women between 18 and 75 years of age having a diagnosis of Crohn s disease for more than four months. In addition selected patients had moderate to severely active Crohn s disease defined as a Crohn s Disease Activity Index CDAI score of 220 to 450 points. Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups. CDAI was equivalent across treatment groups and was representative of moderate to severely active CD.

At baseline Week 0 subjects received a loading dose of D2E7 followed by a treatment dose at Week 2 wherein the treatment dose was lower than the initial loading dose. Patients received one of the following multiple variable dose treatment regimens at Week 0 baseline and Week 2 Week 0 Week 2 160 mg 80 mg D2E7 80 mg 40 mg D2E7 40 mg 20 mg D2E7 or placebo placebo. Patients were administered D2E7 or placebo treatment subcutaneously.

Blood samples for determination of serum ADA concentrations were collected prior to dose at Week 0 and Week 2 and at the same time of the day as study drug had previously been administered at Week 1 and Week 4. Serum ADA concentrations were determined using a validated ELISA assay. Based on PK modeling higher dosing at Week 0 was expected to produce serum concentrations equivalent to values shown to be efficacious in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

The study was conducted for up to ten weeks including an initial two week screening period a four week treatment period Weeks 0 to 4 and a four week follow up period. Participants were evaluated for induction of clinical remission of Crohn s disease defined as a CDAI score of 

Efficacy of the multiple variable dose regimen was further measured according to improvements in the patient s Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire IBDQ score and improvements or remission of draining fistulas. Fistula remission was defined as closure of all fistulas that were draining at baseline for at least two consecutive visits. Fistula improvement was defined as a decrease of 50 in the number of draining fistula for at least two consecutive visits. C reactive protein CRP levels were also measured as CRP levels are reflective of inflammation in the body.

Statistical analysis was determined using chi square tests which were used for overall comparison of efficacy remission and clinical response among the three treatment groups two higher adalimumab doses and placebo and pair wise comparisons were used to compare each adalimumab dose and placebo. Descriptive statistics for serum adalimumab concentration data were also calculated.

A total of 299 patients entered the study and were randomized 284 95 completed the trial patients shown in Table 1 .

Results from the study show that multiple variable D2E7 dosage treatments were effective at inducing Crohn s disease remission. Table 2 shows the percentage of patients with clinical remission CDAI

The median 4 week changes in the CDAI index for each dose group points with data at both baseline and week 4 were as follows placebo 47 n 67 20 mg 73 n 70 40 mg 90 n 70 and 80 mg 101 n 73 . The decrease in the CDAI index for patients who received the multiple variable dose treatment of D2E7 is also shown in .

Clinical response results of CDAI 70 point and 100 point decrease from baseline at four weeks are shown in respectively. Significant increases in clinical response CDAI decrease of at least 70 or 100 points were also observed as shown in . All adalimumab treatment groups had a statistically significant clinical response of decreased CDAI scores from Baseline 70 points compared to placebo by Week 4 . About 50 of patients in the 160 80 mg treatment arm achieved a decrease in CDAI score from Baseline 100 points compared to 25 of placebo patients at Week 4 .

Thus patients who received multiple variable doses of D2E7 especially Crohn s patients receiving 80 40 mg and 160 80 mg showed a decrease in the CDAI index indicating remission of Crohn s disease.

In addition as shown in patients receiving the 160 80 mg dosing regimen showed the greatest decrease in CRP levels with the placebo group showing the least decrease. Patients also showed an overall improvement in their IBDQ score as shown in .

In addition sustained serum D2E7 concentrations were achieved early in treatment as a result of the multiple variable dose regimen. Serum ADA concentrations were available from 211 patients. Serum ADA concentrations increased proportionally with dose. Serum ADA concentrations were similar at Weeks 2 and 4 for each treatment indicating that the initial dose brings ADA concentrations to stable levels by Week 2 see Table 3 and . Mean SD serum ADA concentrations g mL at Weeks 1 2 and 4 among the 3 treatment arms were 40 20 mg arm 3.42 1.37 n 64 2.95 1.08 n 69 2.79 1.48 n 66 80 40 mg 7.00 2.89 n 68 5.57 2.42 n 68 5.65 3.06 n 65 and 160 80 mg 14.26 4.92 n 66 12.34 3.68 n 68 12.61 5.25 n 67 respectively.

The overall incidence of adverse events AE was low and did not differ among groups. The most common AE were injection site reactions most of which were mild. Statistically significant results were not dependent on baseline CRP concentration.

In sum multiple variable doses of D2E7 significantly increased the frequency of remission of disease and clinical response in Crohn s disease subjects. In combination 30 of subjects receiving D2E7 doses of 80 40 mg and 160 80 mg achieved remission in comparison to only 12 of placebo subjects. There was also a significant increase in the clinical response a decrease in the CDAI index of 70 points and IBDQ scores of the 40 mg and 80 mg treatment doses every other week compared to the placebo. In the treatment group receiving an 80 mg D2E7 treatment dose every other week 49 of the subjects achieved a clinical response a decrease in the CDAI of 100 points . Sustained serum adalimumab concentrations were achieved early in treatment due to the loading doses administered. Interestingly serum adalimumab concentrations in Crohn s patients administered the multiple variable dose regimen were comparable to levels shown to be efficacious in rheumatoid arthritis.

A study was performed to assess the tolerability and clinical benefit of a multiple variable dose treatment using a TNF inhibitor specifically D2E7 in adult patients with Crohn s disease who had previously received and responded to a different TNF inhibitor. The study included patients who had previously received the chimeric anti TNF antibody infliximab but who no longer have a sustained response and or tolerance to infliximab.

Patients who had lost responsiveness or developed intolerance acute or delayed infusion reactions were treated with D2E7 80 mg at week 0 and 40 mg at week 2. All treatments were subcutaneous. Antibodies to infliximab ATI were determined at baseline Prometheus Laboratories San Diego Calif. . Crohn s disease activity index CDAI scores presence of fistulas and C reactive protein CRP concentration were determined at weeks 0 and 4. Clinical response decrease in CDAI of 100 points clinical remission CDAI 50 of open fistulas complete fistula closure and acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions were recorded throughout the study.

Twenty four patients were enrolled and completed 4 weeks of the multiple variable dose therapy. Four of 16 patients 25 were positive for ATI. Of 13 patients with week 0 CDAI scores 220 6 46 achieved clinical response and 1 8 achieved remission at week 4. Of 6 patients with perianal and or rectovaginal fistulas 4 67 had fistula improvement and 3 50 had complete fistula closure at week 4. Only 6 patients 38 had CRP values above the normal range. Among all patients the mean SD CRP concentrations decreased from 17.0 29.3 mg L at week 0 to 11.3 17.3 mg L at week 4. No patients experienced acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions during treatment with D2E7 including 8 who previously experienced treatment limiting acute hypersensitivity reactions and 3 who previously experienced delayed hypersensitivity reactions with infliximab .

In sum multiple variable dose treatment using D2E7 was well tolerated and was clinically beneficial in patients with Crohn s disease who had previously received and responded to infliximab but who no longer had a sustained response to or could not tolerate infliximab.

A study was performed to determine the efficacy of a multiple variable dose regimen of D2E7 for treating psoriasis. Efficacy and tolerability of D2E7 in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis were evaluated in a randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter study.

In this study one hundred forty eight adult patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe psoriasis for at least one year were selected to receive multiple variable dose treatment. Patients were also selected based on an affected body surface area BSA of 5 . Subjects were randomized equally to one of three groups two treatment groups and one placebo .

At baseline Week 0 patients in both treatment groups received an induction dose of 80 mg of D2E7. Patients in the first treatment group subsequently received a treatment dose of 40 mg of D2E7 at week 1 followed by 40 mg every other week eow starting at week 3. Subjects in the second treatment group received an induction dose of 80 mg dose of D2E7 at Week 1 following the initial 80 mg dose at Week 0 followed by a treatment dose of 40 mg of D2E7 weekly starting at week 2. The placebo group received only the placebo weekly starting at baseline. All treatment was administered subcutaneously sc with pre filled syringes. A summary of the different regimens are described below in Table 4 

In order to maintain the blind study all subjects received a total of 2 injections at baseline and week 1. During the remaining period of the study weeks 2 through 12 subjects received one injection per week. The treatment dose per injection correlated to the dose regimen randomly assigned to each subject.

The PASI of the participants of the multiple variable dose regimen was determined according to standard methods see Fredriksson and Pettersson supra and Marls et al. supra . The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the percentage of subjects achieving a clinical response as defined by at least a 75 reduction in the PASI score PASI 75 at Week 12.

Secondary efficacy measures included a static Physician s Global Assessment PGA of clear or almost clear at Week 12. PGA was determined according to a seven point scale used to measure the severity of psoriasis at the time of the physician s evaluation. Descriptions of the disease used included the following severe very marked plaque elevation scaling and or erythema moderate to severe marked plaque elevation scaling and or erythema moderate moderate plaque elevation scaling and or erythema mild to moderate intermediate between moderate and mild mild slight plaque elevation scaling and or erythema almost clear intermediate between mild and clear and clear no signs of psoriasis.

The results show that at Week 12 statistically significantly greater percentages of patients achieved a PASI 75 response or better on D2E7 than those on a placebo treatment. For patients receiving 40 mg treatment dose of D2E7 eow 53 demonstrated a PASI of 75 or higher. In addition 80 of patients receiving a 40 mg treatment dose of D2E7 weekly showed a PASI 75 or higher compared to only 4 of the placebo treatment group p

Overall the mean percentage changes in PASI score for patients on D2E7 multiple variable dose therapy were statistically significantly greater than placebo. The changes were evident as early as Week 1 after the initial dose as shown in . At Week 12 49 of patients on D2E7 receiving 40 mg eow and 76 of patients receiving 40 mg of D2E7 weekly achieved a PGA of clear or almost clear compared with 2 of placebo patients.

Of the one hundred forty eight adult patients enrolled in the study 29 also had a medical history of psoriatic arthritis PsA . Both doses of D2E7 were effective in the treatment of psoriasis in both patients with and without PsA. Patients with PsA had a similar efficacy response to D2E7 as those without PsA. For both PsA and without PsA subgroups the percentages of patients achieving a PASI 75 response or better at week 12 was statistically significant for the eow with PsA 47 without PsA 57 and weekly treatment arms with PsA 58 without PsA 87 compared with placebo. Continued improvements in efficacy were seen through week 24 in the eow arm with PsA 53 without PsA 70 . Efficacy responses in patients with and without PsA at weeks 12 and 24 are shown in respectively.

In conclusion D2E7 administered for 12 weeks was effective in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 53 of patients on 40 mg eow achieved PASI 75 compared with 4 on placebo. 80 of patients on 40 mg weekly achieved PASI 75.49 and 76 of patients on D2E7 40 mg eow and 40 mg weekly respectively were clear or almost clear of their psoriasis. In addition D2E7 was equally effective at treating psoriasis patients with and without PsA.

A study was performed to determine the efficacy of a single dose regimen of D2E7 for treating rheumatoid arthritis RA . The objective of the study was to determine and compare the single dose safety and efficacy of 3 subcutaneous sc doses 20 40 or 80 mg of D2E7 in Japanese and Caucasian subjects with RA.

D2E7 was administered as single sc doses 20 40 or 80 mg in 40 Japanese in Japan and 36 Caucasian in US subjects with RA well matched for moderate to severe baseline disease severity in 2 separate clinical studies of similar design open label parallel group. On Study Days 1 15 and 29 safety evaluations included physical examinations vital signs and laboratory assessments to determine adverse events AEs and efficacy evaluations included CRP Physician s and Subject s Assessment of Disease Activity Subject s Assessment of Pain Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire DIHAQ and tender and swollen joint counts.

Results from the study showed that all Japanese treatment groups had statistically significant improvements of all ACR components except DIHAQ on Day 15 and on Day 29 compared to Day 1. In the 3 Caucasian treatment groups only the 80 mg treatment group exhibited a statistically significant improvement at Day 29 in all individual ACR components with the exception of the DIHAQ score. Although the study duration was only 29 days ACR20 responses were achieved in 47.5 19 40 of the Japanese patients and in 30.6 11 36 of the Caucasian patients. In addition the difference in frequency of subjects reporting AEs between treatment groups was not clinically relevant within each study. Interestingly there was an increased incidence of AEs in Japanese subjects which may reflect racial differences or investigator cultural tendency to report.

The results demonstrate an improvement of comparable magnitude in RA signs and symptoms in both groups in this short term study using a single dose treatment. These results also suggest similar safety of single dose sc administration of ADA in Japanese and Caucasian subjects.
