Enterprises increasingly rely on enterprise applications to allow their users e.g. employees to access enterprise information and processes. In turn users execute such enterprise applications on an increasing number and variety of client computing devices. Such client computing devices vary widely some may be standardized enterprise issued devices and others may be personally owned consumer devices such as personal smartphones tablets or laptop computers. Additionally the method of application development delivery and consumption varies between native applications web based applications software as a service HTML 5 and hybrid applications.

To facilitate use of such consumer devices in the enterprise context the consumer devices typically must be completely managed by the enterprise or completely unmanaged. Requiring enterprise management of user owned consumer devices may be inconvenient to users or impractical for enterprise information technology staff along with presenting other privacy and regulatory issues. However allowing unmanaged devices access to enterprise networks may compromise security of the enterprise.

The enterprise data may be embodied as any type of data storage capable of performing the functions described herein including integrated data storage of one or more enterprise servers storage area networks cloud storage systems or the like. In some embodiments the enterprise data may be stored in data storage of the enterprise policy server .

Referring now to in an illustrative embodiment the client computing device establishes an environment during operation. The illustrative environment includes one or more enterprise applications a trust agent module and a security management module . The various modules of the environment may be embodied as hardware firmware software or a combination thereof.

The enterprise applications include any application that the user executes to perform enterprise related tasks and that may access the enterprise data . The enterprise applications may include native applications applications executed within a runtime environment e.g. a Java Runtime Environment JRE or a Common Language Runtime CLR and web applications. For example enterprise applications may include custom line of business applications customer relations management applications and commercial off the shelf productivity applications that access enterprise data .

The trust agent module is configured to collect device attribute information about the client computing device and send such device attribute information to the enterprise policy server . The device attribute information may include any information that identifies or describes the hardware software or other environments of the client computing device . As described in detail below such device attribute information is used by the enterprise policy server to determine a device trust level for the client computing device . The trust agent module may use features of the security processor to ensure the integrity of the device attribute information.

The security management module is configured to receive security policies from the enterprise policy server and to manage policy based secure containers for the enterprise applications . The security management module manages a group of policy based secure containers which are sometimes referred to herein as simply secure containers. Each secure container is associated with a security policy and with one or more of the enterprise applications . Each security policy includes a set of rules defining the allowed behavior of the enterprise applications executed in the corresponding secure container . As the enterprise applications execute the secure containers enforce the associated security policy . Thus each secure container is a policy enforcement point. Although the illustrated security management module includes only two secure containers the security management module may include one two or more secure containers in other embodiments.

Referring now to in one embodiment the enterprise policy server establishes an environment during operation. The illustrative environment includes a trust calculation module a policy determination module and a plurality of security policies . Although illustrated as resident on a single enterprise policy server in some embodiments the trust calculation module and the policy determination module may reside on different server computing device servers. The various modules of the environment may be embodied as hardware firmware software or a combination thereof.

The trust calculation module is configured to receive device attribute information from the client computing device and to calculate a device trust level based on the device attribute information. Such calculation may be performed by for example looking up the device trust level in a data table indexed by the device attribute information calculating the device trust level based on a pre defined algorithm or function and or other device trust level calculation or determination procedures. The various device trust levels may be assigned according to enterprise policy.

The policy determination module is configured to receive a request for access to an enterprise application from the client computing device determine a security policy based on the device trust level and a data sensitivity level associated with the enterprise application and send the security policy to the client computing device . Such security policy may be selected from the plurality of security policies which are predefined according to enterprise policy. In some embodiments the plurality of security policies may be applicable across the entire enterprise. In other embodiments the plurality of security policies may be specific to the enterprise data or to one or more particular subsets of the enterprise data . In some embodiments the plurality of security policies may be defined dynamically or at runtime.

Referring now to in use the client computing device may execute a method for providing policy based secure containers for multiple enterprise applications. In block the client computing device determines whether a request for access to an enterprise application session has been received from the user. Such request may occur as the user begins a work session using the enterprise application . In some embodiments such request may occur prior to the user work session for example when an enterprise application is installed on or otherwise provisioned to the client computing device . If no enterprise application request is received the method loops back to block to continue monitoring for application requests. If however an enterprise application request is received the method advances to block .

In block the client computing device receives the request from the user to initiate an enterprise application session. Such request may identify the enterprise application that the user wishes to execute. As discussed above the enterprise application is executed by the user to accomplish enterprise related tasks and may access the enterprise data . In some embodiments the request to initiate the enterprise application session may be embodied as a standard method for invoking an application on the client computing device such as selecting an icon or selecting an item from a menu. Therefore the user may access the enterprise application using a single action that is consistent with the native user experience of the client computing device .

In block the client computing device sends device attribute information to the enterprise policy server . As discussed above the device attribute information may include any information identifying or describing the hardware of the client computing device the operating system of the client computing device and or other software environment of the client computing device . For example the device attribute information may include information describing an International Mobile Station Equipment Identity IMEI used to identify certain mobile communication devices associated with the client computing device the device type of the client computing device e.g. computer tablet handset etc. the operating system installed on the client computing device the particular version of the operating system the serial number of the client computing device whether the client computing device is managed by a mobile device management system whether the user of the client computing device has privileged control of the operating system i.e. root access and or whether the computing device includes a security processor . As described in detail below the enterprise policy server determines the trust level for the client computing device based on the supplied device attribute information. Other device attribute information may include the network transport s available to the client computing device the location of the client computing device and the identity and version of software installed on the client computing device . Although illustrated as being sent during every execution of the method in some embodiments the device attribute information may be sent to the enterprise policy server a single time which may occur prior to the enterprise application request. In such embodiments the client computing device may send identifying information to associate with the device attribute information already sent.

As described above the trust agent module may use features of the security processor to ensure the integrity of the device attribute information. For example the trust agent module may employ code signing or other cryptographic techniques supported by the security processor to ensure that various software components of the client computing device have not been altered. In some embodiments the trust agent module may execute in a secure or isolated execution environment of the security processor . In other embodiments the security processor may supply trusted measurements of the client computing device or its software environment from which the device attribute information may be derived.

In block the client computing device sends a request to the enterprise policy server for access to the enterprise application requested by the user. The request for access to the enterprise application corresponds to the user request to initiate an application session. The enterprise application may be identified by a name a globally unique identifier GUID a uniform resource indicator URI a uniform resource locator URL and or the like. As described in detail below the enterprise policy server determines a data sensitivity level based on the requested enterprise application . Although blocks and are illustrated as executing sequentially in other embodiments the operations of blocks and may occur in any order or contemporaneously. For example the device attribute information and the request for access to the enterprise application may be sent to the enterprise policy server in the same request.

In block the client computing device receives a security policy from the enterprise policy server . As described above the security policy includes a set of rules controlling the behavior of the enterprise application . The security policy may include rules governing authentication data encryption interprocess communication logging auditing and or the like.

For example referring to a block diagram illustrates one possible security policy schema . The security policy schema defines attributes rules and associated values that may be assigned to a security policy . The illustrative schema includes a device trust level and a data sensitivity level which are described in detail below with respect to the and the enterprise policy server . The schema also includes illustrative rules . Illustrative rule defines the required authentication method specifying potential authentication methods of no authentication one factor authentication or two factor authentication. That is in some embodiments multi factor authentication may be required. Illustrative rule defines whether encryption is required for application data or not. Illustrative rule defines whether application data must be removed after the application exits or not. Illustrative rule defines whether logging and auditing is required or not and may define logging and auditing options. Illustrative rule defines whether communication is allowed between applications of the same security policy or not and may define communication options specifying particular communications to allow or disallow e.g. encrypted communications network connections shared memory cut and paste etc. . The security policy may include additional or different rules from those illustrated in schema .

Referring back to in block the client computing device determines a policy based secure container for the received security policy . To make such determination the client computing device compares the trust level and data sensitivity level assigned to the security policy to other security policies for existing secure containers . In some embodiments the client computing device also compares rules of the security policy to rules of the other security policies . The client computing device may find a matching secure container among the existing secure containers . If not the client computing device determines that a secure container must be created for the security policy . As such in block the client computing device determines whether a secure container currently exists for the newly received security policy. If so the method advances to block . However if no secure container currently exists for the newly received security policy the method advances to block in which the client computing device constructs a new secure container for the newly received security policy . The newly constructed secure container is associated to the security policy . After constructing the secure container the method advances to block .

In block the client computing device adds the enterprise application to the secure container . Such secure container may be pre existing as determined in block or newly constructed in block . By adding the enterprise application to the secure container the client computing device establishes a session for the enterprise application . Where the secure container is pre existing the enterprise application is therefore added to a preexisting session.

In some embodiments as discussed above the enterprise application may be previously installed on the client computing device . In other embodiments the client computing device may receive the enterprise application from the enterprise policy server . In other embodiments the client computing device may download the enterprise application from a remote server other than the enterprise policy server for example a web server or a centralized application repository i.e. an app store .

In block the client computing device executes the enterprise application in the secure container . In some embodiments the secure container may be implemented as a native application of the client computing device that provides security and auditing services to the enterprise application . Such security and auditing services may include secure communication authentication and event logging. For example the secure container may provide an application programming interface API for such security and auditing services and the enterprise application may be designed to interface with the API of the secure container . In such embodiments the enterprise application may be specially compiled and or packaged to execute in the secure container . Such packaging may include encrypting the enterprise application and or its associated data. At runtime the secure container wraps the enterprise application that is the enterprise application requests enterprise data and communicates with other applications by invoking the secure container which handles those requests and communication. In some embodiments the enterprise application may further be executed in a secure execution environment which may be provided using the security processor .

In other embodiments the secure container replaces or abstracts services typically provided by an operating system of the client computing device . For example in some embodiments the secure container is implemented as a shim that intercepts system calls made by the enterprise application performs security and auditing services and then passes the calls to the operating system of the client computing device as specified by the security policy . Such embodiments may not require any modifications to the enterprise application particular to the secure container allowing the use of commercial or off the shelf applications not specifically designed for use with the secure container . Such embodiments of the secure container may require special permission or integration with the operating system of the client computing device . In some embodiments the secure container may use security or auditing features provided by the client computing device and thus may not require special permission or integration with the operating system.

As described above in some embodiments the enterprise application may execute in a runtime environment of the client computing device such as an interpreted runtime environment or a just in time compiled runtime environment. Accordingly the secure container may be embodied as such a runtime environment of the client computing device or as an extension of such runtime environment. As with native applications the enterprise application may be designed to invoke an API of the secure container or the secure container may transparently intercept and handle calls to the runtime environment.

Also as described above in some embodiments the enterprise application may be a web application. In such embodiments the secure container may include a web browser environment. For example the secure container may embed a standard web browser control provided by the client computing device or may include a custom or standalone web browser environment. The enterprise application executes in the web browser environment of the secure container . As with native and runtime environment applications the enterprise application may be designed to invoke an API that the secure container provides through the web browser environment or the secure container may transparently intercept and handle calls to the web browser environment.

As described above the secure container may contain one or more enterprise applications . Such enterprise applications may be of different types. That is the secure container may contain any combination of native applications runtime applications and web applications.

In block the client computing device enforces the security policy using the secure container . As described above the secure container is configured to evaluate actions of the enterprise application and perform operations as specified in the security policy . For example enforcing the security policy may prevent the enterprise application from communicating with other applications or entities running outside of the secure container . The client computing device may however allow secure communication among enterprise applications executing within the same secure container . The client computing device may enforce authentication requirements of the security policy prior to allowing access to the enterprise application . Because a single session is shared for each secure container the client computing device may enforce authentication requirements for each secure container and not for each enterprise application meaning that additional authentication may not be required for an enterprise application added to an already existing secure container . The security policy may define a session time limit after which time limit has expired the user is required to reauthenticate. In some embodiments the client computing device may require the user to authenticate to an enterprise authentication server not illustrated . Additionally or alternatively the client computing device may encrypt data stored or accessed by the enterprise application . The client computing device may also delete data stored by the enterprise application after the enterprise application exits. The client computing device may log events performed by the enterprise application for auditing purposes. In some embodiments the client computing device may deny access to the enterprise application altogether based on the security policy . After block the method loops back to block to receive additional user requests for enterprise application sessions. Thus multiple enterprise applications may be requested added and executed in the secure container .

Referring now to in use the enterprise policy server may execute a method for providing secure containers for multiple enterprise applications . The method begins with block in which the enterprise policy server monitors for a request from the client computing device for access to an enterprise application session. As described above with relation to block such request may result from a user of the client computing device initiating a work session or from an enterprise application being installed on or otherwise provisioned to the client computing device . If no enterprise application request is received the method continues to monitor for requests at block . If an enterprise application request is received the method advances to block .

In block the enterprise policy server receives device attribute information from the client computing device . As described above with respect to block the device attribute information may be embodied as or otherwise include any information identifying or describing the hardware of the client computing device the operating system of the client computing device and or other software environment of the client computing device . The client computing device may send the device attribute information in response to a user request for access to an enterprise application . In other embodiments the client computing device may send the device attribute information prior to the enterprise application request. In such embodiments the enterprise policy server may store the device attribute information until the enterprise application request is received.

In block the enterprise policy server determines a client device trust level for the client computing device based on the device attribute information. To perform this trust level calculation the enterprise policy server may reference a table of trust levels indexed by device attribute information. For example a client computing device running a recent version of the iOS operating system in conjunction with a mobile device management service may be assigned a high trust level i.e. level TL3 . A client computing device running a registered version of the Android operating system may be assigned a medium trust level i.e. level TL2 . A client computing device running an unknown or unregistered operating system may be assigned a low default trust level i.e. level TL1 . The device trust level may depend on other device attribute information including IMEI device type serial number mobile device management status whether the user has root access and the like. Such device trust level assignments may be predefined according to enterprise policy.

In block the enterprise policy server receives a request for access to an enterprise application from the client computing device . As described above with respect to block such request may identify the enterprise application by name globally unique identifier GUID uniform resource identifier URI uniform resource locator URL or the like. The enterprise policy server identifies the requested enterprise application based on data in the request. Although illustrated as being executed sequentially the operations of blocks and may be executed in any order or contemporaneously. For example the enterprise policy server may receive the device attribute information and the enterprise application request in the same communication from the client computing device .

In block the enterprise policy server determines a data sensitivity level for the requested enterprise application . The enterprise data is pre classified and each subset of the enterprise data is pre associated to a particular data sensitivity level according to enterprise policy. The enterprise policy server determines what subset of the enterprise data may be accessed by the enterprise application and looks up the associated data sensitivity level for this enterprise data . For example publicly accessible information may have a low sensitivity level confidential corporate information e.g. financial or product information may have a medium sensitivity level and sensitive content e.g. regulated content may have a high sensitivity level.

In block the enterprise policy server determines a security policy based on the device trust level and the data sensitivity level. Each security policy included in the plurality of security policies includes a particular trust level and data sensitivity level. The enterprise policy server may search the plurality of security policies for a security policy with matching device trust level and data sensitivity level. For example referring to the illustrative security policy schema includes device trust level and data sensitivity level . The device trust level has potential values TL1 TL2 and TL3. The data sensitivity level has potential values low medium and high. Accordingly assuming the device trust level is determined to be TL3 and the data sensitivity level is determined to be high the enterprise policy server searches the plurality of security policies for a security policy having device trust level TL3 and data sensitivity level high. The security policy includes a set of rules controlling the behavior of the enterprise application as described above with respect to block of . As described above in other embodiments the enterprise policy server may derive a security policy at runtime based on the device trust level and the data sensitivity level .

Referring back to in block the enterprise policy server sends the security policy to the client computing device . In some embodiments the enterprise policy server may also send the enterprise application to the client computing device . As described above the client computing device references or creates a secure container for the security policy executes the enterprise application and enforces the security policy . After sending the security policy the method loops back to block to wait for additional enterprise application requests.

Example 1 includes a client computing device for applying enterprise policies to applications. The client computing device includes a trust agent module to send device attribute information that identifies attributes of the client computing device to an enterprise policy server and a security management module to send a request for an enterprise application to the enterprise policy server in response to receiving a user request for a session with the enterprise application receive a security policy for the enterprise application from the enterprise policy server in response to sending the device attribute information and the request for access to the enterprise application determine whether a secure container exists on the client computing device for the security policy construct the secure container on the client computing device for the security policy in response to determining the secure container does not exist and add the enterprise application to the secure container wherein the secure container is to enforce the security policy while the enterprise application is executed on the client computing device.
