This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 509 853 filed Jul. 20 2011 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention pertains to 4 amino N 3 diethylamino propyl 3 4 3 fluorophenyl carbamoyl aminophenyl thieno 3 2 c pyridine 7 carboxamide which inhibits protein kinases such as Aurora kinases and the VEGFR and PDGFR families of kinases and which has an improved aqueous solubility profile compositions containing 4 amino N 3 diethylamino propyl 3 4 3 fluorophenyl carbamoyl aminophenyl thieno 3 2 c pyridine 7 carboxamide and methods of treating diseases using 4 amino N 3 diethylamino propyl 3 4 3 fluorophenyl carbamoyl aminophenyl thieno 3 2 c pyridine 7 carboxamide.

Mitosis is a process by which a complete copy of a duplicated genome is segregated by the microtuble spindle apparatus into two daughter cells. Aurora kinases key mitotic regulators required for genome stability have been found to be overexpressed in human tumors. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which inhibit Aurora kinases compositions comprising the inhibitors and methods of treating diseases during which Aurora kinases are unregulated or overexpressed.

The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is one of the primary biochemical mechanisms mediating eukaryotic cell signaling. This reaction is catalyzed by protein kinases that transfer the g phosphate group of ATP to hydroxyl groups on target proteins. 518 such enzymes exist in the human genome of which 90 selectively catalyze the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxyl groups Cytosolic tyrosine kinases reside intracellularly whereas receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs possess both extracellular and intracellular domains and function as membrane spanning cell surface receptors. As such RTKs mediate the cellular responses to environmental signals and facilitate a broad range of cellular processes including proliferation migration and survival.

RTK signaling pathways are normally highly regulated yet their over activation has been shown to promote the growth survival and metastasis of cancer cells. Dysregulated RTK signaling occurs through gene over expression or mutation and has been correlated with the progression of various human cancers.

The VEGF receptor VEGFR family consists of three RTKs KDR kinase insert domain containing receptor VEGFR2 FLT1 Fms like tyrosine kinase VEGFR1 and FLT4 VEGFR3 . These receptors mediate the biological function of the vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF A B C D E and placenta growth factor P1GF a family of homodimeric glycoproteins that bind the VEGF receptors with varying affinities.

KDR is the major mediator of the mitogenic angiogenic and permeability enhancing effects of VEGF A hereafter referred to as VEGF. Many different cell types are able to produce VEGF yet its biological activity is limited predominately to the vasculature by way of the endothelial cell selective expression of KDR. Not surprisingly the VEGF KDR axis is a primary mediator of angiogenesis the means by which new blood vessels are formed from preexisting vessels.

FLT1 binds VEGF VEGF B and placental growth factor. FLT1 is expressed on the surface of smooth muscle cells monocytes and hematopoietic stems cells in addition to endothelial cells. Activation of FLT1 signaling results in the mobilization of marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells that are recruited to tumors where they contribute to new blood vessel formation.

FLT4 mediates the signaling of VEGF C and VEGF D which mediate formation of tumor associated lymphatic vessels lymphangiogenesis . Lymphatic vessels are one of the routes by which cancer cells disseminate from solid tumors during metastasis.

The a and b isoforms of the platelet derived growth factor PDGF receptors occur as homodimers or a b heterodimers and are found most commonly on the surface of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. PDGFR b contributes to tumor angiogenesis through the proliferation and migration of pericytes the peri endothelial cells that associate with and stabilize immature blood vessels. In gliomas autocrine PDGFR stimulation brought about by the co expression of PDGF and PDGF receptors mediates tumor cell proliferation and survival.

CSF 1R is encoded by the cellular homolog of the retroviral oncogene v fms and is a major regulator of macrophage development. Macrophages are frequent components of tumor stroma and have been shown to modify the extracellular matrix in a manner beneficial to tumor growth and metastasis.

KIT is expressed by hematopoietic progenitor cells mast cells germ cells and by pacemaker cells in the gut interstitial cells of Cajal . It contributes to tumor progression by two general mechanisms namely autocrine stimulation by its ligand stem cell factor SCF and through mutations that result in ligand independent kinase activity.

FLT3 is normally expressed on hematopoietic stem cells where its interaction with FLT3 ligand FL stimulates stem cell survival proliferation and differentiation. In addition to being over expressed in various leukemia cells FLT3 is frequently mutated in hematological malignancies with approximately one third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML harboring activating mutations.

The identification of effective small compounds which specifically inhibit signal transduction and cellular proliferation by modulating the activity of tyrosine kinases to regulate

and modulate abnormal or inappropriate cell proliferation differentiation or metabolism is therefore desirable. In particular the identification of methods and compounds that specifically

inhibit the function of a tyrosine kinase which is essential for angiogenic processes or the formation of vascular hyperpermeability leading to edema ascites effusions exudates and macromolecular extravasation and matrix deposition as well as associated disorders would be beneficial.

While thienopyridine compounds disclosed in WO2005 010009 display potent inhibition of Aurora and PDGFR VEGFR kinases they may also have limited aqueous solubility which makes intravenous formulations difficult. 4 Amino N 3 diethylamino propyl 3 4 3 fluorophenyl carbamoyl aminophenyl thieno 3 2 c pyridine 7 carboxamide inhibits protein kinases such as Aurora kinases and the VEGFR and PDGFR families of kinases and displays an improved aqueous solubility profile.

Sufficient solubility in the vehicle is essential for the development of an IV formulation. Low solubility limits the maximum dose that can be delivered in the restricted volume of an injectable formulation and may result in precipitation of the compound at the inject site. In many cases a high organic solvent content and complex formulations are required to solubilize compounds with low aqueous solubility. Therefore increasing the solubility of compounds may alleviate these risks associated with low solubility and moreover constitute an advantage.

The incubations consisted of human liver microsomal protein at 0.4 mg ml in 100 mM KPObuffer 125 uM NADPH and Regeneration mix in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4.

An ICcurve was calculated for each compound control tested as compared to vehicle DMSO the uninhibited reaction.

The inhibition for each concentration in each well was calculated 100 1 Corr Response High Control where the corr response final read pre read and high control is the raw corrected avg of DMSO. The inhibition for each concentration in each well is calculated 100 1 Response High Control no corrections are needed as no pre read was taken The 6 values inhibition for each compound were then fit to a curve using an enzyme kinetic sigmoidal hill slope fit analysis in our data analysis package using inhibition to calculate an IC. If there was no curve or if the curve did not reach 50 inhibition the ICwas reported as 20 M for the test compounds. For compounds that show inhibition both the ICand the highest inhibition was reported with an emphasis on the inhibition.

The data in tables 2 3 and 4 illustrate the utility of the compound of this invention as an inhibitor of multiple kinases with the added benefit of reduced CYP inhibition.

Compounds described as having low CYP inhibition or as not inhibiting CYP are those compounds with an ICof 10 M in the above assay.

Chemiluminescent nitrogen detection CLND method oxidized the analyte to nitrogen oxide that reacted with ozone to provide a photon of light and was a measure of how much compound was in solution. Compounds must contain nitrogens for this experiment. Nitrogen impurities present in the compound will cause falsely high results.

The solubility was determined by comparing the reading generated by analysis of the sample to the standard curve. The value was then divided by the number of nitrogens contained in the compound. Corrections for impurities during the synthesis were included in the number of nitrogens. The resulting value was the reported solubility.

Aqueous pH 7.4 and PEG 300 samples were tested at 25 C. Excess amount of the bulk drug was weighed out and mixed with an aliquot of target media in a clear glass vial n 3 solvent . The vial was capped wrapped with aluminum foil and tumbled in a 25 C. water bath. When equilibration was completed the samples were removed from the water bath and the final pH was measured if applicable. The samples were centrifuged at 25 C. at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was filtered through 4 mm 0.45 m PTFE syringe filters. The filtrate was assayed after appropriate dilution no dilution required for aqueous samples . The concentration of the sample was calculated against a calibration curve for the compound.

Solubility in pH 7.4 buffer was carried out as described above except samples were not centrifuged before filtration. All other experimental steps were the same. PEG 300 and PEG 400 solubility were done at ambient temperature. Excess amount of the bulk drug was weighed out and mixed with an aliquot of target media in a clear glass vial with a small stir bar n 3 . The vials were placed on the stirrer at 500 rpm and allowed to equilibrate over the weekend. Samples were filtered through 13 mm 0.45 m GHP syringe filters. The filtrate was assayed after appropriate dilutions and concentrations determined against a calibration curve for the compound.

The data in Table 5 shows the increased aqueous solubility of 4 amino N 3 diethylamino propyl 3 4 3 fluorophenyl carbamoyl aminophenyl thieno 3 2 c pyridine 7 carboxamide as compared to Example 2 3 and 4 found in WO2005 010009.

Example 2 with a carboxamide group on the 7 position of the thieno 3 2 c pyridine ring system demonstrates extremely low aqueous solubility. Substitution at the carboxamide to introduce amine functionality had no effect on solubility in Example 3 and Example 4 a pyridine ring and piperazine ring respectively . However substitution at the same position with a tertiary alkylamine unexpectedly resulted in a 10 fold increase in solubility.

The foregoing is meant to illustrate the invention but not to limit it. Variations and changes obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope of the invention as defined in the claims.
