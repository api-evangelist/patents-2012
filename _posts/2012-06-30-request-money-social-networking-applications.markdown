This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 935 139 filed Nov. 5 2007 entitled REQUEST MONEY SOCIAL NETWORKING APPLICATIONS which application is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.

The present application relates generally to the technical field of e commerce and in one specific example the transfer of funds via social networks.

Social networking sites allow persons to communicate in relative anonymity by using certain network handles. These network handles may be a name associated with a user and in some cases this name may appear as associated with a widget appearing on the home page of a user of the social networking site. By using these networking handles and associated widgets users of the social networking site may be able to exchange messages and other types of information.

Example methods and systems to request a transfer of funds from a user of a social networking site are disclosed herein. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

In some example embodiments a system and method is shown that allows users of a social networking site to request funds from other users of the social networking site. Social networking sites are web sites that allow communities of people who share interests and activities or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others to communicate. Some well known social networking sites or communities include FACEBOOK of book Corporation of Palo Alto Calif. and MYSPACE of MySpace Corporation of Beverly Hills Calif. An aspect of these social networking sites is providing to a user e.g. a member of a social networking site a customizable social networking site home page that the user can customize based upon their own needs and desires. In some example cases a Hyper Text Markup Language HTML editor is provided to the user to allow them to edit the text that may appear on their social networking site home page. In some example embodiments a user of a social networking application may be an account holder such as a requestor of funds or grantor of funds. Further in some example cases a social networking application provides various open Application Programming Interfaces API that allow users to write applications that can interface with the social networking application to provide additional functionality for their social networking site home page. This additional functionality may be in the form of additional services provided to the users of the social networking site home page. In some example cases these applications are known as widgets.

Some example embodiments may include a user of a social networking site as being a person e.g. a legal person such as a corporation or a natural person who has at least one account with the social networking site. Account is a mechanism that allows the user to utilize the resources of the social networking site. Resources may include the ability to request and authorize the transfer of funds.

Some example embodiments may include the use of a widget to provide various services to a user of a social networking site home page. For example in one embodiment a widget in the form of a request money application is used to generate a request for funds and transmit this request for funds to a social networking application which in turn forwards the request to a second user of the social networking application. If approved by this second user the social networking application may interface with a payment processor application to transfer the requested funds from an account held by the second user to an account held by the user requesting the funds. In other example embodiments it is the request money application itself that interfaces with the payment processor application to facilitate the transfer of funds. Some well known payment processor applications are those designed and implemented by PAYPAL . In some example embodiments this request money application may be provided by the payment processor as a service that can be downloaded to and implemented on the social networking site home page. In some example embodiments this request money application e.g. a funds request application may be written using Dynamic HTML DHTML or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX technology. Further in some example embodiments FLASH technology may be used.

In some example embodiments this Internet application may be executed and run on for example a cell phone a computer system a television a Personal Digital Assistant PDA or some other suitable device. Collectively these various devices may be referenced herein as devices . Some example embodiments may include the requestor of funds generating the funds request and network handle message e.g. a funds request that may be transmitted across a network to for example a social networking application server . In some example embodiments a plurality of social networking application servers may be implemented such that this plurality of social networking application servers may belong to the same social networking site and serve the same social networking community. This social networking application server may be operatively coupled to an account database . In some example embodiments this social networking application server may also be operatively coupled to a web server or plurality of web servers and a database server or a plurality of database servers.

In some example embodiments a funds request application may be utilized to generate the funds request and networking handle message . This funds request application may be written using certain programming principles and technology associated with DHTML AJAX or some other suitable programming principles and technology. In one example embodiment a requestor of funds selects a widget as it may appear in the interact application . Once selected the network handle e.g. an identifier to uniquely identify the requestor of funds associated with the widget and an amount of funds being requested is encoded into an eXtensible Markup Language XML format and wrapped in an additional layer of encoding such as the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocols TCP IP . After the wrapping in the additional layer of encoding occurs the network handle and amount of funds is sent as a funds request and networking handle message .

Once this funds request and networking handle message is received by the social networking application server a funds request is sent across the network to for example a grantor of funds . In some example embodiments the grantor of funds may be a member of a social networking community. The grantor of funds may be identified by their network handle or an email address. In still other example embodiments a grantor of funds is automatically identified by their email address at the time a payment is made in response to the funds request irrespective of whether the grantor or funds has an account with a payment processor application server . Further this grantor of funds may utilize an Internet application that may include a web browser an instant messaging application or some other suitable application that may be used to display a social networking site. As with the Internet application the Internet application may be executed on for example a cell phone a computer system a television a PDA or some other suitable device. In some example embodiments the grantor of funds may generate and send a funds authorization data packet utilizing the Internet application . This funds authorization data packet may be sent across the network to the social networking application server . Once this funds authorization data packet is received by the social networking application server a funds transfer instruction with email IDs may be sent across the network to for example the payment processor application server . In some example embodiments the internee applications and may provide a Graphical User Interface GUI to allow the requestor of funds to generate a funds request and network handle and to allow the grantor of funds to generate a funds authorization data packet . A selection device such as a mouse light pen keyboard or other suitable selection device may be used in conjunction with the GUI.

In some example cases the funds authorization data packet e.g. funds authorization may be hashed symmetrically encrypted asymmetrically encrypted or some combination or permutation of these processes performed so as to both prove the identity of the grantor of funds and to obscure the amount funds being authorized. That is the funds authorization data packet may contain an identifier to uniquely identify the grantor of funds and an amount. With regard to proving the identity of the grantor of funds the grantor of funds may provide a private key or may uniquely hash an identity value e.g. their own network handle so as provide a digital signature to be used to prove their identity. As to obscuring the amount of funds being authorized a hash algorithm and or symmetric or asymmetric algorithm may be implemented to obscure the amount of funds. Some well known hashing algorithms include Message Digest 5 MD 5 Secure Hash Algorithm SHA 1 while some well known symmetric algorithms include Twofish Serpent Advanced Encryption Standard AES Blowfish Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares 5 CAST5 Rivest Cipher 4 RC4 Triple Data Encryption Standard TDES and International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA . Some well know asymmetric algorithms include Rivest Shamir Adleman RSA Diffie Hellman and Digital Signature Standard DSS .

In some example embodiments the funds request and network handle funds transfer verification funds authorization funds request and funds transfer instruction with email IDs may be formatted This formatting may include for example the use of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS . Secure Sockets Layer SSL Secure Shell SSH and other suitable protocols to obscure the selection input. The HTTPS SSL SSH and other suitable protocols may be used in conjunction with TCP IP such that a session may be established between for example the one or more devices and the social networking application server s .

Some example embodiments may include the requestor of funds and the grantor of funds being members of the same or different social networking community. For example in some example embodiments the grantor of funds may be able to authorize funds to be sent from a first social networking community to a second social networking community. More to the point in some example embodiments the social networking application servers used by one social networking site may be used to send the funds authorization to another social networking application server operated by a different social networking site.

In some example cases a second transmitter is shown to transmit a funds authorization message. In some example embodiments a second generator is shown to generate a funds transfer instruction based in part upon the funds authorization message. Also a third transmitter may be implemented to transmit the funds transfer instruction based upon the funds authorization message to a payment processor. A determination engine may be implemented to determine whether a requestor of funds has an account with the payment processor based in part upon the funds authorization message. Also this determination engine may be implemented to determine whether the grantor of funds has an account with the payment processor based in part upon the funds authorization message. A prompt engine may be implemented to prompt a user to set up an account with the payment processor based in part upon the funds authorization message the user including at least one of the grantor of funds and the requestor of funds. Moreover in some example embodiments a third transmitter may be implemented to transmit a funds transfer instruction based upon the funds authorization message using at least one of a social networking application and a widget application.

Some example embodiments may include the various databases including relational databases e.g. account database or in some example cases On Line Analytical Processing OLAP based databases. In the case of relational databases various tables of data are created and data is inserted into and or selected from these tables using a Structured Query Language SQL or some other database query language known in the art. In the case of OLAP databases one or more multi dimensional cubes or hypercubes containing multidimensional data from which data is selected from or inserted into using a Multi Dimensional Expression MDX language may be implemented. In the case of a database using tables and SQL a database application such as for example MYSQL SQLSERVER Oracle 81 10G or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data In the case of a database using cubes and MDX a database using Multidimensional On Line Analytic Processing MOLAP Relational On Line Analytic Processing ROLAP Hybrid On Line Analytic Processing HOLAP or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data. These tables or cubes made up of tables in the case of for example ROLAP are organized into a RDS or Object Relational Data Schema ORDS as is known in the art. These schemas may be normalized using certain normalization algorithms so as to avoid abnormalities such as non additive joins and other problems. Additionally these normalization algorithms may include Boyce Codd Normal Form or some other normalization optimization algorithm known in the art.

In some example embodiments a table is shown containing information or data relating to field requests. Contained within this table may be information relating to who has responded to the request for funds e.g. the grantor of funds an amount with the purpose for what the provided money is an update that the funds were provided and the status of the providing of the funds. Various data types may be used in this table including for example a string data type to denote who the requested funds have been received from a currency integer or float data type used to denote the amount of the funds a string data type for the fields denoting the purpose of the funds a date data type for the date the funds were received and a string data type for the status of the funds once received. Further illustrated is a table that contains a list of network handles from whom requests for funds may be made or to whom requests for funds may be directed. Contained in this table is any one of a number of network handles that may uniquely identify a particular individual that may be a part of the social networking site or who more specifically may have an account residing on the social networking application server . A string integer or some other suitable data type may be used to store these network handles. Further a table is shown containing various accounts settings. These account settings may relate to particular pre defined settings for a particular user s social networking homepage. One or more Boolean data types may be used to stores these settings. A further table is shown containing user account information. This table may contain user account information which may be in the form of for example contact information allowing one to contact a particular party having an account on the social networking application server . This user account information may be for example a particular person e.g. the requestor of funds the grantor of funds their physical address their telephone number their email address and other suitable information. String data types may be used to store this information. The table is used to contain unique identifier information to uniquely identify each of the pieces of data contained in each of the tables through . This unique identifier information may be some type of unique integer value serving as for example a foreign key in each of the tables through .

In some example embodiments a method is illustrated as implemented in a distributed or non distributed software application designed under a three tier architecture paradigm whereby the various components of computer code that implement this method may be categorized as belonging to one or more of these three tiers. Some example embodiments may include a first tier as an interface e.g. an interface tier that is relatively free of application processing. Further a second tier may be a logic tier that performs application processing in the form of logical mathematical manipulations of data inputted through the interface level and communicates the results of these logical mathematical manipulations to the interface tier and or to a backend or storage tier. These logical mathematical manipulations may relate to certain business rules or processes that govern the software application as a whole. A third storage tier may be a persistent storage medium or non persistent storage medium. In some example cases one or more of these tiers may be collapsed into another resulting in a two tier architecture or even a one tier architecture. For example the interface and logic tiers may be consolidated or the logic and storage tiers may be consolidated as in the case of a software application with an embedded database. This three tier architecture may be implemented using one technology or as will be discussed below a variety of technologies. This three tier architecture and the technologies through which it is implemented may be executed on two or more computer systems organized in a server client peer to peer or so some other suitable configuration. Further these three tiers may be distributed between more than one computer systems as various software components.

Some example embodiments may include the above illustrated tiers and processes or operations that make them up as being written as one or more software components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate use and manipulate data. These components and the functionality associated with each may be used by client server or peer computer systems. These various components may be implemented by a computer system on an as needed basis. These components may be written in an object oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library VCL Component Library for Cross Platform CLX Java Beans JB Java Enterprise Beans EJB Component Object Model COM Distributed Component Object Model DCOM or other suitable technique. These components may be linked to other components via various APIs and then compiled into one complete server client and or peer software application. Further these APIs may be able to communicate through various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.

Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above illustrated components across a distributed programming environment as distributed computing components. For example an interface component e.g. an interface tier may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing a logic component e.g. a logic tier . These first and second computer systems may be configured in a server client peer to peer or some other suitable configuration. These various components may be written using the above illustrated object oriented programming techniques and can be written in the same programming language or a different programming language. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example a component written in C may be able to communicate with another component written in the Java programming language through utilizing a distributed computing protocol such as a Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA a Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP or some other suitable protocol. Some example embodiments may include the use of one or more of these protocols with the various protocols outlined in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI model or Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data.

Some example embodiments may utilize the OSI basic reference model or TCP IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models a system of data transmission between a server and client or between peer computer systems is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising an application layer a transport layer a network layer a data link layer and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three tier architecture the various tiers e.g. the interface logic and storage tiers reside on the application layer of the TCP IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP IP protocol stack model data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also contains port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer and the data transmitted over a network such as an Internet Local Area Network LAN Wide Area Network WAN or some other suitable network. In some example cases Internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data including the aforementioned TCP IP and additionally ATM SNA SDI or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies e.g. a star topology or structures.

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a Central Processing Unit CPU a Graphics Processing Unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a Liquid Crystal Display LCD or a Cathode Ray Tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a User Interface UI cursor controller e.g. a mouse a disc drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device e.g. a transmitter .

The disc drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions illustrated herein. The software may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device utilizing any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTP Session Initiation Protocol SIP .

In some example embodiments a removable physical storage medium is shown to be a single medium and the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that causes the machine to perform any of the one or more methodologies illustrated herein. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories optical and magnetic medium and carrier wave signals.

In some example embodiments a system and method is illustrated that allows users of social networking sites to utilize a downloadable widget in the form of a money request application to make funds requests of other users of the social networking site. Some example embodiments may include users of a social networking site generating a funds request while still maintaining the anonymity provided by the use of network handles in lieu of actual email addresses. Further grantors of funds may similarly maintain their anonymity in the granting of the requested funds. For example a user of the social networking site generating a funds request for their favorite charity can be done without having to divulge their identity through the use of for example an email address. Moreover this anonymity is further preserved through the use of a payment processor to facilitate the actual transfer of funds between the requestor of funds and the grantor of funds. Specifically while the payment processor may know the email address of the requestor of funds and the grantor of funds the requestors and grantors may not know this information.
