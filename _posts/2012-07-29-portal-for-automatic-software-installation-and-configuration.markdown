All of the material in this patent document including computer program listing that may be included in an Appendix if any is subject to copyright protection under the copyright laws of the United States and other countries. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in official governmental records but otherwise all other copyright rights whatsoever are reserved.

The invention relates generally to a portal for on line management of a software implementation project and more particularly to a portal established between a software installer and a client to facilitate set up configuration maintenance and support of software.

Software is often developed and customized for use in a specific corporate environment. Since many firms do not have the resources to generate their own customized software such companies outsource software development. At the initial stage of development skilled experts interview a client to identify their needs and determine how to develop the product based on the identified needs.

After the software is developed in accordance with the client s specifications the developer may provide additional services to implement and configure the software. The software company may identify and order any hardware that is necessary to provide client side support of the software e.g. a customized server . A representative of the software firm e.g. a field engineer or implementation consultant may be required to visit the client s physical site to install the software and configure any additional hardware required to support the software. The field engineer may also need to test the system and provide training before the software can be used for its intended purposes. As a result the field engineer may be required to return to the client s physical site numerous times before the software system is operating properly.

The conventional process of implementing and configuring software is both time and cost inefficient. Software implementation may be delayed by any number of reasons due to the nature of any customized process. Such reasons may include miscommunication between different software company representatives and the client wrongly configured hardware changed specifications after development has been initiated or client employees unable to attend scheduled training sessions. In addition costs may be increased due to the large number of experts that are required to complete the development installation testing and training processes. Accordingly what is needed is an improved method for implementing customized software that reduces costs and that shortens the time required to implement configure and support a complete software product.

The invention generally establishes a portal between a software installer and a client to provide on line management of a software implementation project. The portal may be used to facilitate project and installation scheduling as well as configuration distribution maintenance and support of the software. The installer and the client may communicate through the portal beginning at the earliest implementation stages to establish details of an implementation contract including assigning a project manager at the software company and identifying specifications required by the client.

The client may be provided with a set up wizard through the portal. The set up wizard prompts the client for information such that the software system may be configured based on logic generated in response to client input. Data may be migrated through the portal from the client to be stored in and accessed from memory at the installer side of the portal. The migrated data may also be converted to a format that is compatible with the reconfigured software. Communication links may be established between the client and third party entities e.g. insurance providers pharmacies via the portal. Client side users may be trained to interact with the software via tutorials that may be accessed at any time from the installer through the portal.

The installer may have a variety of different standardized software components that are used in any platform regardless of the particular software configuration. Examples of such software components may include application programming interfaces conversion modules work flows tools peripherals plug ins and the like. Accordingly a significant portion of the software system may be preconfigured for any specific application. In many cases only some of the software components require modification based on the client s specifications before being incorporated into the configured software product. Since many of the software components may be used in the same software the automation of repetitive product set up is facilitated.

In accordance with embodiments of the invention a computer implemented method may configure software by exchanging data through a web portal established between a software installer and a client. A set up wizard is provided from the installer to the client through the portal. The set up wizard prompts a user at the client to input data regarding software to be configured for the client. The input data is received at the set up wizard via the portal. At least some of the accessed software components are modified based on the received input data to generate the software configuration.

In one feature the method includes migrating data from the client through the portal for storage in memory at a location external to the client. The migrated data may be accessible by the installer and the client.

In another feature the method includes providing the configured software from the installer to the client via the portal.

In yet another feature the method includes providing a tutorial from the installer to the client via the portal. User input is received via the portal while executing the tutorial at the client.

In still another feature the method includes providing a link from the client to a third party entity via the portal.

In still yet another feature a portion of the accessed software components is preconfigured such that modification of the portion of the accessed software components is not necessary to generate the configured software.

Further illustrations of the process flows and the descriptions thereof may make reference to user windows web pages websites web forms prompts etc.

The client may represent any entity that requires customizable software while the installer may represent a software development entity that has been hired by the client to configure and install the software. For purposes of explanation alone the client may be a health care facility such as a hospital an out patient health care clinic or a doctor s office and the installer may be an organization that develops software for the healthcare industry. However as one having ordinary skill in the art of computing would appreciate the invention is not so limited.

The client initiates the software implementation process by informing the installer that the client requires implementation of customizable software for its organization. After agreeing on the basic terms for providing the software including the appointment of a project manager the installer establishes a portal directly to the client . The portal may be defined as a web site that may provide links to information provided by the installer . A project manager appointed to the implementation project may act as a main point of contact between the client and the installer.

The portal is established to provide access control and procedures for multiple applications that when executed cause data to be transferred between the installer and the client . Specifically the portal allows both the installer and the client to manage the software implementation project. The portal provides the client and the installer with information regarding the status of every project task performed or scheduled to be performed. For example the portal may be used to facilitate project scheduling as well as configuration distribution implementation support and maintenance of the software as discussed in detail below .

Once the portal is established the installer and the client may use the portal to negotiate the terms of a contract. The client may set forth the specifications required for the software product. Other terms may be established using the portal such as those related to budgeting projected implementation date status updates testing procedures and training plans.

The client may require a software product that provides a unique set of functionality. The unique aspects may be based on the application for which the software is being configured the hardware used by the client the operating system platform operated by the hardware and the amount of available memory to name a few. Conventionally a representative of the software company would be required to assess the client s intended use of the software and to identify different aspects of the client s computing environment such that the software would provide the desired results while also being compatible with the client s computing environment.

In order to reduce the amount of manpower required to implement the software a set up wizard may be provided to the client through the portal . The set up wizard prompts the client for information regarding the application specifications required by the client and information related to the client s existing computing system. Example questions proposed to the client by the set up wizard may include the following Do you want a laboratory interface established Do you want to make templates available from the new software 

The client provides set up responses to the questions proposed by the set up wizard . The set up responses may be provided to the installer as logic input such that the software system may be configured and installed based on the logic generated in response to client input.

The installer requirements for implementing identifies the client s the software different system in response to receiving the set up responses . Some of the requirements may need to be implemented by generating software code specifically for the client . Other requirements may be fulfilled by accessing any of a variety of prefabricated standardized software components that may be used in many different platforms regardless of the particular software configuration e.g. work flows tools application programming interfaces conversion modules peripherals etc. Some of the preconfigured software components may require modification based on the client s set up responses to provide a software product that operates within the client s established specifications. Accordingly since a significant portion of the software system may be preconfigured for any specific application some of the steps in implementing the customizable software product may be automated.

The set up wizard may also be used to establish communication links between the client and third party entities via the portal . The third party entity may be an insurance provider a laboratory a pharmacy a healthcare specialist a government agency a data storage facility or any other entity that may require data that is transmitted through the portal between the client and the installer .

As stated above the set up wizard is controlled by the installer for eliciting information from the client . When the set up wizard requires updating or correction only the version of the set wizard that is stored at the installer need be modified before being distributed to the client . This feature is advantageous because each individual client does not require a specific update to the set up wizard thereby reducing the amount of client installer interaction.

After the initial configuration of the software system is established based on the set up wizard the installer may forward a data migration wizard to the client . The client may interact with the data migration wizard to establish parameters for having data automatically entered into the software system such that the data is available for access by the newly configured software. The data to be migrated may include existing patient records including personal information medical history prescriptions previously observed symptoms laboratory results etc. Other data that may be migrated includes billing information such as the codes used to identify different medical procedures. In response to client input to the data migration wizard the data may be retrieved from client memory and stored in memory at the installer . In some embodiments the migrated data or a portion of the migrated data may be stored at a third party that is also connected to the portal . If necessary the installer or the third party may convert the migrated data into a format that is compatible with the newly configured software system.

The installer may further configure the software system in accordance with the client s specifications. This process may include retrieving the software components that are required for the software product and modifying some of the software components based on the set up responses . The installer may also develop new software components by writing additional code to include components that were not preconfigured and to support the software product in the client s computing environment. Additional required hardware may also be ordered and installed at the client to support the software system.

When an initial configuration of the software product is completed the software product may be delivered from the installer to the client via the portal . If all of the required hardware is installed at the client the installer may be able to complete the installation process through the portal without being physically present at the client s site. A testing process may then be executed by exchanging testing data between the installer and the client to insure that the software is operating in accordance with the client s specifications. The testing process may also check whether the migrated data stored at the installer or the third party is accessible to the client via the portal .

Once the completed software product is installed at the client and the data is accessible to operate the system training tutorials may be provided at any time to educate users at the client . A user who requires training may submit a request to the installer through the portal to access the training tutorial . In response the installer provides the training tutorial to the client . As the user interacts with the training tutorial at the client tutorial data is generated and may be forwarded to the installer through the portal .

After the client hires the installer to implement a customizable software system a portal is established between the installer and the client step . The portal may be established as a web site that is accessible only to the client such that the client can communicate directly with the installer to facilitate management of the software configuration process. A project manager may be appointed to handle all incoming communications from the client to manage scheduling of configuration distribution implementation support and maintenance of the software. The portal allows both the installer and the client to assess the status of any specific task of the software implementation process.

The portal is used to provide a set up wizard to the client step . The set up wizard provides a series of prompts to the user to identify specific client needs regarding specifications of the software product to be implemented. The prompts may also illicit information from the user to identify the capabilities of the existing hardware system used by the client that is intended to support the software product. The set up wizard may also be used to establish specific contract terms regarding the configuration of the software.

The client receives the responses to the set up wizard prompts from the user step . The user may enter the information by any known data input technique. In some cases some responses to the prompts may be determined by scanning the hardware or memory on the client side such that a user is not required to physically enter any data in response to the prompt.

As data is collected in reply to the prompts from the set up wizard the collected data is provided from the client to the installer via the portal step . The installer may provide additional prompts at any time during the implementation process in order to illicit any additional information that may be necessary to continue configuring the software.

The data received from the client in response to the prompts from the set up wizard may identify that the client desires a communication link between the client and a third party entity. Accordingly the installer includes the communication link from the client to a third party entity via the portal step . The communication link allows the client to communicate directly with a desired third party entity without having to circumvent the portal established between the client and the installer. Examples of such third party entities may include a laboratory a specialist a general practitioner a hospital a pharmacy an insurance provider or a data storage facility.

The installer may provide a data migration wizard to the client via the portal step . The data migration wizard prompts the client to prompt the client to determine if the client approves the transfer of existing data to the installer or a third party and to identify which data is to be migrated. Data migration from client memory to the installer or a third party data storage facility would prevent the need to re enter existing data for access by the implemented software product. Also the data would be readily accessible from and managed by the installer or third party thereby easing the burden of data management at the client.

In response to client input to the data migration wizard the existing data may be migrated from the client to the installer or third party via the portal step . The data that is migrated may include any data stored at the client that may be required to be accessed by the implemented software product e.g. patient records medical history insurance information billing and accounting information etc. The data may be retrieved from memory at the client side and transferred to memory at the installer or third party via the portal.

The migrated data may not be in a format that is compatible with the re configured software system. Accordingly the migrated data may be converted to a format that is compatible with the software product configured by the installer step .

Once the software system is configured in accordance with client specifications and the data is accessible in a suitable format the software product is distributed to the client via the portal step . The installer may also provide software installation instructions to the client through the portal.

After the software is installed the installer may test the software via the portal by initiating a data exchange between the installer and the client step . In response to test results the installer may modify the software to overcome any errors. The modifications may be provided to the client via the portal.

A new user at the client may request installer support or training to become familiar with the newly configured system. In response the client submits the requested support information or a tutorial via the portal for access by the new user step . As the new user interacts with the support information tutorial data is exchanged between the client and the installer via the portal step .

As described above a portal is provided between a client and a software installer to facilitate a software configuration process. The portal improves information exchange between the client and the installer. The client may access a wizard and other tools via the portal to configure and implement a software system. The portal allows many repeatable steps in the configuration and installation processes to be automated because many software products include many of the same components.

Although the present invention is described with respect to software configuration in the healthcare field the invention is not so limited. That is it is contemplated that the invention may be used with any software that is implemented for any type of use in any field.
