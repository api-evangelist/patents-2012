The passages are provided on the shaft and the rotor core which are rotators and form rotator side cooling medium passages through which the cooling medium passes.

On one end portion side of the shaft more specifically on the side circumferential portion on the end portion side on the second flange side a resolver is mounted as a rotation angle detection sensor that detects the rotation angle of the shaft . The axial passage is opened on the end portion on the second flange side. Namely the resolver is mounted on the side circumferential portion of the shaft on the end portion side where the axial passage is opened.

The flange projection of the second flange includes an intra projection space . The intra projection space is provided with a cooling medium introduction member as a presser member. The cooling medium introduction member has a function of supplying the cooling medium from a cooling medium supply unit included in the cover which is a rest system to the shaft which is a rotating system and a function of pressing and fixing the resolver as a rotation angle detection sensor to the flange projection provided on the second flange . The cooling medium introduction member includes a cooling medium introduction passage penetrating through the inside of the cooling medium introduction member . The cooling medium introduction passage faces the opening of the axial passage of the shaft that is the cooling medium introduction passage faces the inlet I and introduces the cooling medium into the axial passage . Moreover the flange projection includes a bearing side passage that supplies the cooling medium to the bearing B. The bearing B is supplied with the cooling medium from the bearing side passage . Furthermore the flange projection is mounted with a connector that holds a cable to lead out the output of the resolver .

The cover is mounted on the opening of the flange projection and blocks the intra projection space included in the flange projection . In addition the cover includes the cooling medium supply unit . More specifically the cooling medium supply unit is provided on the inside of the cover configuring the housing . Since the cover is disposed on the upper part on the opposite side of the vertical direction the cooling medium supply unit is also disposed on the upper part. The cooling medium supply unit includes a bearing passage and a rotor passage described later. The cooling medium supply unit introduces the cooling medium from the cooling medium inlet mounted on the cover which is a rest system and supplies the cooling medium to the intra shaft cooling medium passage included in the shaft which is a rotating system through the rotor passage . As described above the cooling medium supply unit supplies the cooling medium from the rest system to the rotating system. Moreover the cooling medium supply unit also supplies the cooling medium introduced from the cooling medium inlet to the bearing side passage included in the flange projection through the bearing passage . The cooling medium supplied to the bearing side passage is supplied to the bearing B.

As illustrated in the cover mounted on the flange projection includes a first cooling medium distribution passage a second cooling medium distribution passage a third cooling medium distribution passage and a fourth cooling medium distribution passage that distribute the cooling medium from the cooling medium inlet . Moreover the cover includes a filter storage portion that stores a filter a relief passage and a relief valve . The cooling medium inlet is connected to the filter storage portion through the first cooling medium distribution passage .

The second cooling medium distribution passage is connected to the filter storage portion and introduces a part of the cooling medium passing through the filter into a cooling medium reservoir of the cooling medium introduction member . The cooling medium introduction passage is connected to the cooling medium reservoir . The cooling medium introduction passage introduces the cooling medium in the cooling medium reservoir into the axial passage included in the shaft . The cooling medium introduction passage is a passage having a restriction section disposed between the cooling medium reservoir and the axial passage which is a part of the internal cooling medium passage.

The motor is disposed or mounted on a mounting object in such a way that the rotational center axis Zr is in parallel with the gravitational direction the direction indicated by arrow G in . In the embodiment the cooling medium reservoir is positioned on the upper part when the motor is disposed or mounted. With this configuration the cooling medium supplied from the cooling medium supply unit included in the cover to the cooling medium reservoir flows down due to the action of gravity and flows from the cooling medium introduction passage into the axial passage .

The second cooling medium distribution passage the cooling medium reservoir and the cooling medium introduction passage correspond to the rotor passage . The third cooling medium distribution passage is connected to the filter storage portion and introduces the rest of the cooling medium which passes through the filter and is introduced into the cooling medium introduction passage into the fourth cooling medium distribution passage .

The relief passage connects the cooling medium inlet to the relief valve . The relief valve is disposed between the relief passage the second cooling medium distribution passage and the third cooling medium distribution passage so as to bypass the filter . When the pressure of the cooling medium in the relief passage exceeds the valve opening pressure of the relief valve the relief valve is opened and the cooling medium from the cooling medium inlet flows into the second cooling medium distribution passage and the third cooling medium distribution passage as the cooling medium bypasses the filter . The valve opening pressure of the relief valve can be set to the pressure in the relief passage at which the filter is clogged and replacement is needed for example. With this configuration even though the filter is clogged and replacement is needed the cooling medium can be reliably supplied to the bearing B and the rotor core for example. Moreover the valve opening pressure of the relief valve is thus set and a unit to notify that the relief valve is opened is prepared so that the replacement time of the filter can be notified because the relief valve is opened.

In the embodiment in a plurality of the cooling medium passages included in the cover the passages orthogonal to the rotational center axis Zr of the motor are disposed on the same flat plane. In this case the center axes of the passages are disposed on the same flat plane. More specifically the center axes of the first cooling medium distribution passage the filter storage portion the third cooling medium distribution passage the relief passage the passage connecting the relief valve to the relief passage the passage connecting the filter storage portion to the first cooling medium distribution passage and the cooling medium inlet and so on illustrated in are disposed on the same flat plane.

The passages in the cover orthogonal to the rotational center axis Zr of the motor are bored through the cover in the horizontal direction for example. The disposition of the passages as described above facilitates the selection of efficient steps and allows efficient processing in processing the passages on the cover . Namely in the case where a plurality of the passages orthogonal to the rotational center axis Zr of the motor is formed in the cover the height from the reference plane to tools is made constant and the passages can be bored at a plurality of locations on the cover in the horizontal direction so that the occasions in which the height of the tools is changed can be made at the minimum. As a result it is possible to reduce working periods and time and effort to set tools in forming a plurality of the passages orthogonal to the rotational center axis Zr of the motor on the cover so that productivity can be improved and manufacturing costs can be reduced.

The flange projection that is the bearing passage is provided on the rest system and the supply of the cooling medium is not affected by the rotation of the rotor core . Thus as compared with the case where oil passages are formed on the bearing B from the shaft side variations in the cooling medium in association with the rotation of the rotor core can be suppressed. As a result an appropriate amount of the cooling medium can be supplied to the bearing B. Next the cooling system of the motor will be described.

In the case of cooling the motor the pump motor drives the pump . The pump then sucks the cooling medium CL from the discharge passage and discharges the cooling medium CL to the passage . Foreign substances for example are removed from the cooling medium CL in the process in which the cooling medium CL passes through the filter and the cooling medium CL flows into the bearing passage and the rotor passage . The cooling medium CL flowing into the bearing passage cools and lubricates the bearing B and then the cooling medium CL is collected into the oil reservoir portion . The cooling medium CL flowing into the rotor passage cools the rotor core and the coil of the motor and then the cooling medium CL is collected into the oil reservoir portion . The oil reservoir portion is connected to the suction port of the pump with the discharge passage in the midway point of which the filter is provided. The cooling medium CL collected into the oil reservoir portion passes through the discharge passage and foreign substances are removed from the cooling medium CL through the filter . The cooling medium CL is again sucked into the pump and discharged to the passage .

The passage is connected to the discharge port of the pump and branched to the inlet side of the filter and the relief passage in the motor . The passage provided on the outlet side of the filter to pass the cooling medium is branched to the bearing passage and the rotor passage . The bearing passage supplies the cooling medium to the bearing B for cooling and lubricating the bearing B. The rotor passage supplies the cooling medium to the rotor of the motor for cooling and lubricating the rotor. It is noted that the cooling system does not necessarily include the bearing passage . The relief passage branched from the passage connected to the discharge port of the pump is connected to the inlet of the relief valve . The outlet side of the relief valve is connected to the outlet side of the filter . Next the flow of the cooling medium in cooling the motor will be described.

A part of the cooling medium that is supplied from the cooling medium inlet of the cover and passes through the filter flows into the cooling medium reservoir of the rotor passage . The cooling medium is stored in the cooling medium reservoir and then flows into the axial passage of the intra shaft cooling medium passage through the cooling medium introduction passage . The cooling medium passes through the radial passages and then flows into the rotor core through hole through the recess of the balance plate . The cooling medium cools the rotor core and the permanent magnets not illustrated in the process in which the cooling medium passes through the rotor core through hole and then flows out of the balance plate through hole of the balance plate . In the case where the rotor core is rotating the cooling medium flowing out of the balance plate through hole is supplied to the coil end of the stator to the portion at which the coil protrudes from the stator core due to centrifugal force. The cooling medium cools the stator in the process in which the cooling medium flows down in the inside of the housing and the cooling medium is collected to a first outlet port provided on the inner side of the first flange of the housing . The reference sign OL in indicates the liquid level of the cooling medium stored in the oil reservoir portion . As described above for the amount of the cooling medium stored in the oil reservoir portion the discharge amount from the cooling medium outlet port is adjusted in such a way that a part of the coil end protruding toward the first flange side always remains in the cooling medium as illustrated in and the cooling medium cools the coil end.

In the cooling medium that is supplied from the cooling medium inlet of the cover and passes through the filter the cooling medium that does not flow into the rotor passage flows into the bearing passage and is supplied to the bearing B. The cooling medium cools and lubricates the bearing B and flows down in the inside of the housing . In the process in which the cooling medium flows down in the inside of the housing the cooling medium that contacts the rotor core is supplied to the stator on the outer side of the rotor core in the radial direction due to centrifugal force and the cooling medium cools the stator . The cooling medium that cools the stator flows down in the inside of the housing and the cooling medium is collected into the oil reservoir portion provided on the inner side of the first flange of the housing .

The cooling medium collected into the oil reservoir portion mainly flows into the discharge passage through the first outlet port . The cooling medium is guided to the filter for removal of foreign substances for example and is discharged from the cooling medium outlet port included in the first flange . The cooling medium in the oil reservoir portion that does not pass through the first outlet port flows into a bearing outer space through the space between the inner ring outer ring and rolling element of the bearing A and then passes through a second outlet port . As a result a part of the cooling medium collected into the oil reservoir portion cools and lubricates the bearing A. The cooling medium passing through the second outlet port flows into the discharge passage and the cooling medium is guided to the filter for the removal of foreign substances for example and discharged from the cooling medium outlet port included in the first flange .

As described above the cooling medium cools the rotor core and the stator as well as cools and lubricates the bearings A and B. In addition to this as described above cooling water is supplied from the cooling water inlet port to the water jacket included in the housing shell of the housing . This cooling water mainly cools the stator through the housing . A gasket is disposed between the first flange and the housing shell as a sealing member that seals the water jacket . The gasket also has the function as an oil seal that avoids an event that the cooling medium in the inside of the housing flows out between the housing shell and the first flange and is included in the water jacket or that the cooling medium flows out of the housing . Next the cooling medium reservoir and the cooling medium introduction passage as a passage will be described in more detail.

The cooling medium introduction member is provided with the cooling medium reservoir on the cooling medium inlet side on the second cooling medium distribution passage side connected to the cooling medium inlet in this example and the cooling medium introduction passage penetrates from the cooling medium reservoir toward the inlet I. The direction in which the cooling medium introduction passage penetrates through the cooling medium introduction member is the direction in parallel with the rotational center axis Zr of the shaft . The cooling medium reservoir is disposed on the inside of the housing together with the cooling medium introduction member .

The cooling medium introduction member is a member in a nearly cylindrical shape. In the embodiment the cooling medium introduction member also serves as a resolver presser that presses the resolver . This point will be described later. The cooling medium reservoir is a cone shaped recess provided on one end portion of the cooling medium introduction member that is provided on the end portion opposite to the opening of the second cooling medium distribution passage provided on the cover . The cooling medium reservoir is opposite to the second cooling medium distribution passage . The cooling medium flowing into the cooling medium inlet and flowing out of the second cooling medium distribution passage is temporarily stored in the cooling medium reservoir .

The cooling medium reservoir includes an opening I of the cooling medium introduction passage on the bottom that is on the other end portion side of the cooling medium introduction member . The cooling medium introduction passage penetrates through the cooling medium introduction member from the bottom of the cooling medium reservoir toward the other end portion. An opening E of the cooling medium introduction passage opened on the other end portion of the cooling medium introduction member is opposite to the inlet I of the axial passage . The cooling medium temporarily stored in the cooling medium reservoir flows from the opening I into the cooling medium introduction passage flows out of the opening E and flows from the inlet I of the axial passage into the axial passage . As described above the cooling medium reservoir is provided on the inside of the housing and on the upstream side of the inlet I of the axial passage in the flowing direction of the cooling medium in the direction indicated by arrow C and the cooling medium reservoir stores the cooling medium and then flows the cooling medium to the axial passage .

since an O ring is disposed between a recess U of the cover and the cooling medium introduction member the leakage of the cooling medium between the recess U of the cover and the cooling medium introduction member is suppressed. Moreover since an oil seal is disposed between the cooling medium introduction member and the shaft the leakage of the cooling medium between the cooling medium introduction member and the shaft is suppressed. With this structure the cooling medium supplied from the second cooling medium distribution passage is supplied to the axial passage of the shaft through the cooling medium reservoir of the cooling medium introduction member and the cooling medium introduction passage . The cooling medium introduction member is provided on the rest system and the shaft is provided on the rotating system so that the cooling medium is supplied from the rest system to the rotating system.

The cooling medium introduction passage includes a restriction section D between the cooling medium reservoir and the axial passage . The restriction section D is a portion at which the cross sectional area of the cooling medium introduction passage is the smallest between the opening I and the opening E. The cross sectional area described above is the area of the cross section orthogonal to the direction in which the cooling medium introduction passage penetrates through the cooling medium introduction member and is appropriately referred to as a passage cross sectional area. The restriction section D adjusts the flow rate of the cooling medium stored in the cooling medium reservoir to flow out of the opening E of the cooling medium introduction passage . The restriction section D is provided between the cooling medium reservoir and the axial passage and the cooling medium reservoir can always hold an appropriate amount of the cooling medium during the operation of the motor so that the motor can stably supply the cooling medium to the axial passage . Moreover the restriction section D can flow the cooling medium from the cooling medium reservoir into the axial passage at an appropriate flow rate.

In the embodiment the passage cross sectional area of the cooling medium introduction passage is gradually reduced from the opening I on the cooling medium reservoir side the passage cross sectional area becomes at the minimum at the restriction section D and then the passage cross sectional area is gradually increased toward the opening E of the inlet I of the axial passage side. As described above the diameter of the cooling medium introduction passage is gradually reduced from the opening I toward the restriction section D and the diameter is gradually increased from the restriction section D toward the opening E so that there is an advantage that manufacture is facilitated in the case where the cooling medium introduction member is manufactured by casting such as die casting for example. The restriction section D is not limited to one as in the embodiment. For example such a configuration may be possible in which such a cooling medium introduction passage is used whose passage cross sectional area is constant between the opening I and the opening E and an orifice is mounted on a portion in the midway point to form the restriction section D. is an example in which the inner surface of the cooling medium introduction passage is changed in a curve in the cross section in parallel with the extending direction of the cooling medium introduction passage . However the inner surface of the cooling medium introduction passage may be changed linearly.

In the motor the cooling medium is stored in the cooling medium reservoir and introduced into the axial passage for cooling the rotor core and the coil. Thus the motor can stably supply the cooling medium into the inside of the housing even though the supply of the cooling medium from the pump illustrated in is unstable. As a result the motor can suppress the insufficient cooling of the coil of the stator and the magnets for example included in the rotor core and can suppress the insufficient lubrication of the bearing B and the oil seal so that a reduction in the durability of the components can be suppressed. Moreover in the motor the cooling medium is stored in the cooling medium reservoir in a certain amount and then supplied to the inside of the housing so that the motor can stably cool the coil for example and can stably exert the performance.

Furthermore the motor introduces the cooling medium stored in the cooling medium reservoir into the axial passage it can be suppressed that air flows from the opening I of the cooling medium introduction passage even though the rotational center axis Zr of the motor is tilted in the gravitational direction. As a result the motor can stably supply the cooling medium into the inside of the housing can suppress the insufficient cooling of the coil of the stator and the magnets included in the rotor core for example and can suppress the insufficient lubrication of the bearing B and the oil seal .

In addition the cooling medium is stored in the cooling medium reservoir near the cover existing on the boundary between the inside of the housing and the outside so that the effect of cooling the stator and the magnets included in the rotor core for example is improved. Moreover at the timing at which the motor needs the cooling medium a suction pressure is produced in the axial passage due to centrifugal force caused by the rotation of the rotor during the rotation of the rotor for example. When the suction pressure is produced because the cooling medium is stored in the cooling medium reservoir a larger amount of the cooling medium is supplied from the cooling medium reservoir to the rotor. As described above the motor can effectively supply the cooling medium to the rotor at the timing at which the cooling medium is needed.

Furthermore a certain amount of the cooling medium is stored in the cooling medium reservoir so that the amount of the cooling medium stored in the oil reservoir portion in the housing can be reduced during the operation of the motor . Thus the area of the rotor contacting the cooling medium stored in the oil reservoir portion can be reduced so that the rotational resistance of the rotor can be reduced. As a result the use efficiency of electric power is improved in the motor . Next the resolver will be described.

The resolver includes a resolver rotor R mounted on the shaft which is a rotating system and a resolver stator S mounted on the second flange which is a rest system. The resolver rotor R rotates together with the shaft . Therefore the resolver rotor R rotates about the rotational center axis Zr of the shaft . The resolver stator S of the resolver is fit into a rotation angle detection sensor holding portion which is a recess provided on the second flange . The shaft mounted with the resolver rotor R includes a step D whose outer diameter is greater than the inner diameter of the resolver rotor R and the step D retains the resolver rotor R.

The resolver is pressed against the second flange from one end portion of the shaft an end face Ta on which the axial passage is opened side by the cooling medium introduction member . The cooling medium introduction member is fixed to the second flange by a fixing member as a plate member. With this configuration the resolver more specifically the resolver stator S is fixed to the second flange . For example the fixing member can be manufactured as by punching and bending a metal plate member.

As illustrated in the cooling medium introduction member in a nearly cylindrical shape includes a shell B in a column shape and a protruding portion F provided on one end portion of the shell B and protruding toward the outer side of the shell B in the radial direction. The shell B includes a groove extending in the circumferential direction on the other end portion side that is on the end portion side opposite to the end portion where the protruding portion F is provided. As illustrated in the groove is provided with the O ring as a sealing member. The cooling medium introduction member is manufactured as by casting or die casting an aluminum alloy for example. Since the cooling medium introduction member is a member separate from the cover the cooling medium introduction member may be manufactured using a material different from the material of the cover . With this configuration an appropriate material can be used for the cooling medium introduction member and the accuracy of the cooling medium introduction member can also be improved.

The end face on the opposite side of the end face of the cooling medium introduction member on which the cooling medium reservoir is opened that is an end face Tb of the cooling medium introduction member on the protruding portion F side contacts the resolver stator S of the resolver . Moreover the end face of the cooling medium introduction member of the cooling medium introduction member that is an end face Ta on the groove side is fit into the recess U included in the cover and faces the recess U. It is noted that the cover is a portion at which the cooling medium supply unit illustrated in is provided in the housing .

As illustrated in the cooling medium introduction member includes a recess on the protruding portion F side. The recess is in a circular shape when seen on a plane having the smallest inner diameter on the end face Ta side on the groove side and a larger inner diameter on the end face Tb side of the protruding portion F. A portion at which the inner diameter of the recess is changed is a step D. As illustrated in a portion at which the shaft protrudes from the resolver rotor R of the resolver is inserted into the recess . The oil seal as a sealing member is provided between the shaft and the recess of the cooling medium introduction member . The step D retains the oil seal provided with the recess .

The flange projection is a portion protruding from the second flange and includes the intra projection space in the inside of the flange projection . The intra projection space is closed by mounting the cover on a projection end face T. The projection end face T is formed with a groove S. The groove S is mounted with an O ring . With this structure the O ring seals the projection end face T and the cover .

The cooling medium introduction member is disposed in the intra projection space and disposed between the cover and the second flange more specifically between the recess of the cover and the rotation angle detection sensor holding portion of the flange projection . The cooling medium introduction member is mounted on the rotation angle detection sensor holding portion and the cooling medium introduction member presses and fixes the resolver to the second flange . In the pressing the cooling medium introduction member presses the resolver from the end portion side of the shaft on which the inlet I is opened. The end face Ta on the groove side then protrudes on the outer side of the intra projection space beyond the projection end face T of the flange projection . The protruding cooling medium introduction member is fit into the recess U of the cover . The depth of the recess U is greater than a dimension from the projection end face T to the end face Ta on the groove side. Thus a space BS is formed between the end face Ta of the cooling medium introduction member on the groove side which is fit into the recess U and the recess U opposite to the end face Ta. For example the space BS avoids the contact between the resolver and the cover in the case where the cooling medium introduction member extends due to a temperature rise.

After the cooling medium introduction member presses the resolver the cooling medium introduction member is mounted on the second flange using the fixing member . The resolver is then fixed to the second flange through the fixing member and the cooling medium introduction member . When the cover is mounted on the flange projection the end face Ta of the cooling medium introduction member is fit into the recess U of the cover . However since the space BS is disposed between the recess U and the cooling medium introduction member it is avoided that force is applied from the cover to the resolver through the cooling medium introduction member .

In the embodiment the resolver is fixed to and held on the second flange using the cooling medium introduction member and the fixing member without using the cover . Namely the function of pressing and holding the resolver a resolver holding function is separated from the cover and the resolver holding function is provided on the cooling medium introduction member and the fixing member . The cover is provided with the function of sealing the intra projection space a projection space sealing function . In the case where a single member for example the cover includes both of the resolver holding function and the projection space sealing function it is difficult to implement the two functions unless the position accuracy between the member and the resolver and the position accuracy between the member and the projection end face T are increased. Namely it is difficult to implement the two functions unless the accuracy is increased at two positions in a single member. However in the embodiment since different members separately have the resolver holding function and the projection space sealing function it is unnecessary to provide the two functions on a single member. As a result it is unnecessary to increase accuracy at two positions in a single member. Namely it is possible to suppress the accuracy demanded for members used for fixing the resolver as a rotation angle detection sensor and for sealing the space in which the resolver is disposed so that there is an advantage that manufacture is facilitated.

In the embodiment the cover including the cooling medium supply unit including the second cooling medium distribution passage see and the cooling medium introduction member including the cooling medium introduction passage are formed as separate members. With this structure in the case where foreign substances are included in the cooling medium supply unit or the cooling medium introduction passage to cause a trouble for example the cover and the cooling medium introduction member can be dismounted from each other to easily clean the cooling medium supply unit or the cooling medium introduction passage for example. As described above the cover and the cooling medium introduction member are formed as separate members and the path of the cooling medium can be split into short units so that there is an advantage of the easy maintenance of the path of the cooling medium.

The space BS formed between the recess U of the cover and the cooling medium introduction member has the function of storing and holding the cooling medium supplied from the second cooling medium distribution passage . Therefore the volume of the cooling medium reservoir included in the cooling medium introduction member can be substantially increased. As a result the rotor and the stator of the motor can be more stably cooled or the rotational resistance of the rotor can be reduced by reducing the amount of the cooling medium stored in the oil reservoir portion .

The flange projection includes a connector mounting hole H on which the connector is mounted. The connector is mounted on the connector mounting hole H across a sealing member S from the intra projection space side of the flange projection . Since the flange projection is a part of the housing the connector is mounted on the housing . The connector appearing from the connector mounting hole H is electrically connected to the connector terminal of the connector and connects an external connector which is connected to a controller of the motor . With this configuration the controller can output the resolver and excites the resolver .

In the embodiment the size the height of the projection space of the intra projection space of the flange projection between the cover and an intra projection space bottom B the surface of the second flange on the cover side is a sufficient size for mounting the connector . With this configuration in the embodiment the connector is mounted on a wall A of the flange projection and at least a part of the connector can be disposed in the intra projection space . Next exemplary modifications of the embodiment will be described.

The cooling medium introduction member includes a cooling medium introduction passage having a curved portion B and a restriction section Da. The cooling medium introduction passage is opened on a side portion Sa of the cooling medium introduction member in a cylindrical shape and on a portion of the cooling medium introduction member opposite to the inlet I of the axial passage included in the shaft . The cooling medium introduction passage extends from the side portion Sa toward the rotational center axis Zr. The cooling medium introduction passage changes the orientation at an angle of 90 degrees at the curved portion B at the position of the rotational center axis Zr and extends along the rotational center axis Zr. The cooling medium introduction passage includes the restriction section Da between the side portion Sa and the curved portion B. In the cooling medium introduction passage an opening Ia on the side portion Sa side is joined to the opening of the passage on the space side using a joining passage .

The motor is disposed in such a way that the rotational center axis Zr is orthogonal to the gravitational direction or mounted on an object. In the disposition the motor is disposed in such a way that the cooling medium reservoir is positioned on the upper part for example. The cooling medium supplied from the cooling medium inlet is stored in the cooling medium reservoir and flows into the cooling medium introduction passage through the passage and the joining passage due to the action of gravity. The cooling medium flowing into the cooling medium introduction passage flows out of an opening Ea through the restriction section Da and flows into the inlet I of the axial passage .

The motor according to the embodiment described above is used in a so called a vertical position in which the rotational center axis Zr is disposed in parallel with the gravitational direction. On the contrary the motor according to the exemplary modification is used in a so called horizontal position in which the rotational center axis Zr is disposed orthogonal to the gravitational direction. As described above the motor in a horizontal position includes the cooling medium reservoir so that the operation and effect as similar to the operation and effect of the motor in a vertical position are exerted. The position of the restriction section Da included in the motor is not limited to the example described above. For example the restriction section Da may be provided on the downstream side of the passage or the curved portion B in the flowing direction of the cooling medium.

The cooling medium reservoir forming portion P is joined to the protruding portion F using the shaft portion S. The diameter of the shaft portion S is smaller than the diameter of the cooling medium reservoir forming portion P. The shaft portion S includes a cooling medium introduction passage penetrating from the cooling medium reservoir forming portion P toward the protruding portion F. The cooling medium introduction passage includes a restriction section Db an opening Ib opened on the cooling medium reservoir and an opening Eb opened on the inner side of the protruding portion F. Even the cooling medium introduction member in this shape exerts the operation and effect similar to the operation and effect of the cooling medium introduction member described above.

A cooling medium introduction passage penetrates through a cooling medium introduction member from the bottom of the cooling medium reservoir toward the end portion of the cooling medium introduction member opposite to the inlet I of the axial passage . The cooling medium introduction passage is connected to a branch passage on the downstream side of the restriction section D in the flowing direction of the cooling medium. The branch passage extends in the inside of the cooling medium introduction member in the direction crossing the rotational center axis Zr in the modification in the direction orthogonal to the rotational center axis Zr and the branch passage is opened on a side portion S of the cooling medium introduction member . The branch passage opened on the side portion S is connected to a joining passage disposed in the intra projection space .

The second flange includes a passage penetrating through the intra projection space and the position of the bearing B. The passage is opened at the position opposite to the bearing B and opened in the intra projection space . The joining passage described above is connected to the passage on the opposite side where the joining passage is connected to the branch passage . With this structure a part of the cooling medium in the cooling medium introduction passage is supplied to the bearing B through the branch passage the joining passage and the passage . The branch passage the joining passage and the passage function as bearing cooling medium passages that supply the cooling medium stored in the cooling medium reservoir to the bearing B.

During the operation of the motor the cooling medium stored in the cooling medium reservoir flows from the opening I into the cooling medium introduction passage and passes through the restriction section D. The cooling medium passing through the restriction section D flows into the opening E and the branch passage . The cooling medium flowing into the opening E arrow C1 flows from the inlet I of the shaft into the axial passage . The cooling medium flowing into the branch passage arrow C2 is supplied to the bearing B through the joining passage and the passage and the cooling medium cools and lubricates the joining passage and the passage .

The motor supplies the cooling medium stored in the cooling medium reservoir also to the bearing B so that the cooling medium can be stably supplied to the bearing B even though the supply of the cooling medium from the pump illustrated in is unstable. As a result it is possible to suppress the insufficient lubrication and the insufficient cooling of the bearing B. The branch passage is connected to the cooling medium introduction passage on the downstream side of the restriction section D in the flowing direction of the cooling medium. However the branch passage may be connected to the cooling medium introduction passage or the cooling medium reservoir on the upstream side of the restriction section D in the flowing direction of the cooling medium. Namely the cooling medium from the cooling medium reservoir may be branched to the bearing B on the downstream side or the upstream side of the restriction section D in the flowing direction of the cooling medium.

As described above the embodiment is described. However the embodiment is not limited to the foregoing description. Moreover the foregoing components include components that can be easily conceived by a person skilled in the art substantially the same components and components in the scope of so called equivalents. Furthermore the foregoing components can be appropriately combined. In addition the components can be variously omitted replaced or modified within the scope not deviating from the teachings of the embodiment.
