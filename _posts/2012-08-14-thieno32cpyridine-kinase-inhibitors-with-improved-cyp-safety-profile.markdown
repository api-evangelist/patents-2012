This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 632 183 filed Dec. 7 2009 which claims priority to provisional application Ser. No. 61 120 281 filed Dec. 5 2008 and provisional application Ser. No. 61 223 760 filed Jul. 8 2009.

This invention pertains to compounds that inhibit protein kinases such as Aurora kinases and the VEGFR and PDGFR families of kinases and which have an improved safety profile due to low CYP3A4 inhibition compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases using the compounds.

Mitosis is a process by which a complete copy of a duplicated genome is segregated by the microtuble spindle apparatus into two daughter cells. Aurora kinases key mitotic regulators required for genome stability have been found to be overexpressed in human tumors. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which inhibit Aurora kinases compositions comprising the inhibitors and methods of treating diseases during which Aurora kinases are unregulated or overexpressed.

The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is one of the primary biochemical mechanisms mediating eukaryotic cell signaling. This reaction is catalyzed by protein kinases that transfer the g phosphate group of ATP to hydroxyl groups on target proteins. 518 such enzymes exist in the human genome of which 90 selectively catalyze the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxyl groups Cytosolic tyrosine kinases reside intracellularly whereas receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs possess both extracellular and intracellular domains and function as membrane spanning cell surface receptors. As such RTKs mediate the cellular responses to environmental signals and facilitate a broad range of cellular processes including proliferation migration and survival.

RTK signaling pathways are normally highly regulated yet their over activation has been shown to promote the growth survival and metastasis of cancer cells. Dysregulated RTK signaling occurs through gene over expression or mutation and has been correlated with the progression of various human cancers.

The VEGF receptor VEGFR family consists of three RTKs KDR kinase insert domain containing receptor VEGFR2 FLT1 Fms like tyrosine kinase VEGFR1 and FLT4 VEGFR3 . These receptors mediate the biological function of the vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF A B C D E and placenta growth factor PlGF a family of homodimeric glycoproteins that bind the VEGF receptors with varying affinities.

KDR is the major mediator of the mitogenic angiogenic and permeability enhancing effects of VEGF A hereafter referred to as VEGF. Many different cell types are able to produce VEGF yet its biological activity is limited predominately to the vasculature by way of the endothelial cell selective expression of KDR. Not surprisingly the VEGF KDR axis is a primary mediator of angiogenesis the means by which new blood vessels are formed from preexisting vessels.

FLT1 binds VEGF VEGF B and placental growth factor. FLT1 is expressed on the surface of smooth muscle cells monocytes and hematopoietic stems cells in addition to endothelial cells. Activation of FLT1 signaling results in the mobilization of marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells that are recruited to tumors where they contribute to new blood vessel formation.

FLT4 mediates the signaling of VEGF C and VEGF D which mediate formation of tumor associated lymphatic vessels lymphangiogenesis . Lymphatic vessels are one of the routes by which cancer cells disseminate from solid tumors during metastasis.

The a and b isoforms of the platelet derived growth factor PDGF receptors occur as homodimers or a b heterodimers and are found most commonly on the surface of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. PDGFR b contributes to tumor angiogenesis through the proliferation and migration of pericytes the peri endothelial cells that associate with and stabilize immature blood vessels. In gliomas autocrine PDGFR stimulation brought about by the co expression of PDGF and PDGF receptors mediates tumor cell proliferation and survival.

CSF 1R is encoded by the cellular homolog of the retroviral oncogene v fms and is a major regulator of macrophage development. Macrophages are frequent components of tumor stroma and have been shown to modify the extracellular matrix in a manner beneficial to tumor growth and metastasis.

KIT is expressed by hematopoietic progenitor cells mast cells germ cells and by pacemaker cells in the gut interstitial cells of Cajal . It contributes to tumor progression by two general mechanisms namely autocrine stimulation by its ligand stem cell factor SCF and through mutations that result in ligand independent kinase activity.

FLT3 is normally expressed on hematopoietic stem cells where its interaction with FLT3 ligand FL stimulates stem cell survival proliferation and differentiation. In addition to being over expressed in various leukemia cells FLT3 is frequently mutated in hematological malignancies with approximately one third of patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML harboring activating mutations.

The identification of effective small compounds which specifically inhibit signal transduction and cellular proliferation by modulating the activity of tyrosine kinases to regulate

and modulate abnormal or inappropriate cell proliferation differentiation or metabolism is therefore desirable. In particular the identification of methods and compounds that specifically

inhibit the function of a tyrosine kinase which is essential for angiogenic processes or the formation of vascular hyperpermeability leading to edema ascites effusions exudates and macromolecular extravasation and matrix deposition as well as associated disorders would be beneficial.

Administered drugs are eliminated from the body either by excretion or by metabolism to one or more metabolites. One class of metabolizing enzymes that is particularly important in the metabolism of drugs is the cytochrome P450 also known as CYP or P450 family of enzymes. This is a large family of isoenzymes which has been divided into over 15 subfamilies. The CYP3A subfamily which includes CYP3A4 3A5 3A7 and 3A43 is responsible for the metabolism of about 60 of known therapeutic drugs. CYP3A4 in particular is the most abundant CYP isoenzyme in both liver and intestine and is involved in the metabolism of more than 50 of the clinically used drugs Mechanism Based Inhibition of Cytochrome P455 3A4 by Therapeutic Drugs. Clin. Pharmacokinet 2005 44 279 304 . Like all other CYP enzymes CYP3A4 is susceptible to both reversible and pseudo irreversible or irreversible mechanism based inhibition Time dependent CYP Inhibition. Expert Opin. Drug Metab. Toxicol. 2007 3 51 66 . Their low substrate specificity makes the CYP enzymes susceptible to inhibition by a wide variety of structurally distinct drugs.

As a result of CYP inhibition abrupt changes can occur with a co administered agent in a single individual leading to a substantial increase or decrease in the blood and tissue concentrations of a drug or metabolite. These types of changes can alter a drug s safety and efficacy profile in profound ways especially drugs with narrow therapeutic windows. As outlined in the FDA guidance to industry a detailed evaluation of the CYP inhibition potential is required of all new drug candidates Guidance for Industry. Drug Metabolism Drug Interaction Studies in the Drug Development Process Studies in Vitro. US FDA April 1997 .

This issue of drug drug interaction is very important in oncology treatment as patients are typically treated with multiple drugs. Thus reducing the risk of such interaction is an important consideration in the development of novel cancer therapeutics.

While thienopyridine compounds disclosed in WO2005 010009 display potent inhibition of Aurora and PDGFR VEGFR kinases they may also be inhibitors of CYP3A4. This invention pertains to novel thienopyridines of formula I which maintain potent inhibition of both Aurora kinases and the family of kinases encompassing PDGFR and VEGFR and also demonstrate at least a 10 30 fold reduction in CYP3A4 inhibition. Because the compounds of the present invention have significantly reduced CYP3A4 inhibition they are expected to display low drug drug interaction liability.

In addition to the reduction in CYP inhibition the compounds of the invention have demonstrated their utility in additional assays utilized to assess the suitability of the compounds as drug candidates. For instance the compounds of the invention demonstrate potency in whole cell assays e.g. in the Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell HUVEC assay and the assay measuring histone D3 phosphorylation and induction of polyploidy and suitable pharmokinetic properties e.g. oral clearance and oral bioavailability in vivo efficacy e.g. Uterine Edema model rodent flank and orthotopic tumor models cardiovascular safety CNS assessments and gastroinstestinal assays.

To determine Aurora B activity of representative compounds of the invention Active Aurora B enzyme recombinant residues 1 344 and INCENP recombinant GST fusion protein Upstate were incubated in wells of a 384 well plate with biotinylted histone H3 peptide residues 1 21 Upstate 1 mM ATP and various concentrations of inhibitors in a HEPES buffer pH 7.4 containing MgCl sodium othrovanadate and Triton X 100. After 1 hour the reaction was stopped with EDTA and anti phospho histone H3 Europium Cryptate Cis Bio and SA APC Phycolink Prozyme were added to detect the phosphopeptide. The amount of phosphorylation was determined by the time resolved fluorescence ratio of signals at 665 nm and 615 nm. The IC s were calculated by an exponential fit of the inhibition values with the inhibitor concentrations using Assay Explorer software.

To determine Aurora A and C activity of representative compounds of the invention Active Aurora A or C enzyme was incubated in wells of a 384 well plate with biotinylated STK substrate 2 Upstate 1 mM ATP and various concentrations of inhibitors in a Hepes buffer pH 7.4 containing MgCl sodium othrovanadate and Triton X 100. After 1 hour the reaction was stopped with EDTA and anti phospho STK antibody Europium Cryptate Upstate and SA XL665 Upstate were added to detect the phosphopeptide. The amount of phosphorylation was determined by the time resolved fluorescence ratio of signals at 665 nm and 615 nm. The ICs were calculated by an exponential fit of the inhibition values with the inhibitor concentrations using Assay Explorer software.

To determine the activity of the various kinases a homogenous time resolved fluorescence HTRF in vitro kinase assay was used. Mathis G. . J Biomol Screen 1999. 4 6 p. 309 314 Alfred J. Kolb Paul V. Kaplita David J. Hayes Young Whan Park Christine Pernell John S. Major and Gerard Mathis 1998 3 333 342. 

For example for KDR cKIT FLT1 CSF1R and FTL3 purified enzyme was mixed with 0.5 M N biotinylated substrate Biotin Ahx AEEEYFFLA amide SEQ. ID. 1 various concentrations of inhibitor in reaction buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.1 10 mM MgCl 2 mM MnCl 0.1 BSA and 1 mM DTT 40 L final volume ATP 1 mM final conc. in a black 384 well plate. After 60 minutes incubation at room temperature the reaction was quenched by addition of a buffered EDTA solution final approximate concentrations 30 mM EDTA 0.1 BSA 0.1 Triton X 100 and 0.24M KF and a solution of revelation agents to give 0.084 ng well streptavidin XL 665 Cis Bio and 6.5 ng well antiphsophotyrosine mAb PT66 K Europium kryptate was added to the reaction mixture. The quenched reaction was allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 hours and was then read in a time resolved fluorescence detector InVision Perkin Elmer at 620 nm and 665 nm sequentially with excitation. The ratio between the signal of 620 nm and 665 nm was used in the calculation of the IC.

Assays 200 L final volume were carried out in NUNC polypropylene deep well plates in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 using a microtiter plate shaker in a 37 C. incubator. Pooled human liver microsomes BD Gentest 50 g mL were incubated with 5 concentrations of test compound from 0.1 M to 10 M 1 mM NADPH Sigma and 2 M midazolam Sigma . A constant amount of dimethylsulfoxide 1 was added to the incubations with the test compounds and each analysis was performed in duplicate. For preincubation experiments Pre the microsomes test compounds and NADPH were mixed and incubated 30 minutes before addition of midazolam. For coincubation experiments Co the compounds microsomes and midazolam were mixed and the reaction initiated by addition of NADPH to the wells. In both protocols the complete reaction was terminated after 10 minutes of shaking by addition of 100 L of a 1 1 mixture of acetonitrile and methanol containing 0.33 M 1 hydroxytriazolam.

For analysis an aliquot of each well were transferred to an autosampler vial and 10 L injected onto a Shimadzu LC 10A HPLC system equipped with a YMC AQ 2.0 50 mm column. The components were separated using a gradient of 10 acetonitrile 0.1 acetic acid to 70 acetonitrile 0.1 acetic acid at a flow rate of at 0.4 mL minute over 5 minutes. Midazolam 1 hydroxytriazolam internal standard 1 hydroxymidazolam and 4 hydroxymidazolam were quantified by LC MS MS using an LCQ Duo ThermoFinnigan . The ratio of 1 hydroxymidazolam CYP 3A4 product and the internal standard at each concentration of compound was used to calculate the inhibition of activity relative to the ratio calculated for control incubations without inhibitor. In the absence of NADPH no hydroxylation of midazolam was observed. Ketoconazole was used as a standard inhibitor which at 0.1 M produces 70 80 inhibition of CYP 3A4. The IC the concentration at which 50 of the enzyme is inhibited was calculated for Examples 1 5 and Example 6 described as EXAMPLE 703 in WO 2005 10009 and is shown in Table 4 below.

The data in tables 2 3 and 4 illustrate the utility of the compounds of this invention as inhibitors of multiple kinases with the added benefit of reduced CYP inhibition.

Compounds described as having low CYP inhibition or as not inhibiting CYP are those compounds with an ICof 10 M in the above assay.

The structural homology between Aurora Protein Kinases A B and C is reported in Nature Reviews Cancer Vol. 4 December 2004.

It is expected that because the compound of this invention inhibits the activity of Aurora kinase B it could also have utility as an inhibitor of protein kinases having close structural homology thereto such as for example Aurora kinase A and Aurora kinase C.

This data demonstrates the utility of Example 1 as an inhibitor of Aurora kinase A and Aurora kinase B and Aurora kinase C.

Accordingly compounds of this invention are expected to have utility in treatment of diseases during which protein kinases such as any or all Aurora kinase family members are expressed.
