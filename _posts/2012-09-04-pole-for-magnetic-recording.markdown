title: Pole for magnetic recording
abstract: A method for forming a magnetic write pole with a trapezoidal cross-section is described. The method consists of first forming a magnetic seedlayer on a base followed by depositing a removable material layer on the seedlayer, and then a resist layer on the removable material layer. A trench is then formed in the resist, and the resist is heated to cause the cross -sectional profile of the trench to assume a trapezoidal shape. The resist is then capped with another resist layer and further heated to cause the width of the trapezoidal trench to become narrower. The cap layer and removable material layer at the bottom of the trench are then removed and the trench filled with magnetic material by electroplating. The resist and seedlayer external to the trench are finally removed to form a write pole with a trapezoidal cross-section.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 116 798 entitled Fabrication of Trapezoidal Pole for Magnetic Recording filed May 7 2008 expected to issue on Sep. 4 2012 as U.S. Pat. No. 8 259 411 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with United States Government support under Agreement No. 70NANB1H3056 awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST . The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates to magnetic recording heads and more particularly to the fabrication of a trapezoidal write pole.

Magnetic recording heads have utility in a magnetic disc drive storage system. Most magnetic recording heads used in such systems today are longitudinal magnetic recording heads. Longitudinal magnetic recording in its conventional form has been projected to suffer from superparamagnetic instabilities at densities above approximately 40 Gbit in. It is believed that reducing or changing the bit cell aspect ratio will extend this limit up to approximately 100 Gbit in. However for recording densities above 100 Gbit in different approaches will likely be necessary to overcome the limitations of longitudinal magnetic recording.

An alternative to longitudinal recording that overcomes at least some of the problems associated with the superparamagnetic effect is perpendicular magnetic recording. Perpendicular magnetic recording is believed to have the capability of extending recording densities well beyond the limits of longitudinal magnetic recording. Perpendicular magnetic recording heads for use with a perpendicular magnetic storage medium may include a pair of magnetically coupled poles including a main write pole having a relatively small bottom surface area and a flux return pole having a larger bottom surface area. A coil having a plurality of turns is located adjacent to the main write pole for inducing a magnetic field between the pole and a soft underlayer of the storage media. The soft underlayer is located below the hard magnetic recording layer of the storage media and enhances the amplitude of the field produced by the main pole. This in turn allows the use of storage media with higher coercive force. Consequently more stable bits can be stored in the media. In the recording process an electrical current in the coil energizes the main pole which produces a magnetic field. The image of this field is produced in the soft underlayer to enhance the field strength produced in the magnetic media. The flux density that diverges from the tip into the soft underlayer returns through the return flux pole. The return pole is located sufficiently far apart from the main write pole such that the material of the return pole does not affect the magnetic flux of the main write pole which is directed vertically into the hard layer and the soft underlayer of the storage media.

A magnetic recording system such as for example a perpendicular magnetic recording system may utilize a write pole with a square or rectangular cross section. Under certain circumstances the increased magnetic field concentration at the sharp corners can cause writing or erasure on adjacent tracks.

Another development that overcomes at least some of the problems associated with the superparamagnetic effect is heat assisted magnetic recording HAMR sometimes referred to as optical or thermal assisted recording. Heat assisted magnetic recording generally refers to the concept of locally heating a recording medium to reduce the coercivity of the recording medium so that the applied magnetic writing field can more easily direct the magnetization of the recording medium during the temporary magnetic softening of the recording medium caused by the heat source. The heat assisted magnetic recording allows for the use of small grain media which is desirable for recording at increased aerial densities with a larger magnetic anisotropy at room temperature and assuring a sufficient thermal stability.

More specifically super paramagnetic instabilities become an issue as the grain volume is reduced in order to control media noise for high aerial density recording. The superparamagnetic effect is most evident when the grain volume V is sufficiently small that the inequality KV kT 40 can no longer be maintained. Kis the magnetic crystalline anisotropy energy density of the material kis Boltzman s constant and T is absolute temperature. When this inequality is not satisfied thermal energy demagnetizes the individual grains and the stored data bits will not be stable. Therefore as the grain size is decreased in order to increase the aerial density a threshold is reached for a given material Kand temperature T such that stable data storage is no longer feasible.

The thermal stability can be improved by employing a recording medium formed of a material with a very high K. However with the available materials the recording heads are not able to provide a sufficient or high enough magnetic writing field to write on such a medium. Accordingly it has been proposed to overcome the recording head field limitations by employing thermal energy to heat a local area on the recording medium before or at about the time of applying the magnetic write field to the medium. By heating the medium the Kor the coercivity is reduced such that the magnetic write field is sufficient to write to the medium. Once the medium cools to ambient temperature the medium has a sufficiently high value of coercivity and assures thermal stability of the recorded information. When applying a heat or light source to the medium it is desirable to confine the heat or light to the track where writing is taking place and to generate the write field in close proximity to where the medium is heated to accomplish high aerial density recording. The separation between the heated spot and the write field spot should be minimal or as small as possible so that the writing may occur while the medium temperature is substantially above ambient temperature. This also provides for the efficient cooling of the medium once the writing is completed.

Accordingly there is identified a need for an improved write pole with a shape and dimensions that overcome the limitations and shortcomings of known magnetic recording heads and heat assisted magnetic recording heads.

In one aspect of the invention a method of forming a magnetic write pole with a trapezoidal cross section is presented. The method comprises forming a magnetic seedlayer on a base forming a removable material layer on the seedlayer forming a resist layer on the removable layer and forming a trench in the resist and heating the structure for a first amount of time at a first temperature to form a predetermined slope in the first and second sidewalls of the trench. The method further comprises capping the trench with another resist layer and heating the capped trench for a second amount of time at a second temperature to shrink the separation of the first and second sidewalls of the trench removing the cap layer and the removable material at the bottom of the trench electroplating a magnetic material in the trench and removing the resist by stripping the resist and finally removing the seed material outside the pole area by ion beam etching to form the magnetic pole.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention a magnetic write pole with a multilayer structure and a trapezoidal cross section comprises a base and a multilayer magnetic seedlayer on the base. A magnetic layer on the seedlayer has a trapezoidal cross section a bottom width Wless than or equal to about 100 nm a top width of about 1.25 to 3 times W a height h and an aspect ratio h Wof about 1 1 to about 10 1.

The present invention relates to the problem of side writing or erasure on adjacent tracks due to magnetic field concentrations at sharp corners in prior art write poles with rectangular cross sections as seen from the air bearing surface ABS of a recording media. shows a cross section of prior art write pole as seen from the ABS. Write pole has three sections and . The shading on illustrates magnetic field concentrations capable of side writing or erasure. The embodiment of the invention is to replace sections and with a single pole having a trapezoidal cross section with a bottom spacing at its tip and a top spacing to form write pole as shown in . Furthermore by making the spacing of section in equal to top spacing the corners responsible for magnetic field leakage are eliminated. In another embodiment of the invention the aspect ratio H W of the trapezoidal pole is about 1 1 to about 10 1 to keep the wider portions away from the bottom edge front edge of the pole that does the writing. In another embodiment of the invention the magnetization of the trapezoidal pole is graded to ensure that the field from the top of the pole is lower than the field from the bottom of the pole since writing is done at the bottom of the pole.

Prior art trapezoidal poles have been fabricated using high angle ion beam etching with masking to create the trapezoidal shape. This process is not compatible with the process used to form heat assisted magnetic recording HAMR heads. A process that is compatible with the HAMR process is electroplating in a resist trench with a trapezoidal shape.

The disclosed invention solves the following issues. 1 The trench has a trapezoidal shape. 2 The trench width at the bottom is less than 100 nm. 3 The aspect ratio H W is about 1 1 to about 10 1. 4 Removing the seedlayer without leaving a footing or redepositing seedlayer material on the sides of the pole. 5 Backfilling with alumina without leaving voids in the alumina. 6 The process needs to be compatible with standard processes in industry fabs.

The invention discloses how to form a narrow trench with a controlled trapezoidal shape and controllable top and bottom separations. In summary the method is a hybrid thermal flow process consisting of a resist post development thermal bake treatment process that allows a sub 100 nm high aspect ratio trench with a trapezoidal shape to be formed that can then be used as a template for electroplating writer pole materials.

The steps to form a magnetic pole with a trapezoidal cross section are given in . First a substrate is provided step . The substrate can be a ceramic composite used to form sliders such as an aluminum oxide titanium oxide composite or other materials known in the art. A plating seedlayer is deposited on the substrate step . Suitable seedlayers are selected from a group but are not limited to FeCo NiFe CoNiFe Ru Ta CoZrTa CoNbTa and Cu.

A thin easily removable resist layer is deposited on the seedlayer step . The removable layer is preferably about 10 nm to about 30 nm thick and is preferably a polymethylglutarimide PMGI layer. The removable layer is then given a post apply bake step . A thicker top resist layer is then deposited on the PMGI layer with a thickness of from about 0.5 m to about 4.0 m depending on the requirements for the top pole design step . The resist is then given a post apply bake step . The resist is then exposed using e beam or other lithographic tools e.g. G line I line DUV 193 nm scanner electron beam direct write EUV x ray lithography or others step . The exposed wafer is then given a post exposure bake step . The exposed wafer is then developed in standard tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide TMAH developer to form a rectangular trench step . The developed wafer is then put through a hybrid thermal flow process described later to produce the proper trapezoidal shape and spacing of the trench step . Magnetic material is then electroplated in the trench to form a magnetic trapezoidal pole step .

The hybrid thermal flow process is composed of two processes a thermal bake process and a thermal shrink process. In the thermal bake process the resist is baked at a temperature close to the glass transition temperature Tg of the resist. This causes the walls of the trench to slope into a trapezoidal cross section as shown in . shows resist layer with trench on substrate before thermal bake process. shows resist layer after thermal bake. Trench with rectangular cross section has transformed into trench with trapezoidal cross section after the bake.

The thermal shrink process is illustrated in where resist layer on substrate with a rectangular trench is capped with resist layer . Resist layer is applied by spin coating and fills the trench during the process. The spacing of the trench is a . The resist is then baked at a temperature less than equal to or greater than that used for the thermal bake process. This thermal shrink process causes the separation of the two walls of the trench to decrease giving an added dimension to the control of the trapezoidal trench forming process. The new spacing is b where b

An example of how a trapezoidal shape is formed in a 1.3 m thick resist with a rectangular trench during a thermal bake is shown in . Scanning electron microscope SEM images of the trench are shown at different temperatures after a 60 second bake at different temperatures in . The bottom and top spacing of the trench as well as the bevel angle are shown in as a function of temperature for a 60 second baking time. The top spacing and bevel angle are smoothly varying functions of temperature while the bottom spacing remained constant.

The plating process to form a trapezoidal pole starts with step in deposit seedlayer. Although the seedlayer used in this process is described in detail other seedlayers and combinations of seedlayers can be used. A schematic showing the layer structure of the seed and resist layers is shown in where the relative dimensions are not to scale. All layers in seedlayer can be formed by physical vapor deposition PVD e beam vapor deposition sputtering and other means known to those in the art. The seedlayer has two characteristics a laminated layer structure and an anticorrosion cap. Seedlayer is shown on substrate and includes first or bottom layer on substrate . First layer is NiFe about 15 thick. Second layer is CoNiFe about 350 thick. Third layer on CoNiFe layer is Ta about 12 in thickness. Fourth layer includes three NiFe layers about 15 thick each. Fifth layer on NiFe layer is CoNiFe about 250 thick. Sixth or cap layer is NiFeabout 50 thick and is added for anticorrosion protection as will be discussed below. Easily removable resist layer is on cap layer . Layer is preferably a PMGI layer about 10 nm to 30 nm thick and is applied to protect the seedlayer at the base of the trench during subsequent thermal processing. Thick resist layer is on thin easily removable layer . Resist layer is from 0.5 m to 4.0 m thick depending on the requirements of the pole design.

Magnetic properties of laminate seedlayer are compared with a single CoNiFe layer in . shows B versus H hysteresis loops for a solid 1000 CoNiFe film and shows B versus H hysteresis loops for a 1000 laminate film. The hard axis loop of the laminate shows almost no hysteresis.

In another embodiment of this invention the magnetization of each magnetic layer in the seedlayer can be different such that the seedlayer exhibits a vertical magnetization gradient which can contribute to the magnetization gradient in the write pole.

The plating process flow to form a trapezoidal pole is shown in which shows the steps to electroplate a magnetic trapezoidal pole. At step removable layer at the bottom of the trench is removed to expose the seedlayer. This is carried out by Oreactive ion etching to clear trench bottom. Next etching removes surface oxide on the seedlayer step . An acid spray etch performs this process. At step the trench is filled with magnetic material by electroplating. Solid FeCoNi FeCo and graded magnetization poles can be formed. Following electroplating the plated trench is rinsed and dried to remove plating solution step . In the next step the photoresist is removed by oxygen ashing and solvent stripping step . As discussed later in the final step the exposed seedlayer is removed by ion beam etching step .

Referring to Table 1 the organic STJ additive acts as a leveling agent and plays an important role in controlling the grain size and surface morphology of the plated pole. Its adsorption to the narrow trench surface can be preferentially enhanced due to radial transportation at the current crowding points thereby increasing plating uniformity. Due to the trapezoidal profile of the trench cross section the accessibility of the small trench by the diffusing metal ions can be increased. This improves the uniformity of the plated pole cross section along the length of the pole.

As illustrated in prior art poles are solid plated high Ms CoFeNi material for sections and . This high Ms configuration results in a magnetic field spike at the back of the pole . In order to reduce this field spike trapezoidal poles with an Ms gradient can be employed. A schematic of a trapezoidal graded Ms pole is shown in .

Three different pole materials with different magnetization can be plated to form this pole. For example in the current seedlayer configuration sputtered Si on substrate NiFe 15 CoNiFe 250 Ta 12 NiFe 15 CoNiFe 250 NiFe50 it is possible to subsequently plate 100 nm of 1 T NiFe layer using a regular NiFe bath and 50 nm of 0.5 T NiCu on the 1 T NiFe layer and 50 nm of 0.3 T NiCu layer on the 0.5 T NiCu layer using another bath.

The 0.3 T and 0.5 T NiCu layers can be plated from a single bath using the novel developed bath chemistry shown in Table 2.

In the single bath method deposition is carried out using a single electrolyte while varying deposition parameters such as voltage or current to produce compositional structural and magnetic modulations of the plated structure. For example current density is shown as a function of applied voltage in cyclic voltammetry measurements made using the bath given in Table 2 where ions of two metals Cu and Ni with Cu being more noble than Ni are present. At certain potentials or currents that are sufficiently negative Cu will be reduced and Ni will not. In this region region I in Cu will be plated and Ni will not. As the potential is decreased into region II both Cu and Ni will plate and the amounts of each will depend on the applied potential. As shown in a 0.3 T NiCu alloy will plate at a current density of about 2.5 mA cmand a 0.5 T NiCu alloy will plate at a current density of 10.0 mA cm. Since the deposition rate of Cu is diffusion limited and hence constant by varying the potential or current during plating composition and magnetic modulations of the plated structure can be achieved.

The current control technique is employed in the wafer scale embodiment described here. shows the composition and magnetic moment variation in NiCu plated layers as a function of plating current. As shown in the figure the magnetic moment Bs can be conveniently tailored by adjusting the plating current. Specifically 2.5 and 10 mA cmcurrents can be applied to obtain 0.3 T and 0.5 T NiCu. The composition uniformity 1 for 0.5 T and 0.3 T NiCu plated layers are 0.1 0.5 T and 0.7 0.3 T respectively.

The microstructure of the 0.5 T and 0.3 T NiCu are shown in as characterized by scanning electron microscopy SEM . The surface looks sound and glossy and the grains are refined due to the use of the STJ organic additive in the bath. The magnetic hysteresis loop of an actual rated Ms stack is shown in . The stack consists of 50 nm of 0.3 T NiCu on 50 nm of 0.5 T NiCu on 100 nm of 1 T NiFe on 100 nm of CoNiFe laminate seed.

A seed removal method that works best is a static etch with the wafer stationary with the poles at a 30 angle with respect to the ion beam i.e. 30 as shown in . In another embodiment the wafer can be swept through a range of angles e.g. from about 20 to about 40 . As shown in the figure the wafer is also set at 50 i.e. 50 to the ion beam.

Successful seed removal using this process is shown in . is an SEM image of a seed with an 86 wall angle with no redeposited seed material on the wall of the seed. The bottom middle and top widths of the pole are 90 nm 130 nm and 185 nm respectively.

Conventional sputtering such as with Alcatel Comptech equipment cannot be used to backfill the pole with alumina. is an SEM image of a pole that was backfilled with sputtered alumina using Comptech equipment. There are voids along the sides of the pole as indicated by the arrows. However ion beam deposition can be used to backfill the pole. shows two magnifications of SEM images of a pole backfilled with 1.2 m of ion beam deposited IBD alumina deposited at 60 with the wafer rotating. There are no voids in the alumina.

SEM images of three trapezoidal poles with different dimensions that have been fabricated by the invention disclosed herein are shown in . The top images are end on views of vertical cross sections of the poles. The bottom images are perspective views of the unsectioned poles. The bottom and top widths i.e. critical dimension or CD are indicated on the figure.

In summary a novel hybrid thermal flow method to form trapezoidal shape resist trench structures has been invented that allows the production of trapezoidal write poles by electroplating. This process has been used to manufacture heat assisted magnetic recording heads HAMR .

Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
