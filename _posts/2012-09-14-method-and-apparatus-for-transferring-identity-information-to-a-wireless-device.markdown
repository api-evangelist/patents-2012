title: Method and apparatus for transferring identity information to a wireless device
abstract: A method and apparatus for transferring identity information for temporary use by a wireless device, visiting a foreign operator network, is provided. A user is presented, at a kiosk, with an opportunity to download a temporary identity which is recognized by the operator network as belonging to a local subscriber, and the user may make a request for service. In response to the user-generated request for service, local identity information is transferred to the wireless device for use thereby. The transfer is short-range wireless communication from the kiosk to the wireless device. The temporary identity, once installed on the wireless device, makes the wireless device appear as a local subscriber. Upon termination of use, the temporary identity is returned to a pool and usable for another wireless device.

This application is a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 12 854 093 filed Aug. 10 2010 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present subject matter pertains in general to wireless communications and in particular to a method and apparatus for transferring identity information for example of the kind stored on a universal integrated circuit card UICC to a wireless device for temporary permanent or quasi permanent use.

Wireless networks in general and cellular networks such as GSM UMTS CDMA and other networks in particular typically require wireless devices such as mobile phones PDAs or other cellular devices to present identity information before granting access to the network. This identity information is used for example for billing purposes for routing communication to the wireless device identifying the wireless device within a network and the like. Identity information may be associated with an identity module such as a subscriber identity module SIM CDMA SIM CSIM Universal SIM USIM or the like. For example identity information may include an international mobile subscriber identity IMSI number as stored in a SIM and used to identify a subscriber to GSM and UMTS networks.

Identity information may be stored on a removable or non removable storage medium or smart card such as a universal integrated circuit card UICC . A UICC may hold multiple applications corresponding to different identity modules. Thus the same UICC can potentially be used with different networks operating in accordance with different standards. The UICC smart card typically consists of a CPU ROM RAM EEPROM and I O circuits and is configured to run one or more applications such as identity module applications.

Mobile devices are typically associated with a home network via the identity information stored thereon but are often required to connect to other networks for example while travelling or roaming. Current billing arrangements and roaming agreements can make it expensive to use communication networks other than a home network. For example a user may subscribe to a service that allows the communication of tens of Megabytes of data for an acceptable monthly fee but may be charged a much higher fee per Megabyte when roaming in other countries or service areas. This expense can discourage the use of communications services when roaming Those who are unaware of the expense of service are frequently surprised when they receive an expensive bill and this leads to disputes with the service providers.

One of the reasons for such high costs is an ongoing lack of trust between service providers with respect to billing. In some cases visitors to a foreign location may have their data traffic sent via an expensive dedicated leased connection back to their home service provider so that billing can be performed by their home service provider. This may ensure accuracy of invoicing but does not serve the user in terms of reasonable price for the service. The limitations of the link also introduce delay and may limit the speed of the connection.

Some technically knowledgeable users who travel frequently may obtain a wireless device that can accept the UICC card of any service provider. This can be achieved by purchasing a device that has been unlocked or by paying a fee to get a code from their home service provider to enable unlocking. Buying an unlocked device is more expensive to the user at the outset than buying a device that is locked and subsidized by their home network operator. In an unlocked device the user may remove a UICC card configured for use with their home network and install a UICC card purchased from another more local provider in order to take advantage of lower rates. This is an inconvenience in that the removal and exchanging of the card can require the device to be opened up and the battery removed before access to the card can be achieved. It is also inconvenient where the device has voice capability as the card defines the telephone number of the device because the number changes when the card is changed.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

One aspect of the present subject matter includes a method form for transferring identity information to a wireless device for use. The method is configured to enabling a wireless device for local operation with a foreign operator network.

The term wireless device is used to refer to an apparatus for analog and or digital transmission and or reception of signals for communication purposes via electromagnetic radiation propagating for example through vacuum or air or a generally non conductive medium to or from another apparatus. The wireless device may use signals formatted according to one or more of a number of communication systems including mobile phone networks such as cellular networks or other current or future wireless communication systems for example. A wireless device can comprise or be included in one or more of various forms of handheld or mobile devices such as a radio mobile phone cellular phone satellite phone media player smart phone or a personal computer PC such as a desktop notebook tablet PC personal digital assistant PDA game console or peripherals such as a printer camera pointing device or other apparatus for example.

In accordance with embodiments of the present subject matter a wireless device is configured to hold identity information for example on a removable or non removable smart card such as a UICC. Identity information may be associated with an application such as a SIM CSIM USIM or the like. Identity information may comprise one or more identifiers such as telephone number IMSI IMEI ESN MEID MSISDN password PIN username user information network affiliations country or regional affiliations and the like.

The term base station is used to refer to a wireless device operating as an access point for coupling other wireless devices such as mobile phones to other parts of a communication network. The base station comprises a radio transceiver for communication with the other wireless devices in accordance with one or more wireless communication protocols for example cellular communication protocols such as CDMA CDMA2000 UMTS GSM LTE or other wireless protocols such as WLAN protocols. The base station further comprises an interface to a wired or wireless backhaul or other infrastructure for coupling with the other parts of the communication network such as a mobile network operator s core network the Internet or a combination thereof or the like. A base station may be for example a wireless access point a macrocell microcell picocell or femtocell base station a base transceiver station BTS a NodeB an evolved NodeB or the like.

The term operator network is used to refer to a communication network comprising one or more base stations and operated by one or more entities such as a business entity wireless service provider government or public entity alliance of private citizens businesses or corporations or the like. As used herein the term foreign operator network refers to an operator network with respect to which a wireless device under discussion is not currently a local or direct subscriber. Such a wireless device may also be reciprocally referred to as foreign to the operator network. As an example a device which does not belong to an operator s subscription service may be deemed as foreign to that operator s network or networks.

The term kiosk is used to refer to a booth public computer terminal computer kiosk vending machine reprogramming tool associated with a location or other establishment accessible by the public and comprising an automated user interface by which a user can initiate and optionally pay for services such as those described herein. The user interface may comprise a physical user interface such as a touch screen for example.

In some embodiments a kiosk may be a physical kiosk. In other embodiments a kiosk may be a virtual kiosk. A virtual kiosk may for example comprise a server configured for communication with wireless devices via a wireless network such as a Wi Fi network cellular network a public Wi Fi network or other wireless network as would be readily understood by a worker skilled in the art. The physical user interface in this case comprises the user interface of a wireless device carried by a potential user of the technology.

The term short range wireless communication is used to refer to point to point or single hop wireless communication methods such as near field communication NFC Bluetooth and the like.

As used herein the term about refers to a 10 variation from the nominal value. It is to be understood that such a variation is always included in a given value provided herein whether or not it is specifically referred to.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this subject matter belongs.

In accordance with an aspect of the present subject matter there is provided a method for enabling a wireless device for local operation with a foreign operator network. A wireless device visiting a foreign operator network may be enabled for local operation for example if it is recognized by the foreign operator network as equivalent to a local subscriber of the foreign operator network. Local operation is contrasted with prior art methods such as operation under a roaming agreement in which a wireless device is not recognized as equivalent to a local subscriber. The method comprises monitoring for and receiving user generated request for services made at a kiosk thereby identifying the wireless device as foreign to the operator network. The method further comprises transferring via wireless communication local identity information such as identity information of the kind stored on a UICC recognized by the operator network as being associated with a local subscriber to the wireless device. The transfer is typically done from a wireless transceiver of the kiosk to the wireless device by a suitable protocol such as a NFC or Bluetooth . The wireless communication may thus be short range wireless communication when the mobile wireless device is proximate to the kiosk. The local identity information representative of a local identity is suitable for temporary permanent or quasi permanent use by the wireless device to facilitate operation of the wireless device with the operator network as a local subscriber. In some embodiments if the local identity information is later released by the wireless device it is further suitable for temporary permanent or quasi permanent use by one or more other wireless devices after said temporary use by the wireless device.

In accordance with another aspect of the present subject matter there is provided an apparatus for enabling a wireless device for local operation with a foreign operator network. The apparatus may optionally be operatively coupled to the operator network for example via a wired or wireless communication link. The apparatus comprises at least a physical user interface and a wireless interface module such as a short range wireless interface module. A short range wireless interface module may be configured for wireless communication via NFC or Bluetooth for example. The physical user interface is configured to receive a user generated request for service thereby identifying the wireless device as foreign to the operator network. The wireless interface module is configured to transfer local identity information from the apparatus to the wireless device via wireless communication. The local identity information may be retrieved from a database containing currently available local identities each being representative of respective local identity information.

In accordance with embodiments of the present subject matter the wireless device is configured to temporarily adopt the identity information as its own so as to appear as equivalent to a local subscriber. For example this may involve configuring and launching a SIM application or the like which incorporates the local identity information.

Transferring of the local identity information to the wireless device is typically performed subsequently to interfacing with a user of the wireless device for example to obtain authorization and payment or credit information. In some embodiments the present subject matter is additionally directed toward obtaining payment information from a user of the wireless device said payment information for use in recovering payment related to use of the local identity information by the wireless device in accordance with a predetermined service agreement and initiating a request for payment based at least in part on said payment information. For example the present subject matter may be configured to communicate with the user via the kiosk to offer use of local identity information for a fee receive a message accepting or declining the offer request receive and authenticate payment information upon acceptance and communicate the required local identity information to the wireless device upon receipt and authentication of the payment information.

In some embodiments the present subject matter is further directed toward storing a plurality of different identities in computer memory and accessing the computer memory to acquire the local identity information corresponding to a selected identity stored therein. The selected identity corresponds to a local identity which is marked as currently unused. Once it has been selected and possibly provided to the wireless device for use the selected identity is marked as currently in use. The computer memory may be organized as a database or other data structure for example and marking a selected identity may comprise marking a first field in the database or data structure the first field being linked to a second field containing the appropriate identity. In a further embodiment the present subject matter may be additionally directed toward monitoring for completion of temporary use of the local identity information and upon completion of temporary use of the local identity information by the wireless device marking the selected identity as currently unused. Monitoring for completion may be performed by monitoring for a return user visit to the original kiosk or an associated kiosk to release the local identity information by monitoring for a remote message SMS message email or the like from the user indicative that the local identity information is being released by monitoring the local network to detect a lapse in use of the local identity information or the like. In some embodiments the local identity information is only marked as unused upon an explicit release action performed by the user. Therefore an identity may be checked out of the database when it is being used and subsequently checked in again once it is no longer required. In some embodiments local identity information associated with the respective local identity may be kept indefinitely for use upon future visits. Identities may therefore be supplied serially to different wireless devices typically with the restriction that a single identity is only used by one wireless device at a time although this restriction may be relaxed if feasible.

In some embodiments authorized usage of the local identity information may be configured to expire after a predetermined usage limit is reached. For example a user may pre pay for use of the local identity information for a predetermined number of days amount of data number of text messages or voice minutes or a combination thereof or the like.

After the predetermined usage limit is reached the mobile network may be configured to deny further services to the wireless device when using the local identity information unless usage is extended by further payment. The local identity information may then be returned to a pool for re use. The local identity information will be marked as expired until it is reissued from the pool. For added security the mobile network may be configured to read a permanent identifier of the wireless device as well as the local identity information to ensure that the wireless device currently attempting to use the local identity information is currently the one wireless device authorized to do so.

Alternatively the apparatus may interface with users via the users own wireless device. For example the apparatus may be configured to communicate via Wi Fi with the wireless device. The apparatus may comprise a Wi Fi transceiver for this purpose or may use the services of another hotspot or wireless access point. The apparatus may comprise a web server and may interface with the users wireless device via a web browser operating on the wireless device for example. Some or all of the functional aspects of the apparatus may thus be virtualized.

For example the apparatus may comprise a server operatively coupled to a network such as a public Wi Fi network servicing an airport or other location. When a user connects to the network they may be given the option to engage services provided by the apparatus. The user may then interact with the server via a web browser or other suitable application on their wireless device thereby interacting with the kiosk. This configuration allows users to engage the kiosk as a virtual kiosk without the need to find a physical kiosk. In some embodiments a physical kiosk may comprise wireless communication capabilities thereby functioning as both a physical and virtual kiosk. Although a Wi Fi network has relatively longer range than NFC or Bluetooth wireless links it may be considered relatively short range when compared with cellular networks metropolitan area networks and the like.

The short range wireless interface module is configured to communicate wirelessly with the wireless device via an available means such as Bluetooth or NFC. In some embodiments user identity information wireless device identity information and or payment information may be retrieved automatically from the wireless device via the short range wireless interface module rather than being provided by the user. After initial interaction between the apparatus and the user the short range wireless interface module communicates with the wireless device to transfer local identity information thereto. The local identity information may be transferred in an appropriate format and to an appropriate degree such that the wireless device is able to use the local identity information as its own identity at least for purposes of interfacing with the foreign operator network for example to run a SIM or other application on a smart card or smart card emulator or the like. The short range wireless interface module typically obtains the local identity information from computer memory which may contain a pool of identities for example in a database. As illustrated the computer memory may be provided within the apparatus . Alternatively the identities may be stored remotely and retrieved as required. The computer memory may serve as a cache memory for local identities and this memory may be updated periodically on the direction of a remote server.

The apparatus may be operatively coupled via a network interface to an operator network to which a foreign wireless device may connect. The local identity information is provided for use with the operator network . The apparatus may comprise an optional monitoring module which may be operatively coupled to the operator network via the network interface . The monitoring module is configured to monitor the operator network for signs that local identity information representative of the local identity and previously provided to the wireless device is no longer in use by that wireless device. In that case the local identity is marked as currently unused in the computer memory . Although the monitoring module is illustrated within the apparatus it or a portion thereof may be provided via a remote server. In some embodiments this may comprise involvement of the network operator to grant the apparatus access to information held by the operator network . For example the monitoring module may be configured to monitor data held in a register or server of the operator network . The monitoring module may determine that a particular local identity is no longer in use for example if the local identity information thereof has not been used for a predetermined number of days weeks or months.

In some embodiments the apparatus may further comprise a payment module . The payment module may be configured to obtain payment information via the user interface module and or card reader . Additionally or alternatively the payment module may be configured to communicate with the wireless device via the short range wireless interface module and or network interface and wireless network to obtain payment information. Payment information is generally for use in recovering payment related to use of the local identity information by the wireless device . The payment module is further configured to initiate a request for payment based at least in part on said payment information for example by contacting a financial agency such as a credit card bank escrow service or the like identified in the payment information. In some embodiments the service may be pre paid.

In some embodiments the apparatus may be a computer or computer server comprising a processor operatively coupled to computer memory. The computer memory contains instructions for operation of the apparatus including the user interface module the short range wireless interface module and optionally the monitoring module and or the payment module . The computer memory may also contain the pool of identities and instructions for execution by the processor for managing same. The apparatus may further comprise a network interface for operatively coupling to one or more devices in the operator network thereby facilitating communicative coupling therewith. The network interface may be for example an Ethernet interface IP interface ATM interface SS7 interface or other optical wired or wireless interface comprising one or more standard or proprietary protocols for interfacing with the operator network as would be readily understood by a worker skilled in the art. The payment module may include a communication interface for contacting a financial agency for requesting payment associated with use of the local identity information. The communication interface may be an interface for communicating with the Internet for example. In some embodiments the network interface and communication interface may be unified into a single interface for example comprising a communication interface operatively coupled to the Internet and the operator network .

An alternative apparatus is illustrated in . The apparatus comprises a terminal and a server . The terminal may be a kiosk style terminal such as illustrated in comprising at least the user interface module and the short range wireless interface module as described above. The server comprises the monitoring module local identity storage network interface payment module and financial agency communication interface again as described above. The terminal may further comprise a local identity cache that temporarily stores at least one local identity retrieved from the local identity storage of the server . Each local identity has associated therewith respective local identity information. The terminal and the server are operatively coupled via a secure communication link as would be readily understood by a worker skilled in the art. The apparatus illustrated in operates similarly to the apparatus except that some functionalities are centralized at a remote server . The server may be operatively coupled to plural terminals at plural locations so that the service may be offered at different locations.

Embodiments of the present subject matter may comprise functional equivalents of the apparatus as illustrated in or C. For example embodiments may comprise plural computer devices each comprising one or more of a payment module a monitoring module and an interface module along with appropriate interfaces and data storage. The plural computer devices may be configured to communicate with each other and cooperate so as to provide operation of an apparatus in accordance with the present subject matter.

In some embodiments a monitored database or registry which includes information regarding wireless devices foreign to the operator network may be a visitor location register VLR or the like. As would be readily understood by a worker skilled in the art a VLR facilitates roaming agreements by tracking foreign wireless devices currently visiting an operator network. Another registry or database which may include information regarding wireless devices foreign to the operator network may be one associated with a RADIUS server.

In an example scenario in accordance with embodiments of the present subject matter a wireless device initially connects to the foreign operator network upon arrival or power on. This connection may be facilitated by existing roaming methods which utilize identity information already stored in the wireless device. The user is subsequently presented with an offer to connect to the foreign network using local identity information downloaded from a pool of local identities. The offer may be presented via a kiosk for example. The pool of local identities which in some embodiments may be referred to as virtual UICC identities may be provided by the foreign operator network. Usage of a local identity represented by respective local identity information may be monitored and billed to the wireless device or user thereof using a payment method such as PayPal or Visa. A variety of different payment offers for different amounts of data and periods of time could be offered for the user to select from. A billing event may be triggered automatically for example periodically upon predetermined billing amounts being reached upon completion of temporary use of the local identity or the like or a combination thereof.

In some embodiments a foreign device may be a wireless device primarily serviced by another service provider covering the same geographical area territory or country as the foreign operator network. This may provide wireless device users with an option to purchase service at a competitive rate.

In some embodiments the user may have an option to initiate providing of services by visiting a kiosk telephoning an operator or representative of a service provider offering said services sending an email text or SMS message or by accessing a website. The user may thus initiate the step of identifying the wireless device as being foreign to the operator network through such an action and identifying wireless devices as foreign to the operator network may comprise monitoring for user generated requests for service. Such actions may be performed by the wireless device for example by using the network of another service provider or using a roaming data service.

In some embodiments temporary permanent or quasi permanent use of local identities is administered by an operator or service provider to which those identities are registered and local. Administration may be performed by the operator or service provider independently by a separate business or in co operation with the one or more other service providers that could have negotiated a group rate. In some embodiments a separate business may be able to offer services in co operation with a plurality of service providers. For example a business may allow wireless device users to sign up for a global roaming package or one that bundles predetermined services for selected countries or regions and or service providers of interest. This approach enables such a business to offer the convenience of a single invoice to a user for all roaming service.

In some embodiments to enhance security the provided identity information representative of a specified local identity may be protected from duplication or tampering. For example a token system may be implemented to allow an identity to be used only by one wireless device at a given time. For example before an identity is lent out for temporary permanent or quasi permanent use by a wireless device the wireless device or user thereof may be required to provide an authenticated token indicative of its permanent identity. In some embodiments the token may be strongly associated with the wireless device s home identity information. That is the wireless device may be required to communicate its home identity information in order to receive the local identity information.

In some embodiments plural identities are stored in a database and transferred as needed to wireless devices for use thereby. Prior to transferring the method apparatus and computer program product according to embodiments of the present subject matter may be configured to obtain information indicative of a permanent identity of the wireless device or user thereof and or payment information for use in recovering payment related to use of the identity information by the wireless device in accordance with a predetermined service agreement. For example after an initial user dialog in which the user agrees to subscribe to a service offering the identity the wireless device may transmit based on the user s input and or authorization permanent identity information and or payment information. Permanent identity information may include a permanent telephone number IMSI IMEI ESN MEID MSISDN user name user address or the like. Payment information may include a credit card number Paypal account number bank account number escrow service account number proof of prepayment acceptable promise to pay or the like.

In some embodiments a kiosk may display a welcome message to wireless device users upon their entry to a new roaming service area containing a foreign operator network. To facilitate this the kiosks may be appropriately placed at airports train stations border crossings or the like. The welcome message may be interactive and may include an option to either continue to connect to the foreign operator network in a conventional manner for example roaming or to connect using local identity information representative of a respective local identity thereby operating as equivalent to a local device relative to the foreign network. In some embodiments release of the local identity may be automatic upon departure from the foreign operator s area of coverage triggered for example by a predetermined timeout removal of the wireless device from an operator registry or the like. In some embodiments release of the local identity may be user initiated for example by sending a message voice message email text message or the like to a predetermined automated recipient or by visiting a kiosk and selecting an option to release that specific local identity.

In embodiments of the present subject matter the wireless device upon obtaining and installing the local identity information indicative of a respective local identity becomes equivalent to a device holding a valid local subscription to services of the operator network. Billing is therefore managed by the operator network and or a business entity to which the local identity is registered.

A potential advantage of embodiments of the present subject matter is that it may be used to reduce or eliminate the practice of backhauling the user s data to the user s home country in order for billing to be managed by their home service providers.

Another potential advantage of embodiments of the present subject matter is that it may be used to reduce or eliminate the need to carry multiple UICCs or other smart cards when traveling and to physically change cards. This is particularly problematic when UICC or other identity electronics are built into a wireless device or when a wireless device is locked to a particular UICC.

In some embodiments the present subject matter may be used to enable a wireless device to operate as equivalent to a local subscriber for use of voice services data services or both. When the wireless device operates as a local subscriber equivalent in terms of voice services it may receive a local telephone number. In some embodiments a wireless device may be configured to use its permanent identity information for voice services and its local identity information for data services or vice versa. A wireless device may thus be configured to run multiple concurrent SIM applications or the like. In some embodiments a wireless device may be configured to operate concurrently as both a roaming device and a local equivalent device by virtue of multiple concurrent operating SIM or like applications. In this case the wireless device may be configured with prioritization rules to determine which identity to use for outgoing voice calls and or outgoing data transmissions.

Local identity information may be used temporarily permanently or quasi permanently by the wireless device to operate as equivalent to a local subscriber. For example the local identity information may be used for providing or modifying an application such as a SIM USIM CSIM application or the like running on the wireless device or smart card such as a UICC thereof. The local identity information may comprise executable code for example corresponding to an executable SIM USIM or CSIM application or a portion thereof source code or other information for use in creating and or compiling appropriate executable code data fields usable to modify an existing application or executable code thereof or the like or a combination thereof. In some embodiments local identity information may comprise an applet file or the like wirelessly communicated to the wireless device and implemented thereon as described for example in ETSI TS 102 240 v6.0.0 Technical Specification Smart Cards UICC Application Programming Interface and Loader Requirements Service Description Release 6 European Telecommunications Standards Institute 2002.

For example in some embodiments the local identity information comprises code of a SIM application which may be downloaded installed and executed by a UICC of the wireless device. The SIM application may contain local identity information such as a serial number IMSI authentication and ciphering information passwords list of authorized services network information and the like. This information is configured to be recognized by the operator network as belonging to a local subscriber thereof. All or a portion of the information may be pre registered with the operator network to this end.

Local identity information for use by a wireless device to configure compile and or execute an identity application such as a SIM application may be transferred and implemented in various ways. In some embodiments the identity application may be stored and or executed on a smart card off a smart card or a combination thereof. In some embodiments the identity application may be executed on a smart card emulator running on the wireless device. Various methods of programming providing and executing secure or unsecure smart card applications may be used as would be readily understood by a worker skilled in the art.

In some embodiments a wireless device may be configured to concurrently hold its own previous identity information as well as the local identity information obtained in accordance with the present subject matter. For example the wireless device may operate plural applications such as SIM applications concurrently on a UICC thereof one for its own permanent identity and one for its newly assumed possibly temporary local identity. In some embodiments this may enable the wireless device to at least receive calls and data addressed to either the permanent or new local identity while preferably using the new identity to send data.

In some embodiments the present subject matter may be used in conjunction with Mobile IP or other data forwarding methods to allow the wireless device to retain at least a portion of its connectivity of its permanent identity while taking advantage of efficiency and economy of its new local identity.

In some embodiments multiple identities including one or more local identities each represented by specified local identity information may be stored in wireless device memory for example within a UICC card. Rather than lose the normal home identity when taking on a new one the new local identity for use while visiting a different country or location may be added to a range of available identities for the user to select at will. Available identities may be selected via a pre existing functionality of the wireless device for example. In some embodiments the user may be able to set rules for selection of the various identities based on criteria such as location time of day and service provider or the like or a combination thereof. Embodiments of the present subject matter may provide for an application for applying pre defined and or user defined rule sets for identity selection.

In some embodiments identities conferred upon a wireless device by way of the present subject matter may be optionally released deleted or kept indefinitely. The charge for keeping an identity indefinitely may be nominally higher however not prohibitively high. A dormant identity held by the wireless device but not used for a long period of time may incur no additional charges or a nominal additional charge.

In some embodiments a permanent that is unchanging and unchangeable identity is stored in the array of available identities. The permanent identity may serve for example together with the ICCID of the wireless device as a means to uniquely identify the device and possibly to control or curtail usage in case the device is stolen. This may help prevent undesired use of the present technology by persons wishing to continue using stolen wireless devices with a new local identity.

Local identity information representative of a local identity provided to the wireless device via the short range wireless communication module may be stored in memory of the wireless device and or memory of the UICC . The CPU of the wireless device may execute instructions for configuring and storing the local identity information as may the microprocessor and or crypto processor . In some embodiments the local identity information is used to configure a program or application which is stored in memory and executed by one or more of the CPU the microprocessor and the crypto processor . The program or application may be a SIM USIM CSIM or other application for example. The program may be stored and executed at least in part by the UICC . The program may alternatively be stored and executed by the wireless device .
