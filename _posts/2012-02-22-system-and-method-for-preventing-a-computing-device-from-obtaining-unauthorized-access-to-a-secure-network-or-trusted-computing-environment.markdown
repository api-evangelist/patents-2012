title: System and method for preventing a computing device from obtaining unauthorized access to a secure network or trusted computing environment
abstract: A system for preventing a computing device from obtaining unauthorized access to a secure network includes a client agent operably connected to the computing device configured to intercept network traffic information from applications running on the computing device and transmit a network request including application information and the network traffic information. A network token broker operably connected to the network client agent contains a database of application information. The network token broker is configured to cooperate with the network client agent for i) verifying whether the network request should be granted access to the secure network, and ii) cryptographically signing the intercepted network traffic information with a network authorization token, to authorize network access for the intercepted network traffic information. A guard system is configured to inspect the network traffic information from the computing device and reject any traffic information not signed with the network authorization token.

The present invention relates generally to communication networks and more particularly to an enhanced system for protecting communication networks from an unauthorized computer user.

Sophisticated attacks against computer systems are increasing dramatically. These attacks become even more problematic with the increased functionality of various communication devices including cell phones. For example when trying to provide trusted functionality to cell phones utilizing sleeves there is a growing need to determine 1 if the software on the phone is supposed to communicate with the sleeve 2 if the software has been corrupted and 3 if the appropriate phone is paired with the sleeve. It is extremely difficult to guard a system against these attacks. Many attacks now utilize zero day unknown before hand attack factors that are not recognized by virus scanners. Attacks often combine highly sophisticated social engineering and custom exploits to induce victims to load malicious software. These custom exploits are not recognized by available anti virus anti spyware systems. Subverted machines use standard mechanisms to leak information. Exploits use standard protocols e.g. HTTP to transmit information with network traffic indistinguishable from legitimate traffic or concealed within an encrypted transport e.g. HTTPS .

U.S. Publicn. No. 2005 0262558 entitled ON LINE CENTRALIZED AND LOCAL AUTHORIZATION OF EXECUTABLE FILES discloses a system and method for controlling the execution of executable files. The executables are identified by either a cryptographic digest or a digital certificate. The cryptographic digest is computed from the binary image of the executable. An executable that is attempting to execute is intercepted by a protection module that consults a database of stored rules over a secure channel to determine whether or not the executable can be identified as a permitted executable and whether or not it has permission to execute on a particular computer system under certain specified conditions. If a stored permission is available it is used to control the execution. Otherwise the user is consulted for permission.

U.S. Publicn. No. 2010 0077445 entitled GRADUATED ENFORCEMENT OF RESTRICTIONS ACCORDING TO AN APPLICATION S REPUTATION discloses security software on a client that observes a request for a resource from an application on the client and then determines the application s reputation. The application s reputation may be measured by a reputation score obtained from a remote reputation server. The security software determines an access policy from a graduated set of possible access policies for the application based on the application s reputation. The security software applies the access policy to the application s request for the resource. In this way the reputation based system uses a graduated trust scale and a policy enforcement mechanism that restricts or grants application functionality for resource interactivity along a graduated scale.

The Kerberos consortium provides technology that allows for strong authentication in open distributed networks providing a single mechanism for authentication of users and services. While Kerberos provides authentication services in the context of an untrusted network environment it does not provide authentication of untrusted processes and devices to a trusted network or service. Nor is it designed to work in context of a high assurance guard separating untrusted from trusted environments.

In a broad aspect the present invention is a system for preventing a computing device from obtaining unauthorized access to a secure network. A network client agent is operably connected to the computing device and is configured to intercept network traffic information from applications running on the computing device and transmit a network request comprising application information and the network traffic information. A network token broker is operably connected to the network client agent and contains a database of application information. The network token broker is configured to cooperate with the network client agent for i verifying whether the network request should be granted access to the secure network and ii cryptographically signing the intercepted network traffic information with a network authorization token to authorize network access for the intercepted network traffic information. A guard system is operably connected to the computing device and the network client agent. It is configured to inspect the network traffic information from the computing device and reject any traffic information not signed with the network authorization token.

The computing device may be for example a smart cell phone laptop computer computer pad or other device that facilitates access to a remote network. The network token broker and the guard system may be embodied within a communication sleeve constructed to attach to the computing device. Use of a sleeve and applying the hardened proxy internet protocol IP provides the ability to provide access for a generally untrusted computing device e.g. smart phone to a secure network. The hardened proxy IP enables determination if the software has been corrupted whether only approved software is attempting to communicate with the secure network and that the appropriate phone is installed paired with the sleeve.

US 2005 0262558 discussed above involves use of file hashes to decide whether to allow an executable program to launch. It is a host based system. The present invention on the other hand does not prevent launching of an executable program. The present invention controls access to a network or trusted computing environment.

The present invention prevents applications from connecting to the outside world by adding device level and process level authentication and authorization to network traffic.

In addition to preventing a computing device from obtaining unauthorized access to a secure network the inventive concepts herein can be extended to authenticating a request from an untrusted computing device to access an interface for service functions in a trusted computing environment. In such a system a service client agent operably connected to an untrusted computing device is configured to present identity recognition credentials and unique hardware identifiers with service requests from service applications to access an interface to service functions in a trusted computing environment. A service token broker is contained in the trusted computing environment and is operably connected to the service client agent. It contains a database of identifying credentials and unique hardware identifiers. It is configured to cooperate with the service client agent for i verifying whether the service requests should have access to the trusted computing environment and ii cryptographically signing the service requests with a service authorization token to authorize access for the service functions. A service interface in a trusted computing environment is operably connected to the service client agent and is configured to inspect the service requests from the untrusted computing device and reject any service requests not signed with the service authorization token.

Referring now to the drawings and the characters of reference marked thereon illustrates a first embodiment of the system for preventing a computing device from obtaining unauthorized access to a secure network of the present invention designated generally as . The system includes a network client agent a network token broker and a guard system . The network client agent is operably connected to a computing device and is configured to intercept network traffic information from the applications running on the computing device and transmit a network request comprising application information of the network traffic information. The network token broker is operably connected to network client agent and contains a database of application information. The network token broker is configured to cooperate with the network client agent for i verifying whether the network request should be granted access to the secure network and ii cryptographically signing the intercepted network traffic information with a network authorization token to authorize network access for the intercepted network traffic information. The guard system is operably connected to the computing device . The guard system is also operably connected to either the network client agent or the network token broker and is configured to inspect the network traffic information from the computing device and reject any traffic information not signed with the network authorization token.

The computing device may be for example a type of smart cell phone laptop computer computer pad etc. The network client agent may be a software component generally running on the computing device or alternately may be a firmware function implemented in computing device hardware. The network token broker and the guard system may be embodied within a communication sleeve constructed to attach to the computing device . The communication sleeve may include for example any number of casings for example protective enclosures charging or docking cradles surplus batteries antenna extenders mounting brackets or peripheral components for protecting and holding the computing device or extending its functionality. The network token broker can be implemented as a software component running on the communication sleeve or as a firmware component in communication sleeve hardware. The guard system can be implemented as a high assurance network guard system providing strict isolation between the secure network and the computing device . Or the guard system can be implemented as a software component providing functionality similar to a commercially available firewall proxy system a standalone software component running on a computer server or a standalone specialized computer system. The guard system preferably includes an egress guard and an ingress guard . The network client agent may be incorporated into the computing device or may be embodied as a specialized item of computer hardware. Thus the phrase that the network client agent is operably connected to the computing device is deemed to be broadly construed to encompass both potential scenarios.

The network client agent network token broker may provide the cryptographic signing by signing individual network packets. This may be provided by for example applying internet protocol IP encapsulation by adding a cryptographic hash field to the intercepted network traffic information. Alternatively it may be accomplished by applying an Internet Protocol header field such as an IPv4 header option field or IPv6 header chain field to the intercepted network traffic information. Or such a signing may be accomplished by applying a transport layer wrapping protocol to the intercepted network traffic information.

The network token broker may provide the cryptographic signing by adding a token. This may be by adding a tag value pair to an application layer protocol.

Alternatively the network token broker may provide the cryptographic signing by a decision making technique. Referring now to an example decision making technique designated generally as may be as follows 

a receiving cryptographic signatures of the application information and the network traffic information to provide received cryptographic signature and network traffic information process block 

b identifying the application information authentication or host machine authentication of the received network traffic information and the received cryptographic signature to provide identified intercepted network information and cryptographic signature process block 

c computing a cryptographic signature of the identified traffic information including user authentication and user host OS configuration to provide computed cryptographic hash of the identified traffic information process block 

d comparing the computed network traffic information and the cryptographic signature against a whitelist and or a blacklist database or comparing intercepted network information against whitelist or blacklist database to provide compared computed networked information and compared computed cryptographic signature process block and 

e digitally signing the network traffic information only if the compared computed network information and compared computed cryptographic signature are contained in the whitelist and not contained in the blacklist process block .

Referring now to the network client agent may provide monitoring of the network traffic information by the following process designated generally as 

a intercepting the transmit network request or the network traffic information to provide the intercepted transmit network request or the network traffic information process block 

b identifying the application information of the intercepted network request or the network traffic information to provide identified application information process block 

c forwarding the intercepted transmit network request or the network traffic information with the computed cryptographic hash of the identified application information to the network token broker process block .

The guard system of the present invention is designed to properly cooperate with the type of network client agent used. For example if individual network packets are signed by i applying internet protocol IP encapsulation by adding a cryptographic hash field to the intercepted network traffic information or ii by applying an IPv4 header option field or IPv6 header chain field to the intercepted network traffic information then the guard system may provide inspection of the network traffic information by the process of 

a receiving the cryptographically signed network traffic information from either the network client agent or the network token broker 

c stripping the signature to restore the request to provide original state prior to interception by the network client agent and

d forwarding the original intercepted network traffic information to a secure network destination only if the signature is valid.

If the network token broker provides the cryptographic signing by signing individual network packets by applying a transport layer wrapping protocol to the intercepted network traffic information then the guard system may operate as follows 

c stripping the token to restore the application layer request to provide the original state prior to interception by the network client agent and

d forwarding the original intercepted network traffic information to a secure network destination only if the signature is valid.

Referring now to a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated generally as . In this embodiment the invention is embodied as a system for authenticating a request from an untrusted computing device to access a service interface for service functions in a trusted computing environment . The system includes a service client agent a service token broker and a service interface . The service client agent is operably connected to the untrusted computing device and is configured to present identity recognition credentials with service requests from service applications to access the service interface to service functions in the trusted computing environment . A trusted computing environment is characterized by an assumption of integrity of computing functions software and information based on prior analysis and development pedigree. An untrusted computing environment is characterized by assumption that computing functions and software are potentially compromised or erroneous and information is potentially incorrect or falsified. The service token broker is contained in the trusted computing environment . It is operably connected to the service client agent and contains a database of identity recognition credentials.

The service token broker is configured to cooperate with the service client agent for i verifying whether the service requests should have access to the trusted computing environment and ii cryptographically signing the service requests with a service authorization token to authorize access for the services or functions. The identity recognition credentials include at a minimum unique hardware identifiers but may also include software identifiers and hashes user identification credentials etc. The trusted computing environment may be embodied as a communications sleeve as described with reference to the first embodiment discussed above.

The service interface is operably connected to the untrusted computing device and the service client agent . The service interface is configured to inspect the service requests from the service application and reject any service requests not signed with the service authorization token.

As discussed above with respect to the first embodiment the computing device may be for example a type of smart cell phone laptop computer computer pad etc. The service client agent may be a software component generally running on the computing device or alternately may be a firmware function implemented in computing device hardware. The service token broker and the service interface may be embodied within a communication sleeve constructed to attach to the computing device . The communication sleeve may include for example any number of casings for example protective enclosures charging or docking cradles surplus batteries antenna extenders mounting brackets or peripheral components for protecting and holding the computing device or extending its functionality. The service token broker can be implemented as a software component running on the communication sleeve or as a firmware component in communication sleeve hardware. The service interface can be implemented as a high assurance network guard system providing strict isolation between the secure network and the computing device . Or the service interface can be implemented as a software component providing functionality similar to a commercially available firewall proxy system a standalone software component running on a computer server or a standalone specialized computer system. The service client agent may be incorporated into the computing device or may be embodied as a specialized item of computer hardware. Thus the phrase that the service client agent is operably connected to the computing device is deemed to be broadly construed to encompass both potential scenarios.

The service token broker may provide the cryptographic signing by signing individual network packets.

Alternatively the service token broker may provide the cryptographic signing by a decision making technique. An example decision making technique may be as follows 

a receiving the identity recognition credentials and service request information from the service requests to provide the received identity recognition credentials and the service request information 

b identifying the identity recognition credentials and the received service request information to provide identified service request information and identified identity recognition credentials 

c computing a cryptographic signature of the identified service request information including the identified identity recognition credentials to provide a computed cryptographic hash of the identified service request information 

d comparing the computed service request information and the computed cryptographic signature against a whitelist and or a blacklist database or comparing the service request information against a whitelist or blacklist database to provide compared computed service request information and compared computed cryptographic signature and 

e digitally signing the service request information only if the compared computed service request information and compared computed cryptographic signature are contained in the whitelist and not contained in the blacklist.

The service interface of the present invention is designed to properly cooperate with the type of service client agent used. For example if individual network packets are signed by i applying internet protocol IP encapsulation by adding a cryptographic hash field to the intercepted network traffic information or ii by applying an IPv4 header option field or IPv6 header chain field to the intercepted network traffic information then the service interface may provide inspection of the network traffic information by the process of 

b testing the validity of the cryptographic signature to provide validated cryptographic signature and 

Other embodiments and configurations may be devised without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
