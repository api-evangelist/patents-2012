With the advent of the internet and portable computing devices information can be accessed easily and quickly from anywhere. Users can access reports such as business intelligence reports from anywhere and at any time over wireless communication networks. Some reports may include sensitive data. Accessing such reports from public places may not be secure and users may be asked not to open such records in public. Asking users not to open the reports is not an effective or a reliable approach for protecting sensitive data. Some security measures involve restricting the access of reports in public places. Restricting the access of report can be unproductive in situations where users need to immediately work on the report from some public place. Other security measures involve password protection where users are required to enter a password before opening the reports with sensitive data. However password protection is also not effective because once the report is opened the sensitive data is exposed.

Embodiments of techniques for visual securement of sensitive data are described herein. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment this embodiment and similar phrases means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

Report may be a document which presents information to a specific audience. For example a business intelligence BI report presents salient content to business users such as business analysts. The report can include tables charts graphical elements etc. In one embodiment the report is a graphical report including one or more graphs. In one embodiment the report is a tabular report comprising one or more data fields. For example the tabular report employee profile may include data fields such as employee name address salary etc. Each data field of the report includes one or more data or values. For example the data field employee name includes data e.g. Alex Tom Rim etc.

Critical or sensitive data fields are those data fields of the report which can be of more interest to a user or otherwise emphasized. What is sensitive may vary depending on the context. In one context the data fields which are more frequently analyzed in the report may be sensitive. In one embodiment the data fields including personal information may be sensitive. In some embodiments the sensitive data fields are predefined at design time i.e. during a design or development phase of the report. Usually a report designer specifies the sensitive data fields. For example the report designer may specify the data field employee name as sensitive data field. In one embodiment the data fields are specified sensitive at runtime by a user. In one embodiment the data fields are automatically specified sensitive based upon user s behavior. In one embodiment the data fields are specified sensitive by recording those data fields which are more frequently accessed by the user. In one embodiment an access count of the data field is recorded and if the access count exceeds a predefined number the data field is automatically specified as the sensitive data field.

Sensitive data are parts of the report which are important and subject to privacy. In one embodiment the sensitive data are data associated with the sensitive data fields. For example the data such as Alex Tom Rim etc. of the sensitive data field employee name are automatically marked as sensitive data. In some embodiments each data is individually specified as sensitive or non sensitive at design time of the report. For example the data related to personal information of a particular user may be specified as sensitive data at design time of the report.

The data corresponding to the sensitive data fields automatically becomes sensitive data. For example the data E1 E5 related to the sensitive data field S1 the data U1 U5 related to the sensitive data field S2 the data V1 V5 related to the sensitive data field S3 and the data W1 W5 related to the sensitive data field S4 automatically becomes sensitive data. In one embodiment each specific data e.g. E1 can be independently configured as sensitive or non sensitive.

Referring to a request for displaying the report e.g. the graphical report or the tabular report may be received from a portable computing device . The end user can send the request from anywhere using the portable computing device . For example the end user may send the request from his mobile phone from any public place such as airport railway station market place bus stand etc. The portable computing device may be any computing device which can be carried by the end user e.g. a laptop a mobile phone a smartphone a tablet computer etc. The end user sends the request for displaying the report e.g. the report from the portable computing device . The request is received by a report rendering module . The report rendering module is communicatively coupled to the portable computing device . In one embodiment the report rendering module may be a part of the portable computing device .

Once the request is received by the report rendering module the report rendering module looks for the requested report e.g. the report on a server shown in . The report rendering module is communicatively coupled to the server that stores the reports. In one embodiment the server may be a business intelligence BI server. In one embodiment the report rendering module may be a part of the server . The report rendering module communicates with the server to check the availability of requested report e.g. the report .

In one embodiment when the requested report is not available on the server the report rendering module displays an error message on the portable computing device . Few exemplary error messages may be not available error. unidentified report etc. In case the requested report e.g. the report is available on the server the report rendering module generates an instance of the requested report . In one embodiment the report rendering module includes the securement module . The securement module determines if the requested report includes any sensitive data. In one embodiment the securement module determines if the requested report includes any sensitive data by determining if the requested report includes any sensitive data fields. In one embodiment the securement module refers to report definition to determine whether the report includes any sensitive data field. Typically the securement module determines whether the property named IS SENSITIVE for any data field is TRUE. If the property IS SENSITIVE for any data field is TRUE it is determined that the report includes sensitive data field. By default the property IS SENSITIVE for all the data fields is set FALSE. At design time of the report the property IS SENSITIVE may be set TRUE for the sensitive data fields S1 S4.

Once it is determined that the report includes sensitive data fields S1 S4 the securement module identifies the display rule associated with the sensitive data fields S1 S4. In one embodiment the display rule is predefined for each of the sensitive data fields S1 S4. The display rule is related to visual securement of the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 of the sensitive data fields S1 S4. In one embodiment a separate display rule may be defined for each sensitive data field S1 S4. The display rule may be predefined at design time of the report . In one embodiment the display rule may be revised or updated. The display rule associated with the sensitive data fields S1 S4 is for obscuring their respective data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5. In one embodiment the display rule executes a procedure for obscuring the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5.

In one embodiment the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 is obscured in the instance of the report generated by the report rendering module . The securement module applies the display rule on the instance of the report and not on the actual report which is stored on the server .

In one embodiment the procedure for obscuring the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 includes blurring or smudging the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 as shown in . The sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 may be blurred using any suitable blurring or smudging algorithm known in the art to generate a visually secured report . For example a Gaussian image blur algorithm may be used to blur the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5. As shown in the visually secured report includes unobscured non sensitive data fields NS1 NSN and the obscured sensitive data fields S1 S4.

In one embodiment the procedure for obscuring sensitive data includes adjusting contrast of the sensitive data. illustrates a visually secured report including the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 with adjusted contrast. The contrast is a difference in luminance and or color of a displayed data and a background. In one embodiment the contrast is adjusted by adjusting a color of the sensitive data relative to the background color. In one embodiment the contrast is adjusted by adjusting the background color relative to the color of the sensitive data. In one embodiment both the color of the sensitive data and the background color are adjusted relative to each other. The background color may be represented as bgc and the color of the sensitive data may be represented as tc. In some embodiments the below exemplary algorithm may be executed to adjust the contrast of the sensitive data 

According to the above algorithm it is determined if the color of the sensitive data tc has a default value e.g. BLACK or 000000 in hexadecimal format . If the color of the sensitive data tc is equal to 000000 it implies that the sensitive data has a default color e.g. BLACK . The color of the sensitive data then can be changed relative to the color of the background to obscure the sensitive data. In one embodiment the color of the sensitive data tc is changed to the background color some small value e.g. tc bgc . In one embodiment the color of the sensitive data tc is changed to the background color some small value e.g. tc bgc . In one embodiment the may be any suitable hexadecimal value which ensures small difference between the color of the sensitive data and the background color such as 111111 112233 221133 113333 222222 etc. For example the text E1 E5. U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 is changed to background color i.e. white small value and therefore the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 appears slightest grayish and obscured in . In case the color of the sensitive data tc is not default color or BLACK then the color of the sensitive data might be context specific e.g. RED color to identify that the data requires attention. The color of the context specific data should not be changed. In case the color of the sensitive data tc BLACK the background color bgc is changed relative to the color of the sensitive data to obscure the sensitive data. For example the background color bgc is changed to the color of the sensitive data some small value e.g. bgc tc . Therefore actual values of color of the sensitive data and the background color are adjusted appropriately to render the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 difficult to read thereby protecting the data from prying eyes and cameras etc. The above stated algorithm is for illustration and any suitable algorithm for adjusting contrast may be used.

In one embodiment the contrast may be adjusted by adjusting an alpha value of the color of the sensitive data or the background color. The alpha value represents opacity and the alpha value varies from 0 to 1 i.e. 0 1. The alpha value 0 represents 100 transparency i.e. text becomes transparent and invisible. The alpha value 1 represents 0 transparency i.e. text becomes opaque and clearly visible. By default the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data is 1 and therefore the text is clearly visible. For obscuring text the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data may be adjusted so that the text becomes more transparent and obscured. The alpha value of the color of the sensitive data may be adjusted by calling a function tc tc.alpha . For example the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data may be adjusted by calling a function tc tc.alpha 0.03 . In some embodiments the contrast is adjusted by just adjusting the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data. In some embodiments the contrast is adjusted by adjusting the color of the sensitive data e.g. tc bgc followed by adjusting the alpha value of the color of the sensitive data.

In one embodiment the procedure for obscuring the sensitive data includes striking out the sensitive data. In one embodiment the font effect strikethrough or double strikethrough is automatically enabled for the sensitive data. illustrates a visually secured report including the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 being obscured using strikethrough.

In one embodiment the procedure for obscuring sensitive data includes reducing font size of the sensitive data. In one embodiment the font size for the sensitive data is automatically set to certain predefined value. illustrates a visually secured report with the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 being obscured by reducing font size.

In one embodiment the procedure for obscuring sensitive data includes masking the sensitive data. In one embodiment masking includes applying a dark layer e.g. BLACK patch upon the sensitive data. illustrates a visually secured report including sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 masked with the dark layer. In one embodiment the dark layer may be applied by calculating a display area covering the sensitive data. For example the respective display area covering the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 may be calculated. Once the display area of the respective sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 is calculated the respective display area may be filled by dark color like BLACK. In one embodiment the color of the display area may be set as displayarea.color 000000. In one embodiment a single display area covering all the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 may be calculated and masked with the BLACK patch.

Although some procedures for obscuring sensitive data are described above it should be understood that other obscuring procedures can be easily adopted. Any new procedure for obscuring data may be easily configured within the securement module .

In one embodiment the display rule calls the procedure for obscuring the sensitive data E1 E5 U1 U5 V1 V5 and W1 W5 based upon various conditional parameters. In one embodiment the conditional parameter includes at least one of the location information of the portable computing device from which the request for displaying the report is received a name or an address of a network through which the request is received a connectivity status of the network including an online and offline status of the network an authentication information of the end user sending the request an email address of the end user to whom the report or an screen shot of the report is to be sent etc.

Examples of display rules for obscuring the sensitive data based on the location information includes a blur sensitive data when location of portable device accessing the report is greater than 2 miles radius from place named XYZ b blur sensitive data when location of portable device accessing the report is greater than 2 miles radius from place address ABC c blur sensitive data when location of portable device accessing the report does not has the latitude longitude value of L1 L2. L1 and L2 can have any suitable numerical value. In one embodiment various known techniques such as global positioning system GPS radio frequency identifier RFID geo coding cell tower location etc. may be used for determining the location information.

In one embodiment the display rule including conditional parameter related to the location information may be strikethrough the sensitive data when employee is not in office. In one embodiment it may be determined whether the employee is within the office campus or outside based upon the employee entry exit information. Typically a database table IN OUT register shown below as Table 1 may be maintained for tracking employee entry exit details 

In one embodiment the report rendering module can query a server not shown storing Table 1 whether the employee is IN or OUT. For example the report rendering module queries the server is I089 IN The server checks Table 1 IN OUT register and replies back. If the reply is YES then the employee is within the office campus and therefore according to the display rule the report is displayed without striking the sensitive data.

Examples of display rules for obscuring the sensitive data based on the network information such as the address and the status of the network includes a blur sensitive data when network through which request is received is a wireless network unless the name of the wireless network is abc b blur sensitive data when the network address through which request is received is not yz c strikethrough sensitive data when connectivity status of the network is offline d blur sensitive data until SSID is pqr . SSID or service set identifier is a name of a wireless local area network WLAN . The display rule strikethrough sensitive data when connectivity status of the network is offline is applicable for the already downloaded reports.

In one embodiment the display rule can be based on the authentication information of the end user or the device. Non authenticated users or devices may not be allowed to view the reports from the server . An exemplary display rule including conditional parameter based on the user authentication information may be as blur sensitive data when the user is not authenticated. 

In one embodiment the display rule can be based on an email address or email id of a receiver. For example the display rule may be blur sensitive data if the report is sent to an unknown email id. In one embodiment a screen shot of the report may be sent via email. The securement module determines if the email id is known or registered. In case the email id is not registered the font size of the sensitive data is automatically reduced in the screenshot to be sent to the unregistered email id. In one embodiment the display rule for obscuring sensitive data may be applied while sharing the report via social networking sites e.g. Facebook Twitter etc.

In one embodiment the display rule may be overruled based upon some exceptions. For example if the user accessing the report is granted special permission or privileges then the display rule may be overruled and the sensitive data is not obscured for the user. The special privileges may be associated with a profile or device of the user. The securement module determines if the special privilege is associated with the user. In one embodiment the securement module determines if the device from which the report is requested is given special privileges. In case the special privilege is associated with the user or device the display rule is overruled and the sensitive data is not obscured.

In one embodiment as illustrated in a user interface element is provided on a screen or a user interface of the portable computing device to enable users view the obscured data. In one embodiment the UI element may be a magnifier glass kind of element. The UI element is navigable and the user can position the UI element anywhere on the screen. The area under the UI element becomes clearly visible. Therefore when the user positions the UI element upon e.g. a part of the obscured data that part of the obscured data becomes clearly visible. For example the data E5 positioned under the UI element become clearly visible. Therefore the end user can view the obscured data without straining themselves. In one embodiment the UI element can be of any other shape or size.

In one embodiment information or reasons for obscuring the sensitive data may also be displayed. The information for obscuring the sensitive data may be displayed in response to the user action such as on placing a cursor upon the obscured data. In one embodiment as shown in the information for obscuring the sensitive data is displayed within an information bar positioned at the top of the visually secured report.

In one embodiment the display rule for obscuring the sensitive data of the report is automatically applied on the report before the screenshot of the report is taken.

An operating system OS of mobile devices like smartphone takes screenshot of the report while minimizing or closing the report. Typically a function e.g. applicationwillgotobackground is automatically called while closing or minimizing the report. Once the function is called the OS knows that the report is to be closed or minimized going to background . After the execution of the function applicationwillgotobackground the OS takes screenshot of the report and saves it in a backend. The screenshots from the backend can be easily retrieved by hackers. Generally even if the mobile device is locked a hacker can easily retrieve the stored screenshots e.g. using a pen drive. Therefore it is required to obscure the sensitive data in the screenshot. In one embodiment a code for obscuring sensitive data of the displayed report is included within the function applicationwillgotobackground . Therefore whenever the function applicationwillgotobackground is called and executed the sensitive data of report is obscured and the visually secured report is displayed on the screen. The OS then takes the screenshot of the visually secured report. The screenshot of the visually secured report is then saved in the backend.

Embodiments described above enable visual securement of sensitive data within reports. Sensitive data within reports are visually secured e.g. obscured without hampering the accessibility of the reports. Therefore users can access and work on the report without bothering about the security of the sensitive data. The sensitive data is automatically obscured using various techniques such as blurring smudging adjusting contrast striking out reducing font size masking the sensitive data with a dark layer etc. Embodiments are also flexible to incorporate new techniques of obscuring data. In some embodiment sensitive data is visually secured depending upon various conditional parameters. In some embodiments a magnifier glass kind of UI element is provided to enable users view the obscured data. The user can position the UI element upon the obscured data which becomes clearly visible and the user can easily view the obscured data without straining themselves.

Some embodiments may include the above described methods being written as one or more software components. These components and the functionality associated with each may be used by client server distributed or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as functional declarative procedural object oriented lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively the components maybe implemented in server and client applications. Further these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing an interface level e.g. a graphical user interface . These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server client peer to peer or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.
