This document relates to systems and techniques for presenting events to a user of a mobile device such as a smartphone.

More and more people are on the run using mobile communication devices to keep communicating. From mobile devices people make and receive telephone calls send and receive electronic mail surf the web and text with various friends and acquaintances.

When messages come in or when other events occur on a mobile device it is customary for the device to make a noise signaling the event. Such an action derives from traditional telephones which rang and still ring a bell when someone is calling. Such ringtones can now be customized depending on the identity of the caller for the incoming call. Also a device may be switched to vibrate mode when silence is golden such as at a meeting a movie or a play. For other sorts of incoming messages such as e mails or for other events the device may beep vibrate or provide some other form of alert.

This document describes systems and techniques that may be used to alert a user of a mobile device about an event such as about the presence of a recently received message e.g. an e mail voice mail or text message or other form of event such as a change in song on a music player running in a background state. In general when a message is first received or another event is triggered a portion of the message may be provided in an area that is outside the main area of a mobile device display such as by scrolling information about the message through a traditional status bar area of the device. A status bar area is the typically static area on a device that displays information such as bars for wireless signal strength a remaining battery life indicator an icon that shows the network over which wireless communication is occurring and the like. The main area or zone of the display is generally the central largest area of a display where active programs are displayed while supplemental elements are typically displayed around the periphery of the main area or over the main area in pop up windows or similar graphical elements.

Where the event that is being noticed is a message the scrolling notification for the message may include for example an identifier for the sender of the message and a snippet from the message such as the first few words in an e mail or a subject line from an e mail. The alert may also include an icon showing the type of message such as an envelope for an e mail message. Where the alert is not a message the scrolling notification may include other descriptive or suggestive text or graphics such as the title of a song the status of a device parameter that is being reported the identity of an item e.g. a physical good or a computer application that currently became available at an on line marketplace and other such information.

The user may press a selection button or may press on the area where the notification is being displayed during the display of the alert to bring up the full message. After the notification has scrolled across the status bar an icon may be added to an area in the status bar such as at an unused end of the status bar. When other types of messages or alerts are received their corresponding icons may also be displayed in the status bar. Certain alerts may simply be displayed temporarily and may not have a persistent indicator generated to indicate that the alert occurred for example the changing of songs on a media player running in the background may simply be scrolled once or twice across a status bar and then never appear again. In this manner a user may readily see by looking at the device display the forms of messages that they have received and whether they have received any messages at all of a particular type so that they can readily determine whether to review messages or instead to go about their day.

Although indicators for certain messages may be maintained in the status bar as mentioned above other messages may be more transient. For example a message indicating that a music player has moved to a new song may scroll across a status bar and then disappear. If a user touches the status bar while the message is being displayed the selected area may expand so that all the song in a currently playing album or playlist are displayed. If the user makes no such selection the presence of the sing title will be forgotten after the scrolling of the title is complete. In this manner the reaction of the device to selections in the notification area e.g. in a status bar of a smartphone display .

In one implementation a computer implemented user notification method is described. The method comprises displaying in a status area near a perimeter of a graphical interface a notification of a recent alert event for a mobile device receiving a user selection in the status area and in response to the receipt of the user selection displaying in a central zone of the graphical interface detail regarding a plurality of recent messaging events for the mobile device. The notification can be displayed in place of battery and signal elements in a status bar of the graphical interface and the notification can comprise text that scrolls across the status bar. In addition the method can further comprise removing the text from the status bar after scrolling the text and displaying in the status bar an icon that visually represents an application corresponding to the messaging event.

In some aspects the method further comprises aggregating in the status bar a plurality of icons that are each visually representative of one or more recently received messaging events. The text can include textual content from the alert event. Also the alert event can correspond to a communication from a remote server reporting a message from the group of computer applications consisting of electronic mail chat text messaging voice mail and a posting of data to a shared networked data source. In certain aspects the user selection comprises a long press on a display screen or a pointing device and the display in the central zone comprises a reduced size version of a display of an active application that was in the central area before the user selection.

In yet other aspects the display in the central zone comprises a list of messages from a plurality of messaging applications and the method can also comprise displaying a user manipulable slider mechanism in response to the user selection. In addition the method may include receiving a dragging manipulation of the slider mechanism across the graphical interface moving the slider mechanism in response to the dragging mechanism and displaying the detail regarding the plurality of recent messaging events behind the slider mechanism as it is slid across the display.

In another implementation a machine readable data storage medium is disclosed. The medium has instructions stored on it that when executed cause one or more processors to display in a status area near a perimeter of a graphical interface a notification of a recent alert event for a mobile device receive a user selection in the status area and in response to the receipt of the user selection display in a central zone of the graphical interface detail regarding a plurality of recent messaging events for the mobile device. The notification can comprise text describing the recent alert event and is displayed in place of battery and signal elements in a status bar of the graphical interface. Also the instructions can further cause the one or more processors to aggregate in the status bar a plurality of icons that are each visually representative of one or more recently received messaging events.

In certain aspects the display in the central zone comprises a list of messages from a plurality of messaging applications. Also the instructions can further comprise instructions to cause the one or more processors to receive a dragging manipulation on a touch screen display of the graphical interface from the status area and across the display and move the slider mechanism in response to the dragging mechanism and display the detail regarding the plurality of recent messaging events behind the slider mechanism as it is slid across the display.

In yet another implementation a computer implemented notification system is disclosed. The system comprises a wireless interface to receive data for a user of a mobile device a notification manager to generate a notification message for a device event including device events received through the wireless interface where the notification message includes information that describes the device event and a display manager to generate elements for a graphical display to receive the notification message and to present the notification message in a first zone near a perimeter of the graphical display. The system can further comprise an input device to receive a user selection in the first zone wherein in response to the user selection the display manager displays in a central zone of the graphical interface detail information regarding a plurality of recent messaging events for the mobile device. Also the display manager can display the notification message as text that scrolls in a status bar area of the graphical display. Also the display manager can be adapted to remove the text from the status bar and display in the status bar an icon that visually represents an application corresponding to the messaging event.

In another implementation a computer implemented notification system is disclosed that comprises a wireless interface to receive data that includes messages for a user of a mobile device a notification manager to generate a notification message for a received message that includes information that describes the message and means for generating a display of information corresponding to the notification message on a graphical display. The system can further comprise means for generating in response to a user selection a display of detail information regarding a plurality of recent messaging events for the mobile device.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

This document describes systems and techniques for providing a user of a mobile device with notifications about messaging events and other similar events for the device. Such messaging events may include missed calls voice mails e mails file transfers file uploads and other such events. The notifications may occur in such a manner so as to not disrupt a user from other actions they are performing on the device such as talking on a telephone call or playing a music or video file. In general the notifications may occur by having a notification message which may be an abbreviated form of the actual communication e.g. a name and subject line for an incoming e mail be displayed in a peripheral area at the edge of a display such as a status area or status bar for the mobile device. The status bar is the area in which status indicators such as battery charge level and signal strength level are traditionally displayed typically at the top of a display. For example a portion of the message may be scrolled across the top of the display in a ticker tape manner.

After the message portion has scrolled across the status area an icon may be placed in the status area to indicate to a user that a message has been received since the last time the user checked messages. The status area may then also become selectable by the user so that selection of the status area causes the display of accrued messages to occur. Such selection of the status area may occur by long press on the status area or by pressing on the status area and dragging downward to pull out the messages as if they are mounted on or under a window shade. Where the device has a fairly flush front surface the action may take the form of a finger swipe across the face of the display where the edge of the element showing an extended view of the messaging events sticks to the user s finger as the finger moves past.

In addition where the messages or other such events are large in number and do not all fit on the display at one time the presence of additional off screen messages may be indicated by a fading out of the last message toward the edge of the display e.g. a fade to black where the background is black . Such fading may create the visual impression that the last message is curving back away from the user and into the device as if the messages were printed on a sheet of paper that was bending backward away from the user. The bottom of such a display element may also taper inward slightly at its edges i.e. become narrower and smaller at its lower portion to create the impression that it is moving away from the user.

Referring now to there is shown portions of a mobile device display demonstrating actions in a status bar. In general seven instances labeled a through g of the same display portion are shown in chronological order to demonstrate an example of functionality that may be provided by a notification component on the device. The particular display portion shown here is the top of a graphical display where a status bar is located.

Instance a shows a status bar of a mobile device in a normal state with icons displayed to indicate that the device is currently using GPS and Bluetooth capabilities and also showing the current signal strength and remaining battery power. At such a time the user may be doing nothing with the device e.g. so that the device s desktop and wallpaper are being displayed in the main display area below the status bar or may be operating an application in a main display area of the device i.e. the central larger portion of the display of which only the very top portion is shown here.

Instance b shows what occurs when the device receives an e mail here a message from Frank Fee about a planned night of intramural hockey. To show such a new message to the user of the device the static status indicators may be removed from the status bar temporarily and the name of the sender and the subject of his message may be shown in their place such as by rolling over them visually. For example the name and subject may be scrolled from one side of the status bar to the other e.g. from right to left in this example or may be scrolled from top to bottom or displayed statically in the status bar. In addition an audible prompt such as a beep or a shaking of the device may be provided when the message information begins to be displayed in the status bar in a familiar manner.

Instance c shows the display some time after the e mail message has arrived. When the message initially arrives the text may be scrolled once through the status bar scrolled multiple times or frozen for a time after it reaches the end of the status bar. In this manner the user may have an opportunity to review it without interrupting whatever is occurring in the main zone or area of the display. Eventually however the user will need the status indicators back so that the notification text may be replaced with the status indicators. In addition as shown an icon for the messaging event here an envelope to indicate an e mail is placed in the status bar. In this manner if the user was not looking at the device during the scrolling of the notification text the user may still be alerted to the fact that a message has arrived since he or she last reviewed messages. Although not shown here an indicator such as a small number may be provided with the icon to show how many messages of that type have been received.

At instance d another message has arrived at the device this time a voice mail message from Neal Broten. In this example the device is connected to a system that provides speech to text transcription such as automatic transcription and the first few words of Mr. Broten s message are shown in the status bar behind his name. The name may be determined for example from ANI signals or other similar caller ID signals received by the device or a server providing information to the device and the name may be provided by the telephone network or by the user s device matching the incoming telephone number to a user address book.

Instance e shows an updated status bar where an icon for the voice mail message has been added to the icon for the prior e mail message. In this example the icons are sorted according to priority of importance where voice mails have been determined to be more important than e mails though the order may also represent the category having the most messages the category have the first message or the category having the most recent message among other things.

Instance f shows yet another form of message arriving this time a message reported from the PICASA photo sharing site where Mike E apparently a friend of Neal Broten and Frank Fee has posted new photos to share from their ice hockey league. This message in this example was sent from PICASA with an indicator that the photo posting was by Mike E. Again the name of the person responsible for the message is shown as is an icon showing mountains that are representative of photography and a text string describing the posting. And again at instance g the icons for each of the three messages are shown along with the static status bar icons.

Whenever the notification icons e.g. for e mail voice mail or photo posts in this example are displayed a user may select them or may select more generally in the status bar to display more information about the messages represented by the notification icons as discussed more fully with respect to the following figures. Such selection is discussed next.

The main zone of the left display is shown blank in this example simply to indicate that the current status of the zone may take a variety of forms. For example a wallpaper background with various icons may be displayed with desktop icons i.e. a mode for the device when the user is not focused on any particular application. Alternatively one or more applications may be shown in the main zone such as an application tracking an ongoing telephone call and displaying an image of the person with whom the call is occurring a number for that person and an elapsed time for the call among other things.

The right screen in shows the display after the user has long pressed or dragged downward on the status bar . In this example the main zone has been filed with the various messages that were left since the last time the user had reviewed his or her messages. The messages are shown in a message area in the main zone of the display while the status bar is shown with the message notification icons removed because the user has now been shown the messages and does not need a notification about them . In this example the first message is an e mail from Per Gesele the second is a GOOGLE TALK message from Niklas Green the third is a missed incoming call from Tomas Ledin the fourth is a posting of PICASA photos by Niklas Green and the fifth is a missed call from Tomas Ledin. As shown the messages are organized here from top to bottom in reverse chronological order.

Messages may also be sorted by application. For example a single line of the display may indicate the number of e mail messages a user has received since they last launched or focused on their e mail application while a next line can do the same for text messages downloads and other such notification events. Selection by a user on any one of the lines may cause the corresponding application to be launched or made the focus on the device with the messages received since the user last employed the application listed in the most prominent location in the application.

The messages near the bottom of the message area fade to black in order to provide a visual impression that they are curving back into the dark inside portion of the device. In this manner the display provides the user with a visual indication that there are additional messages off the bottom of the list. The user may employ a trackball or may slide their finger upward across the display to scroll down and see the additional messages. After such scrolling downward the message that is at the top of message area will fade to black to indicate that there are more messages above the message area and that the user can thus scroll back in that direction.

A group of application icons are shown to the right side of the main zone of the display . A user selection of one of the messages in the message area will bring up the application opened to that message while the selection of one of the application icons will bring up the particular selected application with its various messages displayed e.g. in reverse chronological order.

An active application area is shown above the message area . The active application area shows a reduced area view of an application that was running or active in the main zone when the user selected to expand the messaging information. In this example the application is a telephone call that the user was conducting when they chose to look at their other outstanding messages. Before the user selected to see more about the messages the application may have occupied all of the main zone and may have included an extensive amount of information such as an image of the person with whom the call was occurring. To make room for the messages the application area has been shrunk visually here to take up only about twenty percent of the display and now shows only an elapsed time for the call in a telephone icon a status of the call and a name of the caller or callee.

A tab is shown visually at the bottom of the display . In this example the tab is a thin bar extending fully across the bottom of the display with a thickened area in its middle that is labeled with an instruction of close for the user. Such an instruction indicates to the user that selecting the tab e.g. by pressing on it will cause the message area to disappear so that the application area will expand back to its original space. As described below the tab may take other forms and may be dragged upward by a user in a manner like a window shade to fully or partially close the message area . The user may also close the notifications area by dragging upward across it.

The application area may also accommodate multiple applications where the operating system is capable of multitasking. In such a situation each application in the application area may be slightly smaller than that shown in the figure and or the total application area may be larger and the message area may be correspondingly smaller so that the applications are stacked above or next to each other. Also a user may be given the ability to scroll up and down between applications so that the applications will fit better. Alternatively each application that is running may be shown as an icon where the multiple icons are spaced and spread horizontally across the application area and a user may see more detail about a particular application by selecting its corresponding icon. Upon such a user selection the selected application may push the other operating applications out of the way.

The message area may also display other information when a user makes a selection in the status bar including information that depends on the current context of the device. For example a notification area like that shown in may be displayed when an e mail message is scrolling across the status bar or when no alert information for a recent alert is being moved through the status bar . However when the user s selection in the status bat coincides with the presence of other types of alert information in the status bar the functionality provided in the main area of the display may be dependent on the type of alert that is currently occurring. For example if a user is listening to music on the device a song title may scroll across the status bar for several seconds each time a new song starts. If the user selects the status bar during that time the device can infer that interaction with the music player is desired by the user. As a result music player controls e.g. play pause stop next track last track etc. may be displayed along with album art and perhaps a list of songs on the album or next songs in a playlist. The user can then manipulate such controls to change the music that is playing such as by jumping forward one or more songs in the playlist. The user may then drag the area back up under the task bar and may subsequently pull down from the status bar to produce a main display area that shows messaging information again like in rather than music player information.

Also notifications may be provided from an on line applications store for the device. For example a user may download an application and the notification techniques described here may be used to inform the user that a new version of the application is available. If the user selects the status bar while such a notification is being displayed the device may show a display for a download application for the applications store. The notification may also be indicated along with other messages and the user may select the notification in preference to notifications for other services in order to have the download application launch so that the user can choose to obtain the new update.

The display may also show a control such as a selectable graphic button that a user may select to clear all notifications. Such an action will cause the main area of the display to go blank and the icons for each message type in the status bar to disappear.

A status bar is also shown across the top of the display . The status bar in this example is like those status areas discussed above and includes four different messaging icons showing that since the user has last checked or cleared messages the device has received one or more voice mail messages one or more missed calls one or more text messages or chat messages and one or more e mail messages.

The first display in also shows a large circle surrounded by a ring having a downward pointing arrow. This element indicates a press by a user on the device over the status bar with a subsequent dragging downward of the status bar . The element does not appear on the display. Such action may be programmed to result in the expanding of a message area into the main zone of the display . As with the message area discussed above the message area may show the various messages that the user s device has received in the user s absence. And again details about a message are shown to the left while an icon for the particular messaging application is shown on the right. Also selection of a particular message may result in the full message being opened for the user in its corresponding application while selection of an application icon may cause the application to be invoked with its associated messages or other features arranged in a standard manner e.g. reverse chronological order .

In this example there are four total messages and all of the messages fit on the display so there is no need to blend the bottom message into the display background in portrait mode. Also the message area has a semi transparent background so that the active clock application can be viewed behind it. Where the application requires continued user activity e.g. as indicated by a variable set by the user or by an author of the application the application can be displayed in a shrunken window like that shown in such as at the top of the message area or the bottom of the message area . For example as the user pulls the status bar downward the pulling by the user may push down on the top edge of the application area causing it to shrink until it reaches a minimum height like that shown in but with the application area located at the bottom of the display.

The third image on the right shows the device as a slider smartphone having its slider portion slid open to uncover a keyboard. The sliding action or another action has caused the device to change its display to a landscape format from a portrait format. As such the display cannot show all four of the messages so that the third message is shown blending into the black background.

The user may return the device as shown in the right two figures back into the device shown in the left figure but with the messaging icons in the status bar removed by dragging the bar at the bottom of the display upward or in some embodiments by selecting the bar . As shown in the prior figure the bar may alternatively be displayed as a tab to more readily communicate to the user the concept of a pull shade functionality for the display element.

The second display shows by a circle having a ring around it in the status bar a selection by a user such as by moving a pointer to the status bar and pressing a selection mechanism such as a trackball or by directly pressing on the display with a fingertip on top of the status bar. Upon the user selecting the status bar the bar may expand slightly and a slide down indicator may be displayed in the form of a notification bar with up and down arrows. The indicator may visually signal the user that they can pull the indicator down to show messages associated with the notification icons. Alternatively a tab like that shown in may be displayed below the status area.

The third display shows the user dragging the notification bar downward across the main part of the display like a roll shade. At the point shown more messages remain above the top of the display area so that the top displayed message is faded to black at its upper edge to indicate to the user that more messages are left to review. The initially shown message at the bottom of the pulled down section may be a message computed to be at the bottom of the message area once the bar is pulled all the way down to the bottom of the display. In this manner the messages shown may be attached to the notification bar and may move down with it. Alternatively the messages may be unattached to the bar so that sliding the bar down appears to open a window into the area where the messages sit. In such an implementation the top message would appear first at the top of the display and more messages would gradually appear as the user pulls the bar downward opening the metaphorical sliding window or cover on them but with the bottom edge of the messages faded to black all the way down . In this manner for example if a gadget were running near the bottom of the display the user could pull the bar down only so far so as to not cover the gadget.

Certain momentum effects may be provided for the interaction with the notification bar. For example if the user releases the notification bar in the upper portion of the display the messages may spring back upward into the status bar and disappear much like a roll shade that has not yet caught in its first position would spring back. Alternatively if a user drags the bar quickly and releases it the bar may continue moving until its momentum runs out or until it hits the bottom of the display. Also in some implementations if the user pulls the bar below a determined level on the display the bar may automatically keep moving until it reaches the bottom of the display or until it reaches a graphical element that it is not allowed to pass over.

The fourth display shows an example in which the user has pulled the notification bar all the way to the bottom of the display. In this example four messaging events are displayed and an ongoing telephone application is displayed in a reduced area in a manner similar to that discussed for the figures above. The notification icons in the status bar have now disappeared e.g. by fading them out once a substantial portion of the messages has been displayed or when the bar touches the bottom of the display . The notification bar at the bottom of the display may then be selected by the user and slide upward to remove the messages from the display and its motion may be managed in the same manner as its motion downward but perhaps with more of a spring force pulling it back upward.

In certain implementations the top three applications shown here may be generally mutually exclusive because they are each audio functions and it is very hard for a user to process such functions in parallel. In particular a telephone call will generally take precedence over the playing of music or the recording of sound so that when a call is picked up the other sound based applications are paused and moved to the background. As noted above the various reduced sized applications may be shown simultaneously when a user is reviewing messages may be shown only as icons may be shown as an even further reduced size or may be displayed in other appropriate manners.

A number of components are shown schematically inside the device to indicate components in the device associated with messaging notification functionality for the device . One or more of the components may be implemented as part of a programmable microprocessor on the device though the particular components are shown separately in this example for clarity of explanation. Other arrangements of components are also contemplated.

The device includes a display manager to control various elements to be shown to a user on the touch screen while an input manager manages inputs received from the touch screen or other mechanisms such as trackball . Various applications may run on the device and may provide data for graphics to be displayed through the display manager .

A status area display module may be responsible for generating the information to be displayed in the status area of the display on device such as in a status bar along a top periphery of the display. For example the status area display module may gather information needed to generate graphical display elements representing a battery level of signal strength level for the device in addition to icons that represent various feature that are activated on the device . Such information may be obtained for example from a device status tracker .

Various messages may be received over a network such as a wireless communications network connected to the internet via a wireless interface . Information received from the network such as from one or more remote servers may be provided to the applications and information may be passed from the applications back to the network. Information may also be passed after processing to a notification event manager which may manage notifications that are presented to a user through touch screen and or speaker . For example the notification event manager may receive indications from various applications about new events whose occurrence needs to be communicated to a user of the device . The notification event manager may in turn provide information about the messages such as the type of message the name of the sender and a subject line for the message to status area display module which may in turn pass information for displaying a notification like those discussed above to display manager which may have assigned a certain area of touch screen for display of status indicators and notification information.

In addition various forms of storage including volatile storage and persistent storage may be provided on the device . The persistent storage may store for example application programs and other information for operating applications on device . In turn the volatile storage may store information about ongoing applications and also store information needed to generate various graphical displays on the touch screen .

At box status information is initially displayed on the device. Such status information may include for example information about battery life and wireless signal strength among other things. In common implementations status information is displayed in a status bar along a periphery of a display screen on a mobile device such as along the top of a display screen.

The device receives a notification of an event at box . Such a notification may occur after an application has received a new message such as by an e mail client on the device receiving an e mail from a server over a wireless network. The application may then according to an agreed upon API pass limited information about the e mail message to the system such as the fact that the message is an e mail the name of the sender and the subject of the e mail. The device may then display the provided event information in place of status information in the status bar on the device for example through the operation of an event manager in an operating system. For example as shown in the figures above the event information may be scrolled along a status bar of the device display. The application may be an application for the particular type of received message such as an e mail application that has the ability to place information in the status bar. Alternatively the application may be a more general alert application the causes alerts to be displayed without the need to have the underlying application active for the associated type of message.

At box an icon representing the event is displayed. Such a display of an icon may occur when the message or other alert information has completed its display in a status bar. The icon may comprise a simple small icon such as an envelope or other icon that can be displayed readily in the status bar. The icon may notify the user that the event has occurred even after information for the event is no longer being displayed. Additional events including events associated with other applications may later be received and additional icons may be displayed in the status bar for those events. Certain events may simply be scrolled across the display but not followed up with the display of an icon where persistent notice of the events is not required. Such events may include changes in song titles in a music players RSS feed headlines and the like.

The device receives a user s selection of the status bar at box . Such a selection may include a selection like those described above including by a user pressing on the status bar for a long press period and or the user pressing on the status bar and then dragging it downward across the top of the display. Alternatively the user may select another element on the display such as a menu element to have the outstanding un reviewed events displayed.

The device then displays event information for the various events that have been received since the user last checked such events in the central zone of the graphical interface box . Such events may be displayed for example in reverse chronological order from top to bottom. The events may also be group by event type such as by one line in the display listing the number of e mails that have been received since the last time notifications were cleared another listing the number of text messages another listing the number of updates for downloaded applications and the like. The user may then handle each message as he or she sees fit such as by reviewing it and then deleting or moving it. If the user would like to see more about a particular message they may select that particular message and may be taken to the relevant application for that message with the message open. The user may also select an icon to open the relevant application or they may select a line that lists the number of messages of a certain type when such a display is provided and the message previously shown in the display will generally be the top message when the application opens.

The user may then interact as necessary with the various messages and or applications. When the user is done handling the recently received messages the user may indicate an intent to remove the recent received message elements from the display such as by handling each of the messages or by selecting a graphical element to move the recent received message elements up and off the display again so that the previously operating application or applications may take their place again. The device and the user of the device may then continue on with their actions that did not depend on the recently received messages. An selectable control such as an icon may also be provided so that a user may clear their alert events or messages. Such a control may be placed in the form of a bottom in the central display when a user drags down on a status bar so that the user can re set their notifications and the icons in the status bar will be removed to indicate that there are no longer any messages to which the user needs to be directed.

If the user does not make a selection while the alert information is scrolling which may lead to immediately opening the new message in its corresponding application the process may place an icon for the alert in the status area or status bar of the display. For certain types of alerts an icon may not be placed such as those where the user may be interested in the information as it occurs but would not be interested later. To do so the process at box determines whether there have been prior alerts since the user last looked at his or her messages or since the user cleared prior alerts so as to determine whether another icon is already located in the status bar. If there have been no prior alerts then an icon for the current alert is added perhaps with a number 1 near it to indicate that there is only one such message that has arrived during the period. The absence of a number may also be an indication that there was only one alert.

If there has been a prior alert then the process may check for the priorities of the respective alerts box to determine the order in which icons for the alerts should be displayed and may then position the icons for display in the status bar box . Where the same type of message e.g. e mail voice mail etc. has been previously received the display of the icons may stay the same the order of the icons may stay the same but a numerical indicator on the appropriate icon may be incremented by the number of messages arriving during an alerting cycle or the icons may also be reordered so that the message type having the largest number of messages may be displayed in a more prominent position typically the outer edge of a horizontal bar or the upper or lower ends of a vertical bar .

At box the process waits for a user selection such as a user selection in the status bar area though in certain implementations the selection may occur in other manners . If there is no user selection before the next alerting event occurs the process then repeats the steps just described when a new message next arrives.

If there is a user selection then the process identifies the alerts or messages that have arrived since the prior display of messages box such as by checking a buffer of such information. The alerts or messages are then sorted such as in reverse chronological order for display box .

Before displaying the alerts or messages the process determines whether any applications are active on the device that cannot simply be hidden under the messages on the display. Applications that can be hidden include various gadgets such as clocks and the like while applications that cannot include the applications shown in above. If there are active applications that cannot be hidden those applications are repositioned and the central zone of the device where the messages will appear is redefined box . For example the running application may be provided in a smaller area around the edge of the central zone while the messages may then be allowed to fill the remainder of the central zone.

If there are no such active applications then a list of the messages or events that have arrived since the last such display are displayed in the central zone such as in reverse chronological order box . The system may then wait for input from the user such as a user selection of a displayed event box and may then launch or make active the application that is associated with any selected event. For example if the user selects an e mail event then the full e mail may be displayed in an e mail application so that the user may respond to the message file it forward it or conduct the wide variety of other actions permitted by a typical e mail program. The particular displays that provide such display of events or messages and permit user interaction with them may include displays like those shown in the various figures above. Other interaction with the various displayed messages or events may also be accomplished in a similar manner.

Referring now to the exterior appearance of an exemplary device that implements the notification features described here is illustrated. Briefly and among other things the device includes a processor configured to display notifications regarding events on the device and to permit a user to conveniently pull down detail about the events relating to the notifications into an extended view of the events.

In more detail the hardware environment of the device includes a display for displaying text images and video to a user a keyboard for entering text data and user commands into the device a pointing device for pointing selecting and adjusting objects displayed on the display an antenna a network connection a camera a microphone and a speaker .

The display may also show application icons representing various applications available to the user such as a web browser application icon a phone application icon a search application icon a contacts application icon a mapping application icon an email application icon or other application icons. In one example implementation the display is a quarter video graphics array QVGA thin film transistor TFT liquid crystal display LCD capable of 16 bit or better color.

A user uses the keyboard or keypad to enter commands and data to operate and control the operating system and applications that provide for responding to notification of alerts and responding to messages and the like and also to a touch screen . The keyboard includes standard keyboard buttons or keys associated with alphanumeric characters such as keys and that are associated with the alphanumeric characters Q and W when selected alone or are associated with the characters and 1 when pressed in combination with key . A single key may also be associated with special characters or functions including unlabeled functions based upon the state of the operating system or applications invoked by the operating system. For example when an application calls for the input of a numeric character a selection of the key alone may cause a 1 to be input.

In addition to keys traditionally associated with an alphanumeric keypad the keyboard also includes other special function keys such as an establish call key that causes a received call to be answered or a new call to be originated a terminate call key that causes the termination of an active call a drop down menu key that causes a menu to appear within the display a backward navigation key that causes a previously accessed network address to be accessed again a favorites key that causes an active web page to be placed in a bookmarks folder of favorite sites or causes a bookmarks folder to appear a home page key that causes an application invoked on the device to navigate to a predetermined network address or other keys that provide for multiple way navigation application selection and power and volume control.
