This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 484 718 filed May 11 2011 entitled SAFETY RESTRAINT ANCHOR SYSTEM by James Liddle which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety to the extent not inconsistent herewith.

This invention relates generally to systems and methods for anchoring safety restraints to prevent injury in the event of a fall by a user.

In an embodiment of the invention a safety restraint anchor system may include but is not limited to a pole portion a circumferential frame portion disposed about an axis of the pole and at least one safety line anchor.

At constructions sites workers may be required to carry out their work at heights substantially above a grade level or lower floor level e.g. on floor joists foundation walls etc. . Such heights increase the risk of injuries due to falls from these elevated work areas. As such fall protection measures may be employed to prevent such injuries. Previous fall prevention structures have included pre constructed railings scaffolding and the like. To perform this work efficiently it is undesirable to pre construct such static safety structures each time construction workers are required to move to a new area of the construction site. As such it is desirable to provide a safety restraint anchor system configured to allow wide access to various work areas of a construction site while providing fall protection.

Referring to a safety restraint anchor system is illustrated. The safety restraint anchor system may include a substantially vertical pole portion a circumferential frame portion disposed about an axis A of the pole portion e.g. in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the pole portion and at least one safety line anchor mechanism disposed substantially atop the pole portion .

The pole portion may be comprised of a base section A one or more extension sections B and a cap section C. The base section A extension sections B and cap section C may be constructed of any sturdy material e.g. 6 steel tubing and may be of varying lengths e.g. 8 to 13 in length .

Referring to the base section A may be coupled to a base support configured to orient the base section A in a substantially vertical position relative to a construction base surface e.g. a bare earth surface a foundation surface a subfloor surface etc . The base support may include one or more truss members e.g. horizontal extension arm truss members A and or angled brace truss members B which may be operably coupled to one or more flanged portions of the base section A and or one or more base support foot portions .

Each of the extension sections B and the cap section C may include a collar portion having an inner diameter greater than an outer diameter of a portion of the extension sections B and or the base section A so as to receive the extension sections B and or the base section A within the collar portion to extend the height of the safety restraint anchor system to a desired elevation. An extension section B and or the base section A may be received within cap section C to bring the safety restraint anchor system to its final operational height.

As shown in the safety restraint anchor system may include one or more trusses and one or more arcuate portions . The trusses may be combined with one or more arcuate portions to form the circumferential frame portion . For example the trusses may be pie shaped including a first radial truss member A a second radial truss member B and arcuate truss member C connecting the distal ends of the first radial truss member A and the second radial truss member B. The trusses and or the arcuate portions may each include one or more locking bolt apertures . The locking bolt apertures of the trusses and the arcuate portions may be co aligned to receive a locking bolt so as to operably couple the trusses and the arcuate portions . In a particular embodiment six arcuate portions and six trusses may be alternated to complete the circumferential frame portion .

As further shown in the cap section C may include one or more truss mounts . The trusses may include a projection defining a truss mounting aperture . The truss mounting aperture of a truss may be sized to fit around the truss mounts to secure a truss to the cap section C. The truss mounts and the trusses may further include truss locking apertures . The truss locking apertures of the truss mounts and the trusses may be co aligned so as to receive a locking bolt thereby removably coupling the truss mounts to the trusses . Though truss mounts and the trusses are shown in a male female configuration the truss mounts and the trusses may alternately employ a female male configuration without departing from the scope of the invention.

As further shown in the cap section C may include a guy wire mount for affixing one or more guy wires to the cap section C. The guy wire mount may include at least one flanged portion extending substantially radially from the cap section C. The flanged portion may include one or more coupling apertures . The guy wire may be coupled to the coupling apertures of the guy wire mount via a connector e.g. a carabineer type connector . An end of the guy wire opposite the guy wire mount may be coupled to a truss and or an arcuate portion so as to secure the circumferential frame portion in position relative to the pole portion .

Referring again to the cap section C may further include the safety line anchor mechanism . The safety line anchor mechanism may include a base portion which may be operably coupled to the top of the cap section C. The safety line anchor mechanism may further include central shaft portion not shown . One or more rotatable safety line connectors including a shaft receiving aperture not shown may be placed on the shaft. One or more spacers may separate the safety line connectors to allow for the free rotation of the safety line connectors about the axis of the central shaft portion. While shown with three safety line connectors it will be appreciated that the safety line anchor mechanism is extensible to any number of safety line connectors . Each safety line connector may include a safety line coupling aperture . A safety line may be coupled to the safety line coupling aperture via a connector routed through the safety line coupling aperture .

As shown in the safety line may be routed from the safety line anchor mechanism down over the circumferential frame portion where it may be connected to a fall arrest mechanism . The fall arrest mechanism may be a retractable safety line device configured extent and retract during normal operation but lock into a static position when a sudden force is applied i.e. in the event of a fall by a user coupled to the fall arrest mechanism . As shown in the safety line may include one or more rollers . The rollers may be coupled to the safety line at a position such that the rollers contact the circumferential frame portion when the safety line is connected to the safety line anchor mechanism . The rollers may freely rotate about the safety line so as to allow the safety line to easily move around the circumferential frame portion .

It is believed that the present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood by the foregoing description. It is also believed that it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form construction and arrangement of the components thereof without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention or without sacrificing all of its material advantages. The form herein before described being merely an explanatory embodiment thereof. It is the intention of the following claims to encompass and include such changes.
