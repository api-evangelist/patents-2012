title: Interference mitigation in the context of heterogeneous networks with coordinated transmission points with a common transmission point identity
abstract: Technology is discussed for extending frequency and time based approaches, such as Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) and enhanced ICIC (eICIC), to interference mitigation for clusters within a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) of transmission points with a common transmission point identity. Multiple transmission power messages correlated to different transmission point characteristics can be configured among multiple transmission points sharing the same transmission point identity. These multiple transmission power messages can be used to coordinate transmissions from adjacent transmission points on differing frequencies. Additionally, new sets of reference signals can be configured to correlate to different transmission point characteristics. These new, correlated reference signals can be used to decouple measurements used to provide feedback to one set of transmission points from reference signals transmitted by another set of transmission points with the same transmission point identity.

This application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 612 188 filed Mar. 16 2012.

Demand for bandwidth within Wireless Wide Area Networks WWAN standards is always increasing. Also more data intensive services such as streaming video and higher volumes of localized traffic create demand for improved uniformity of service across WWANs including near boundaries between wireless communication towers tower . To address these demands spectrum is being reused by wireless communication towers tower that are closer and closer together.

Additionally WWANs have come to support heterogeneous networks of towers. These heterogeneous networks use relatively low power towers within the coverage area of relatively more powerful towers. The relatively low power towers can improve the uniformity of coverage in high traffic areas and or in regions poorly covered by the relatively more powerful towers. They can also increase bandwidth by offloading some of the traffic from the relatively more powerful towers.

As another approach to improving the uniformity of service towers can be grouped into coordinated clusters. The clusters can be coordinated to allow multiple towers to transmit to and receive transmissions from a single wireless device. Combining reception and transmission capabilities from multiple transmission points can improve services for wireless mobile devices particularly at the boundaries between the coverage areas of adjacent towers.

However each of these approaches to increasing bandwidth also increases the complexity of WWANs. Not only do these approaches involving closer reuse of frequencies overlapping coverage areas and increased transmissions increase complexity they increase the potential for interference and other problems. Furthermore solutions to such increased potential for interference become limited to the narrow confines resulting from the increased complexity.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

Different terminology for wireless mobile devices is used in different specifications. As used herein a wireless mobile device can be a User Equipment UE or a Mobile Station MS among other possibilities. Throughout this application the terms wireless mobile device UE and MS can be used interchangeably.

As used herein the term cellular radio tower is defined as a wireless communication device in a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN configured to communicate with a plurality of wireless mobile devices located within a geographic region referred to as a cell. Different terminologies for cellular radio towers are used in different specifications. Terminology used for different variations of a cellular radio tower can include but is not limited to a Base Station BS an evolved Node B eNodeB or eNB a WWAN transmission point a transmission point and a WWAN node. The terms are used interchangeably unless otherwise noted. The actual definition of a BS or eNodeB is provided in their Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers IEEE 802.16 and Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP specifications.

As used herein the term substantially refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action characteristic property state structure item or result. For example an object that is substantially enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of substantially is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action characteristic property state structure item or result.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Wireless Wide Area Networks WWAN can involve homogeneous and heterogeneous networks with overlapping and abutting coverage areas for different kinds of transmission points therein to increase spectral efficiency. To avoid the interference problems that can result from these overlapping and abutting coverage areas approaches have been developed to coordinate transmission on different frequencies and at different times. In the context of 3GPP coordination on different frequencies is implemented with the standards for Inter Cell Interference Coordination ICIC . With respect to time interference coordination especially for communication resources with fixed frequency allocations is implemented with the standards for enhanced ICIC eICIC .

However these frequency and time based approaches like ICIC and eICIC coordinate transmissions on the basis of transmission point identity. Some heterogeneous network scenarios however cluster multiple transmission points with the same identity. The nature of some transmission points such as RRHs lend these transmission points to share a transmission point identity with another transmission point such as an eNodeB upon which they are dependent. Unfortunately applying legacy approaches to frequency and time coordination based on transmission point identity leads to confusion and problems where multiple transmission points share the same identity. These problems can extend to secondary functions related to the coordination of transmissions such as measurements used to provide feedback information.

The approaches such as ICIC and eICIC can be extended however to scenarios where multiple transmission points share the same transmission point identity. Different approaches can be used to generate messages about power levels at which different transmission points are scheduled for different ranges of frequencies. These messages can be based on characteristics or attributes other than transmission point identity. These characteristics attributes can differentiate distinguish transmission points sharing a common transmission point identity. The messages can be communicated between adjacent clusters of transmission points to coordinate transmissions on different frequencies in non interfering ways.

With respect to time based coordination of transmissions multiple transmission points with a common transmission point identity can be problematic for related feedback measurements. These measurements can be based on reference signals that are configured and allocated based on transmission point identity. As a result multiple transmission points can transmit the same reference signals allocated to the same resources leading to confused and inaccurate measurements.

To address these inaccuracies new sets of reference signals can be configured to correlate to different transmission point characteristics attributes aside from transmission point identity. These new correlated reference signals can be used to decouple reference signals from different transmission points with the same transmission point identity. Decoupled reference signals can then lead to accurate measurements which can lead to accurate feedback. Additional details for approaches to extend legacy approaches to frequency and time coordination to scenarios where multiple transmission points share a common transmission point identity are discussed below.

The first high power transmission point can be a Base Station BS and or a MaCro Node MCN evolved Node eNodeB as is also true of the second high power transmission point . As used herein the term high power transmission point can be replaces with the term MCN and vice versa. The relatively low power transmission point can be a Low Power Node LPN . As used herein an LPN can be one of a micro cell a pico cell a femto cell a home eNodeB cell HeNB a Remote Radio Head RRH a Remote Radio Equipment RRE and a repeater. As used herein the term low power transmission point can be replaced with the term LPN or any of the above enumerated variations and the term LPN can be replaced with the term low power transmission point. Furthermore as an important statement of the generality of embodiments discussed in this disclosure while the terminology of the Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE standard is often used throughout this specification it is not intended to be limiting and there are exceptions in the use of more general terminology in portions of this specification to further communicate this point.

The first coverage area comprises a set of three different substantially hexagonal cells . As used herein the term cell refers to a geographic region over which a transmission point can communicate with wireless mobile devices. The three cells result from three transmission directions from the first high power transmission point the centers of which are depicted with three arrows in . The second high power transmission point MCN also has a coverage area defined by three substantially hexagonal cells resulting from three different directions of transmission as depicted.

Unfortunately a first wireless mobile device which can be a User Equipment UE at the boundary between the second coverage area and the first coverage area can experience inter coverage area interference . For example an intended Down Link DL transmission for the first UE can be transmitted from the second MCN to the first UE. However the first UE can also be illuminated by leaking DL transmissions from the first MCN . In the scenario depicted in these leaking DL transmissions can result in the inter coverage area interference .

As another example of inter coverage area interference problems can also result in scenarios where an Up Link UL transmission from the first UE as received at the second MCN is received together with leaking DL transmissions from the first MCN . Additionally inter coverage area interference can include interference from more than one adjacent eNodeBs transmission points. In some instances LPNs can also contribute to the problem.

Intra coverage area interference can also be a problem. The WWAN depicted in can be described as heterogeneous because of the different types of transmission points therein. Within the coverage area of the first transmission point in the first cell the LPN creates an additional coverage area . This additional coverage area can provide better uniformity of service to a high concentration of localized traffic and or provide improved uniformity on a boundary that may only be weakly covered within the first cell

However the overlap of the first cell by the additional coverage area can result in various forms of intra coverage area interference . For example a second UE in the additional coverage area can send an UL transmission to the LPN . However this UL transmission can be interfered with by leaking DL transmissions from the first MCN . In an alternative example the leaking DL transmissions can interfere with DL transmissions from the LPN to the second UE. Interference from additional transmission points can also add to the problem.

The spatial proximity and overlap demonstrated in corollaries of technologies employed to improve bandwidth and uniformity of coverage contribute to the potential for interference. However they are not the only factors in determining whether interference can occur. Interfering transmissions and receptions of transmissions also involve overlap with respect to time and frequency. Radio resources with respect to time and frequency for transmission and reception in many contemporary WWANs are defined by a version of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM modulation scheme.

The 0.5 ms duration of a slot can coincide with the temporal duration of a Physical Resource Block PRB or RB . A PRB as further defined in 3GPP TS36.211 Sections 5.2.3 and 6.2.3 can be the smallest unit of resource allocation assigned by a transmission point scheduler unit within 3GPP LTE standards. Other standards define analogous units for purposes of resource assignment with respect to time and frequency. In addition to its 0.5 ms temporal span a PRB also spans a range of frequencies. Individual PRBs have distinct frequency spans as depicted by the ascending series of PRBs with respect to frequency in .

More specifically an individual PRB can include 12 different 15 kHz subcarriers on the frequency axis and 6 or 7 OFDM symbols on the time axis per subcarrier. The various subcarriers and OFDM symbols with respect to frequency and time dimensions can create a grid of 84 resource elements REs where a PRB comprises 7 OFDM symbols. An RE can transmit different amounts of bits depending on the modulation used from a single bit in the case of Bi Phase Shift Keying BPSK to six bits for 64 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM or 64 QAM.

The differing frequencies corresponding to different PRBs or other analogous units of resource allocation can be used to avoid interference problems. A little coordination between transmission points can make this interference avoidance possible. The following figure can be used to illustrate.

The first LPN and the second LPN result in a first additional coverage area and a second additional coverage area . The first LPN can be configured to communicate with the MCN over a first backhaul link . Additionally the second LPN can be configured to communicate with the MCN over a second backhaul link . Additionally a backhaul link could be established between the first LPN and the second LPN.

The coordination facilitated over various backhaul links can be used in various ways. For example it can be used to increase uniformity of service. Near the boundary areas of the coverage area and the first and second additional coverage areas is a wireless mobile device which can be a UE. Due to the geographic location of the UE difficulties can arise in providing the same uniformity of coverage for the UE as it might receive at another location.

To improve the uniformity of coverage the backhaul links can be used to coordinate a first transmission from the first LPN co phased with a second transmission from the second LPN to the UE . As co phase transmissions the first and second transmissions can be transmitted simultaneously. In accordance with 3GPP LTE such a simultaneous transmission is referred to as a Joint Transmission JT . An analogous approach can be taken with respect to joint reception of UL transmissions from the UE. Alternatively the transmission point for transmission to the UE or reception from the UE can be changed dynamically with the aid of the coordinating backhaul links depending on changing channel qualities. In 3GPP LTE such dynamic changes are referred to as Dynamic Point Selection DPS .

The coordination facilitated over various backhaul links can also be used to capitalize on the differing frequencies corresponding to different PRBs or other analogous units of resource allocation. As used herein the term PRB can replaced with the phrase units of resource allocation resource block and similar terms and vice versa. For example the power levels for which the MCN is scheduled to transmit on various frequency dependent units of resource allocation PRBs can be communicated over backhaul links between the MCN and the LPNs . With this information the first LPN can schedule a first LPN transmission for a wireless mobile device which can be a UE at different frequencies from those at which the MCN is scheduled to transmit at high power levels to avoid interference. The second LPN can do the same with a second transmission . A similar approach can be used between multiple LPNs and or MCNs. Communication of scheduled power levels at different frequencies is known as ICIC in 3GPP LTE.

At different frequencies the spatial proximity and overlap depicted in no longer present potential scenarios for interference. However as WWANs become more and more complicated to increase bandwidth and uniformity of service among other objectives coordination of frequency transmissions also becomes more complicated. One example of an additional complication is described with the help of the following figure.

The RRH transceivers can each include a backhaul link to the MCN to communicate information and or coordinate transmissions. The backhaul links can also serve to connect the RRH transceivers to their respective control panels residing at a common transmission point MCN eNodeB . Not only do the controlling entities of the RRH transceivers reside at the remote eNodeB but the RRH transceivers share their identity as transmission points with that eNodeB . Other types of transmission points can also share this same characteristic attribute of a shared transmission point identity common to multiple distributed transmission points. The distributed RRHs within the coverage area of the common eNodeB as depicted in are consistent with CoMP scenario 3 and 4 of 3GPP LTE.

Scenarios such as that depicted in in which a single transmission point identity is shared among multiple distributed transmission points can be advantageous. For example allocation of resources for reference signals and or control signals can be based on transmission point identity. A common transmission point identity therefore results in common resource allocations. The common resource allocations at different transmission points can avoid collisions between these reference and or control signals with other information such as data from other transmission points in a coordinated transmission scenario.

For example in 3GPP LTE CoMP scenarios 3 and 4 a common transmission point identity results in a common resource allocation for Cell specific Reference Signals CRS . In 3GPP LTE an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Cell Global Identifier ECGI provides an example of a transmission point identity. The common resource allocation at all transmission points in a coordinated cluster of transmission points for CRS can avoid collisions with resource allocations for Physical Downlink Shared Channels PDSCH at different transmission points also within the coordinated cluster. Other examples are also possible.

However common transmission point identities can complicate various forms of interference arising from the spatial proximity and overlap depicted in . As discussed in more detail below common transmission point identities complicate the approaches to interference mitigation with respect to transmission frequency scheduling and feedback measurements with respect to transmission timing.

As with within the first coverage area several RRHs or other transceivers sharing a common transmission point identity with the MCN are depicted. A backhaul link over which frequency dependent information about power levels can be communicated can exist between the first MCN and the second MCN. A chart of various transmission power levels with respect to frequency dependent units of resource allocation PRBs for the first MCN is also shown. Additionally a similar chart of various transmission power levels with respect to frequency dependent units of resource allocation PRBs for the low power RRHs is provided.

The chart for the first MCN indicates that the first two PRBs with relatively low frequency values in their corresponding frequency ranges are scheduled to be transmitted at high power levels. The remaining PRBs however are scheduled to be muted at low power levels. Conversely the chart for the RRH transceivers indicates all PRBs are schedule for transmission at power levels commensurate to high power levels for the RRH transceivers. Since the RRH transceivers are not capable of transmitting at power levels as high as those of the MCN the power levels for the scheduled PRBs are somewhat lower than those for the MCN. The power levels at which the RRH transceivers are scheduled to transmit are communicated over backhaul links between the first MCN and RRH transceivers similar to the backhaul links described with respect to .

In an effort to reduce inter coverage area interference the first MCN can communicate a transmission power message to the second MCN over the backhaul link between them. However since the first MCN and the RRH transceivers share the same transmission point identity the transmission power message for the shared transmission point identity can include combined transmission power levels with respect to each PRB for both the MCN and the RRH transceivers. A combined power level chart for the combination indicated by the converging arrows of transmission power levels at the first MCN and the RRH transceivers is depicted near the bottom of .

The combined power level chart adds the scheduled transmission power level of the two different types of transmission points sharing the same transmission point identification with respect to each PRB. The two different types of transmission points can correspond to the first MCN and the RRH transceivers. Inasmuch as transmission power messages are communicated on the basis of transmission point identities a transmission power message can then be generated based on these combined transmission power levels. In the scenario depicted in the various RRH transceivers are scheduled to transmit at the same power levels with respect to each PRB. However it is possible that individual RRH transceivers could be scheduled to transmit at different power levels for the same PRBs which would complicate further the transmission power message .

To reduce the load caused by repeated transmission power messages communicated over backhaul links and to facilitate the ease of their interpretation among other reasons a transmission power message can be configured as a bitmap. Each bit in such a bitmap can indicate either with a 1 or 0 whether the transmission power level is either above or below a power level threshold for each PRB at a given frequency range.

One example of such a bitmap based transmission power message in 3GPP LTE is the Relative Narrowband Transmit Power RNTP message. Additional details regarding RNTP can be found in the specifications for 3GPP LTE particularly Technical Standard TS 36.213. As in the example depicted in a single RNTP message is sent for each transmission point identity. Currently therefore in CoMP scenario 3 and CoMP scenario 4 the transmission power levels with respect to both the high power MCN and the low power RRHs are combined when determining whether a particular PRB over a given range of frequencies is above or below a predetermined threshold. As a result the RNTP bitmap does not provide accurate information about the frequencies at which the first MCN transmits at high powers and the frequencies at which an adjacent second MCN could schedule transmissions to avoid interference.

Since the power levels for the RRH transceivers are much less than those of the MCN the second MCN can actually schedule transmissions for the UE without unacceptable levels of interference when the MCN is not transmitting at high power levels even if the RRH transceivers are transmitting at their highest levels. Therefore the information provided by the transmission power message can take away opportunities to avoid inter coverage area interference. The transmission power message simply indicates that transmission power levels are above the threshold on all PRBs. As a result the adjacent second MCN does not know that it could avoid unacceptable inter coverage area interference on all but two of those PRBs.

The first MCN can be scheduled for DL transmissions as a DL transmission point. A high power transmission point chart for power levels with respect to frequency dependent units of resource allocation PRBs is provided. As before the high power transmission point chart indicates that the first two PRBs with relatively low frequency values in their corresponding frequency ranges are scheduled to be transmitted at high power levels. The remaining PRBs however are scheduled to be muted.

A low power transmission point chart is also provided. The low power transmission point chart reports the power levels for the various PRBs at which low power transmission points which can be RRH transceivers are scheduled for transmission power levels and muting. These low power transmission points can share the same transmission point identity with the first MCN .

Unlike in however a first transmission power message is formed on the basis of scheduled power levels for the first MCN without combining scheduled power levels for RRH transceivers. The first transmission power message can be configured to indicate a first set of resource blocks which can be PRBs that are set for transmission above a first threshold and a second set of resource blocks that are set for muting and or transmission at or below the first threshold.

The first transmission power message can comprise a bitmap with a bit for each PRB. Each of these bits can indicate whether or not its corresponding PRB is scheduled to be transmitted above the first threshold . In the example ones are used to indicate power levels above the first threshold and zeros to indicate power levels that are not but these meanings can be switched.

A second transmission power message can be generated in the same way. The second power message can also indicate a first and second set of PRBs based on whether power levels as indicated in the low power transmission point chart for particular PRBs are respectively above a second threshold or not. Depending on the embodiment the first threshold and the second threshold can correspond to different power levels appropriate to the transmission points they are used to provide information for. In some embodiments power levels can be normalized by a maximum transmission power for transmission points sharing a common transmission point identity before determining whether a power level is above the first or second thresholds.

An indicator can be attached to the first transmission power message . The indicator can be configured to identify the one or more attributes of the DL transmission point corresponding to the first transmission power message . One non limiting example of such an attribute can be whether the DL transmission point is a high power transmission point or a low power transmission point. The distinction between high power transmission points and low power transmission points can be based on the maximum transmission power of the transmission point relative to the maximum transmission powers of other transmission points with a common transmission point identity.

Another non limiting example of such an attribute can be a transmission point specific identification. Examples of such an identification can include a virtual cell identification and or an index value within a transmission point index. In such embodiments individual transmission power messages can be provided for individual transmission points not just classes of transmission points within a group of transmission points sharing a common transmission point identity. In such embodiments individual transmission points can have their own threshold values for purposes of transmission power message formation.

In some embodiments the transmission points sharing a common transmission point identity can be the various transmission points within a CoMP cluster such as a CoMP cluster consistent with scenario 3 or 4 of 3GPP LTE. In such embodiments the high power transmission point can be an MCN eNodeB. Additionally the low power transmission points can be RRHs.

Once the various transmission power messages have been formed they can be sent over the backhaul link to the adjacent second MCN . Unlike the single transmission power message sent in at least two transmission power messages are sent . The two or more transmission power messages can be distinguished despite a common transmission point identity by the indicators attached thereto.

In the scenario depicted in the first indicator attached to the first transmission power message indicates that the first transmission power message corresponds to a relatively high power transmission point such as an MCN. The second indicator attached to the second transmission power message indicates that the second transmission power message reports the transmission power level for relatively low power transmission points such as RRHs. The first indicator is depicted with a cross hatched field and the second indicator is depicted with a solid blank field to convey that the two indicators indicate different attributes for the transmission points on which they report. Indicators representative of alternative attributes such as those discussed above are also possible. Although the indicators are located at the tail end of the transmission power messages in they can be located anywhere within such messages.

Despite a common transmission point identity the second MCN can distinguish the first transmission power message from the second transmission power message by the first indicator and or the second indicator . Because of the two transmission power messages the second MCN can determine that although the relatively low power transmission points are scheduled to transmit across all the frequency ranges of the various PRBs the relatively high power transmission point is only scheduled to transmit at high power levels for the first two PRBs. Therefore the second MCN can schedule a wireless mobile device which can be a UE near the boundary between the two coverage areas on a PRB within the same frequency range as a resource block for which the first MCN is set to transmit with a power of less than the power threshold.

With respect to the scenario depicted in the second MCN can schedule a boundary UE specific DL transmission at frequencies corresponding to any of the third fourth fifth and sixth PRBs. Although the low power transmission points are scheduled to transmit within these PRBs the lower power levels make the interference level acceptable. Conversely DL leakage from the first MCN at frequencies for the first two PRBs would make the interference level unacceptable because of the relatively high power levels at which the first MCN transmits.

In certain embodiments consistent with 3GPP LTE the first transmission power message and the second transmission power message can both be RNTP messages configured with one or more indicators . In certain embodiments the absence of an indicator can also be used to indicate that the corresponding transmission power message does or does not have an attribute. In such embodiments two or more RNTP messages can be communicated to adjacent transmission points such as the second MCN over a backhaul link comprising an X2 interface.

Although interference can be avoided in part by the scheduling of differing frequencies within the same coverage area or adjacent coverage areas there are certain communication resources for which this approach is problematic. Such communication resources such as those used for accessing the WWAN and maintaining a radio link e.g. synchronization signals reference signals and control information may not be re schedulable. They may be pre allocated to occupy a set of frequency resources that wireless devices can rely upon them occupying to allow the wireless devices to use the communication resources for the various functions they serve.

To overcome the problems caused by these immovable resources with respect to frequency especially within heterogeneous networks approaches have been developed whereby a transmission point can request that adjacent transmission points provide time slots within which they reduce transmissions. The first transmission point can then use these reduced transmission time slots to schedule transmissions for its own wireless mobile devices thereby reducing interference problems with the adjacent transmission points. By using time in addition to frequency as another resource to avoid overlapping signaling the communication of immovable resources can proceed without interference. Enhanced Inter Cell Interference Coordination eICIC as introduced in Release 10 of the 3GPP LTE specifications provides one example of such an approach that uses the time domain to schedule around interference problems.

In eICIC one eNodeB requests that at least one adjacent eNodeB provide low transmission power time slots. These low transmission power time slots can be provided by reserving certain sub frames similar to those discussed with respect to for low power transmissions. As used herein the term sub frame can be replaced by the term time slot and vice versa. These sub frames are known as Almost Blank Sub frames ABS . An ABS removes as many transmission resources as possible from the sub frame to reduce the potential for interference. However the ABS is referred to as almost blank due to remaining transmission resources that can be deemed worth keeping. For example some transmission resources can be reserved for control information feedback information paging information and or certain reference signals. ABSs can be arranged in repeating patterns. Transmission points adjacent to a transmission point with a periodic ABS pattern can therefore set periodic schedules for transmissions for their associated wireless mobile devices.

Although such time domain approaches to interference mitigation reduce interference and improve channel quality channel quality can still be an important issue. For example selection of a modulation scheme such as BPS K Quadrature Phase Shift Keying 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM or 64 QAM to transmit increasing numbers of bits in each RE can depend on channel quality measurement results. Therefore measurements of channel quality continue to play a role.

The periodic nature of ABS patterns and similar low power transmission power time slot schemes can make it important that reference signals used to measure channel quality also be configured with similar patterns. Otherwise a wireless mobile device making channel quality measurements based on the reference signals may not be able to consistently make measurements on ABSs and non ABSs. Resources can be allocated for reference signals used for channel quality measurements based on transmission point identity in ways that complicate channel quality measurements as explained with respect to the following figure.

A first set of eight sub frames is depicted corresponding to an ABS pattern or similar low power transmission power time slot scheme. The first set of eight sub frames describes the ABS pattern for the MCN as indicated by the MCN icon to the left of the first set of eight sub frames. The first two sub frames of first set of eight sub frames depicted as solid blank fields comprise two ABSs while the remaining six sub frames depicted with diamond cross hatching comprise six non ABSs.

A second set of eight sub frames is also depicted with diagonal cross hatching representative of sub frames transmitted by the RRHs or other transceivers sharing a common transmission point identity with the MCN . However the second set of eight sub frames is not configured with an ABS pattern. Rather the RRHs can use the ABS pattern of the MCN to schedule transmissions for communication resources pre allocated to occupy set frequency resources in time slots or sub frames scheduled for ABSs at the MCN. Scheduling these pre allocated communication resources during these ABSs can allow the RRHs to mitigate interference even though the additional coverage areas of the RRHs overlap the coverage area of the MCN.

The second set of eight sub frames is depicted with a pair of reference signals sets that can be known a priori by or communicated to a wireless mobile device which can be a UE within an RRH coverage area. One or more of these reference signal sets can be measured by the UE to evaluate the channel between the UE and the RRH. However the same pair of reference signal sets are also allocated to the same time and frequency resources within the transmissions from the MCN .

The same pair of reference signal sets can be allocated to occupy the same set of resources within transmissions from the RRH and transmissions from the MCN because the reference signals can be configured and allocated to resources on the basis of transmission point identity. Where reference signals are configured and allocated to resources on the basis of transmission point identity a UE can correlate measurements such as channel measurements to the transmission point pertaining to the transmission point identity. Such reference signals can also be configured and allocated with a periodicity matching the periodicity of an ABS pattern. In the context of 3GPP CRSs provide one example of reference signals that can be configured and allocated on the basis of transmission point identity with a periodicity equal to that of an ABS pattern.

However where multiple transmission points share the same identity confusion can result. With respect to for example any channel measurement for the RRHs based on reference signals provided by the RRHs can be confused by the same reference signals of the MCN . Although time domain based approaches to interference such as eICIC can rely on reference signals configured and allocated on the basis of transmission point identity for channel measurements where one transmission point pertains to a given transmission point identify multiple transmission points with the same transmission point identity can result in inaccurate measurements.

The clustering of multiple transmission points that share a common transmission point identity is a part of different heterogeneous network scenarios implemented to increase spectral efficiency. Different heterogeneous elements such as RRHs share transmission point identities by their nature. In the context of 3GPP LTE CoMP scenario 3 and CoMP scenario 4 provide examples of the clustering of multiple transmission points that share a common transmission point identity. These and other scenarios can rely however on new approaches by which channel measurements can be obtained.

Accurate channel measurements and or estimations can be made for RRHs or other transceivers sharing a common transmission point identity with a high power transmission point such as an MCN. However a new set of reference signals for use in measuring interference is first configured. This new set of reference signals is not configured and allocated on the basis of transmission point identity alone. Rather the new set of reference signals can be correlated with their configuration and or allocation to one or more characteristics attributes of the facilitating transmission point scheduled to transmit them . The one or more characteristics attributes can be used to differentiate distinguish the facilitating transmission point from at least one other transmission point in a cluster of transmission points sharing the same transmission point identity.

Examples of such characteristics attributes can include by way of illustration and not limitation a node layer or a unique identity for a particular transmission point. The node layer can comprise without limitation a high power MCN eNodeB or a set of LPNs such as RRHs . Therefore the reference signals can be configured to be correlated with RRHs a MCN or an individual transmission point within a cluster of transmission points. Because such reference signals can be configured and allocated specific to a subset of transmission points within a transmission point cluster overlapping configurations and allocations with reference signals for transmission points for other portions of the transmission point cluster can be avoided.

Information about the set of reference signals can then be sent to one or more wireless mobile devices which can be UEs associated with the facilitating transmission point . These UEs can then use the set of reference signals to make interference measurements specific to one or more transmission points with the characteristics attributes that can serve as the basis for configuration and allocation of the new set of reference signals . Additionally this new set of reference signals can be configured with a periodicity substantially similar to the periodicity for the ABS pattern one or more transmission points with the same transmission point identity but which do not share the one or more characteristics attributes correlated with the set of reference signals. Furthermore the new set of reference signals can be configured with a first subset of reference signals dedicated to measuring interference on ABSs and a second subset of reference signals dedicated to measuring interference on non ABSs.

In some embodiments the set of reference signals can be generated with substantially zero power. The received signal at a given UE is equal to the channel multiplied by the reference signal plus noise interference. Where the reference signal is zero an estimation of the channel can be avoided because the product of the channel and the zero valued reference signal will be zero regardless of the channel. The equation can therefore be simplified so that the received signal is equal to noise interference. Thus that which is measured during the zero powered reference signals can be attributed to interference from transmission points that do not share the one or more characteristics attributes to which the new set of reference signals has been correlated.

Because the measurements can be decoupled from signals from transmission points that are not of interest even though they share a common transmission point identity with the transmission points of interest the measurements can result in more reliable feedback from the wireless devices making the measurements. These measurements can be used to provide more accurate feedback related to transmission points of interest. Similar approaches are possible where the new set of reference signals involve non zero values. However a channel estimation can be performed first to be able to subtract out the portion of the received signal that does not pertain to interference from adjacent transmission points.

In the context of 3GPP one example of a format for reference signals not tied to a particular transmission point identity is the Channel State Information Reference Signal CSI RS format. Radio Resource Control RRC signaling can be used by an E UTRAN and or an eNodeB therein to configure a first set of zero power CSI RS resources . The first set of zero power CSI RSs can be configured to correlate to one or more characteristics attributes of one or more transmission points of interest within a transmission point cluster. In the scenario depicted in the first set of zero power CSI RSs as with a second set of zero power CSI RSs to be discussed later can correlate to RRH transmission points . In one non limiting example the correlating characteristic attribute can be that the correlated transmission points pertain to a node layer with low power transmission points.

The first set of zero power CSI RSs can be configured to be allocated in the same sub frame for which transmission points in the cluster that do not correlate to the first set of zero power CSI RSs are scheduled for an ABS as depicted by the solid blank field in the first set of sub frames shown above the first set of zero power CSI RSs. A UE can then make a first measurement of the first set of zero power CSI RSs to acquire information about interference during ABS.

Similarly a second set of zero power CSI RSs can also be configured with RRC signaling to correlate to RRH transmission points . The second set of zero power CSI RSs can be configured to be allocated in the same sub frame for which transmission points in the cluster that do not correlate to the first set of zero power CSI RSs are scheduled for a non ABS as depicted by the diamond cross hatched field in the first set of sub frames shown above the second set of zero power CSI RSs. The UE can then make a second measurement of the second set of zero power CSI RSs to acquire information about interference during non ABSs.

The UE can then use the first and second measurements to one or more correlated transmission points to generate feedback to one or more correlated transmission points. Such feedback can take the form of Channel State Information CSI and or Channel Quality Indicators CQI to provide some non limiting examples. Such information can be used to determine modulation schemes and make other decisions assigned to the E UTRAN and component eNodeBs.

Additionally both the first set of zero power CSI RSs and the second set of zero power CSI RSs can be configured with a periodicity equal to the periodicity of an ABS pattern on non correlating transmission points. In typical eICIC scenarios the periodicity of the ABS can be 8 ms. In certain embodiments each set of zero power CSI RSs can be configured 4 ms apart. Additional approaches to synchronizing periodicity between ABS patterns and CSI RS patterns are possible.

If periodic Physical Uplink Control Channel PUCCH CSI reporting is configured reporting parameters such as cqi pmiConfigIndex and cqi pmiConfigIndex2 should be configured to correspond to the first set of zero power CSI RSs and the second set of zero power CSI RSs . If an aperiodic PUCCH CSI report is triggered by a transmission point the closest in time of the first set of zero power CSI RSs and the second set of zero power CSI RSs can be used for the corresponding measurement.

The method can comprise configuring at a DL transmission point a RNTP message. The RNTP message can indicate a first set of resource blocks at which the DL transmission point is set to transmit with a power that is at a power threshold or above the power threshold. The RNTP message can also indicate a second set of resource blocks at which the DL transmission point is set to transmit with a power less than the power threshold.

Additionally the method can comprise identifying an attribute of the DL transmission point corresponding to the RNTP message distinct from a common Cell ID of a CoMP cluster to which the DL transmission point pertains the common Cell ID also pertaining to at least one other transmission point in the CoMP cluster. The RNTP message can be sent via a backhaul link to one or more additional transmission points. The one or more additional transmission points can schedule a wireless mobile device near a boundary for the DL transmission point. The wireless mobile device can be scheduled on a resource block within a same frequency range as a resource block for which the DL transmission point is set to transmit with a power of less than the power threshold.

In some embodiments the attribute of the DL transmission point corresponding to the RNTP message can comprise an indication that the DL transmission point is a high power transmission point. The attribute can also comprise an indication that the DL transmission point is a low power transmission point within the CoMP cluster to which the DL transmission point belongs. In certain embodiments a high power transmission point can be an MCN eNodeB and low power transmission point can be a RRH.

In alternative embodiments the attribute of the DL transmission point corresponding to the RNTP message can comprise an identification unique to the DL transmission point within the CoMP cluster to which the DL transmission point belongs. In such embodiments the identification can comprise a virtual cell identification or an index value within a transmission point index. The transmission point index can be defined for transmission points within the CoMP cluster to which the DL transmission point belongs.

Certain embodiments of the method can further comprise normalizing a power that is set for a resource block by a maximum transmission power for transmission in the CoMP cluster to which the DL transmission point belongs. The normalization can be performed before determining whether to include the resource block in one of the first set of resource blocks and the second set of resource blocks. Additionally in certain examples of the method the power threshold can be unique to the attribute of the DL transmission point within the CoMP cluster of transmission points to which the DL transmission point belongs.

In some embodiments backhaul communication of the message can take place over an X2 interface. Additionally the resource block can include 12 sub carriers within a PRB.

The message module can be configured to generate an RNTP message. The RNTP message can denote whether at least one resource block from a set of resource blocks is scheduled for DL transmission at a power level that is one of above a predefined threshold or not above the predefined threshold. The distinction module can be in communication with the RNTP message module. Furthermore the distinction module can be configured to provide information for the RNTP message distinguishing the facilitating transmission point from which the RNTP message originates. The facilitating transmission point has a Cell ID common to at least one other transmission point in a CoMP cluster to which the facilitating transmission point pertains. The communication module which can be in communication with the distinction module can be configured to communicate the RNTP message from the facilitating transmission point to one or more adjacent transmission points over one or more backhaul links.

In some embodiments the distinction module can provide information distinguishing the facilitating transmission point by providing an indication in the RNTP message as to whether the transmission point is a high power transmission point or a low power transmission point. In certain of such embodiments the high power transmission point and the low power transmission point can belong to the CoMP wherein the CoMP cluster facilitates an ability to coordinate transmission activities between transmission points in the CoMP cluster. In such embodiments the communication module can communicate the RNTP message to one or more transmission points outside of the CoMP cluster.

In alternative embodiments the distinction module can provide information distinguishing the facilitating transmission point by providing a virtual cell identification and or an index value corresponding to a transmit point index. The virtual cell identification and or the index value can uniquely identify the facilitating transmission point among the CoMP cluster. Again the CoMP cluster can be defined by an ability to coordinate transmission activities between member transmission points in the CoMP cluster.

Some devices can further comprise a normalization module in communication with the message module. The normalization module can be configured to normalize a power level of a resource block for the facilitating transmission point. The normalization can be made in terms of a maximum power for the highest power transmission point in the CoMP cluster wherein the CoMP cluster provides an ability to coordinate transmission activities between member transmission points in the CoMP cluster.

The device can also further comprise a threshold module in communication with the message module . The threshold module can be configured to determine a first threshold level for the RNTP message from the facilitating transmission point where the facilitating transmission point corresponds to a relatively high power level. Also the threshold module can be configured to determine a second threshold for the RNTP message where the facilitating transmission point corresponds to a relatively low power level.

In certain embodiments the resource block can comprise 12 sub carriers within a PRB. The backhaul link can be an X2 interface. A high power transmission point can be an MCN eNodeB.

The method can comprise determining at a facilitating transmission point a set of CSI RSs for use in measuring interference. The set of CSI RSs can be correlated to one or more characteristics of the facilitating transmission point. The one or more characteristics can differentiate distinguish the facilitating transmission point from one or more additional transmission points. The differentiation can be made because one or more additional transmission points do not share the one or more characteristics of the facilitation transmission point. The one or additional transmission points can be in a CoMP cluster to which the facilitating transmission point belongs. Information about the set of CSI RSs can be communicated to one or more UEs associated with the facilitating transmission point. The one or more UEs can use the set of CSI RSs to make an interference measurement specific to the at least one facilitating transmission point in the CoMP cluster.

In some embodiments the set of CSI RSs can be configured for transmission with a periodicity substantially similar to a periodicity for an ABS pattern of the one or more additional transmission points. In certain of such embodiments configuring the set of CSI RSs can further comprise configuring a set of CSI RSs with a first subset of CSI RSs dedicated to measuring interference on an ABS. Additionally a second subset of CSI RSs can be configured to be dedicated to measuring interference on a non ABS of the ABS pattern of the one or more additional transmission points. In such embodiments one or more UEs can be configured to provide a periodic measurement report. The periodic measurement report can include a first measurement report for a first measurement of the first subset of CSI RSs. The second periodic measurement report can also include a second measurement report for a second measurement of the second subset of CSI RSs.

Certain embodiments can comprise triggering an aperiodic interference measurement at one or more UEs. The aperiodic interference measurement can be configured to be performed on the first subset of CSI RSs or the second subset of CSI RSs. Whether the aperiodic interference measurement is made on the first subset of CSI RSs or the second subset of CSI RSs can depend on which subset is closest in time to the triggering of the aperiodic interference measurement. Additionally the set of CSI RSs can be generated as signals for transmission with substantially zero power. CSI RSs with substantially zero power can enable the one or more UEs measuring the CSI RSs to attribute a signal measured on the set of CSI RSs to interference.

Depending on the embodiment the one or more characteristics can comprise a first characteristic defined by whether the facilitating transmission point transmits above a threshold power level or a second characteristic. The second characteristic can be defined by an identity of the facilitating transmission point. The identity can correspond to a virtual cell identification or an index value corresponding to a transmission point index. Additionally the set of CSI RSs can be configured consistent with a format for CSI RS. The CoMP cluster discussed above can be a CoMP scenario 3 cluster or a CoMP scenario 4 cluster in such embodiments.

The configuration module can be configured to configure a set of CSI RSs specific to a node layer or a particular transmission point in a CoMP cluster to which the primary transmission point belongs. The communication module which can be in communication with the configuration module can be configured to communicate configuration information from the primary transmission point to at least one User Equipment UE associated with the primary transmission point. The configuration information can allow the UE to make measurements of interference within the CoMP cluster.

In some embodiments the configuration module can configure one or more CSI RSs in the set of CSI RSs with zero power for transmission. Additionally the configuration module can configure the set of CSI RSs specific to the node layer or the particular transmission point in the CoMP cluster in terms of resource allocation for positioning and sequencing of the set of CSI RSs.

Also with respect to the configuration module the configuration module can be configured with a periodicity for the set of CSI RSs with a sub frame offset to coincide with a periodicity for an ABS pattern of one or more additional transmission point. In this way interference measurements can be correlated with the ABS pattern. The configuration module can also configure a first CSI RS group within the set of CSI RSs on which to measure an ABS and a second CSI RS group within the set of CSI RSs on which to measure a non ABS. The configuration of the first CSI RS group and the second CSI RS group can be based on information about the ABS pattern of the at least one additional transmission point received by the primary transmission point.

With respect to the communication module the communication module can communicate with one or more UEs associated with the primary transmission point to provide independent measurement reports. The independent measurement reports can correspond to the first CSI RS group and the second CSI RS group for periodic reporting. Alternatively the communication module can configure one or more UEs associated with the primary transmission point to provide an independent measurement report. The independent measurement report can correspond to a closest of one of the first CSI RS group and the second CSI RS group to a sub frame on which an aperiodic request is made by the primary transmission point.

In some embodiments CSI RSs in the set of CSI RSs can be configured as CSI RSs. A CoMP cluster can be a CoMP scenario 3 cluster or a CoMP scenario 4 cluster. The node layer can comprise a high power MCN eNodeB or a set of LPNs in the CoMP cluster.
