title: Method and apparatus for automatic mobile communications restriction
abstract: Methods and related systems monitor a mobile communications device to determine if it is in a moving vehicle. If the device is determined to be in a moving vehicle, a database is accessed. The database contains information on locally imposed restrictions on usage of mobile communications devices while driving. The obtained information is used to impose appropriate communication restrictions on the mobile device. As long as the mobile communications device continues to be in the moving vehicle, its geographical location is monitored and, if it is determined that the device has entered a new geographical location, the database is again accessed and the restrictions are modified accordingly.

The distractions caused by operating a mobile communications device such as a wireless phone and or a mobile tablet while in a moving vehicle may result in life threatening accidents. For example a driver operating a moving vehicle may need to use one hand to hold his her mobile device and or split his her attention between watching the road and dialing a number or reading a text message or email.

In the recent years significant effort has been focused on preventing access to mobile communications devices while operating a motor vehicle. For example in the United States some regions have imposed restrictions on usage of mobile communications devices while driving. However the restrictions imposed are not universal and may vary from one locality to another with the geographical dividing lines perhaps being unclear. In addition some municipalities continue to allow the usage of mobile devices while driving but restrictions on usage of certain mobile communications features e.g. text messaging exist. Referring to states alone as of July 2012 10 states prohibit all drivers from using handheld cell phones while driving 32 states ban all cell phone use by novice drivers whose definition of age varies from state to state school bus drivers in 19 states may not use a cell phone when passengers are present 39 states ban text messaging for all drivers 5 additional states prohibit text messaging by novice drivers 3 states restrict school bus drivers from texting. Arkansas and Illinois ban the use of handheld cell phones while driving in a school zone or in a highway construction zone. Texas bans the use of hand held phones and texting in school zones. This becomes even more complicated as counties or even towns cities may have even more restrictive ordinances on mobile device use than the region in which they are located.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and or circuitry have been described at a relatively high level without detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Certain embodiments relate to automatically restricting mobile communications of a mobile communications device while in a moving vehicle depending on local laws and regulations. In some embodiments a geographical location of a mobile communications device disposed in a moving vehicle is determined and information relating to communication restrictions to be imposed on the mobile communications device due to being in the moving vehicle in the geographical location is obtained. The obtained communication restrictions may then be imposed on the mobile communications device. In certain embodiments the local laws and regulations may be available for display on the mobile communications device and or on a display device connected to the mobile communications device. In certain embodiments public notifications specific to mobile communications devices that are moving and in the specific geographical area may be provided to the mobile communications device through a similar communication path as the restriction information.

In some embodiments the information may be obtained from a database that contains information on communication restrictions imposed on the mobile communications device due to being in the moving vehicle over various geographical locations. The communication restrictions may include legislatively imposed restrictions on usage of the mobile communications device while disposed in the moving vehicle in the geographical area.

In certain embodiments the geographical location of the mobile communications device may be monitored and in the event the mobile communications device has entered a new geographical location in which new communication restrictions are to be imposed on the mobile communications device due to being in the moving vehicle the communication restrictions imposed on the mobile communications device may be modified. In some embodiments the geographical location of the mobile communications device disposed in the moving vehicle may be determined over predetermined time intervals that may or may not be adjusted based on various factors.

The communication restrictions may include restrictions that reduce or restrict usage of mobile communications functions provided by the mobile communications device. In some embodiments the mobile communications functions may include at least one of voice call video call web browsing text messaging instant messaging or social networking e.g. Twitter Facebook etc. . Connectivity restrictions can be invoked in several ways. In one example connectivity restrictions are invoked by directly turning ON OFF a mobile communication function. In another example connectivity restrictions can be invoked by modifying the user interface for accessing that function e.g. preventing access to certain features . For example while a locality may not allow text messaging it may allow text to speech conversion. In this example the user interface would restrict the text messaging but modify the user interface such that text to speech conversion could be invoked.

In certain embodiments the communication restrictions may be prevented from being imposed on the communications device in response to detecting that the mobile communications device is connected to a unit that provides hands free access to the mobile communications device. In some embodiments the communication restrictions may be prevented from being imposed on the communications device in response to receiving a request for conducting an emergency communications call.

Each locality R . . . Rn included in the driver s travel route may impose regionalized restrictions or limitations on usage of mobile communications devices while driving. For example a first region R may allow a driver to utilize all available communication features e.g. voice calls text messaging and web access of his her mobile communications device while driving and not impose any restrictions or limitations on usage of mobile communications devices. A second region R may impose specified limitations and restrictions on some features while driving e.g. text messaging and web access but allow usage of other features e.g. voice calls . A third region Rn may completely restrict handheld usage of mobile communications devices while driving.

The driver may connect to a communications network via a communications links and thereby be able to communication through various communications functions e.g. voice calls video calls data access web browsing text messaging etc. using his her mobile communications device . Examples of the mobile communications devices that may be used with the embodiments disclosed herein include but are not limited to mobile phones mobile tablet computers Personal Digital Assistants portable televisions laptop computers mobile digital video recorders etc.

In certain embodiments a feature restrictor may be utilized to monitor the mobile communications device to determine whether the communications device is in a moving vehicle and if so control the communication features offered by the mobile communications device . In some embodiments the feature restrictor may be a downloadable application program that is downloaded in the mobile communications device via a communications network from an external source such as a server not shown . In some embodiments the feature restrictor may be maintained by a service provider that provides the mobile communications device with communication features. For example the mobile communications device may send speed information and geographic coordinates to the service provider at predetermined intervals. In one embodiment the mobile communications device may contain a global positioning system GPS receiver in the mobile communications device and that obtains the geographic coordinates from the GPS system. In this regard the feature restrictor may determine the activity of the user and the location of the mobile communications device e.g. on which highway the user is driving and the location . Further the feature restrictor may retrieve the rules for that location and stop communications from to the mobile communications device e.g. among other functionalities .

In some embodiments the feature restrictor may be included in the mobile communications device . In this case the feature restrictor may be built in hardware and or be a computer implemented product. In some embodiments the feature restrictor may provide notifications as to what restrictions are currently in place on a user interface of the mobile communications device . For example in some embodiments the feature restrictor may include an application programming interface API .

The feature restrictor may include a mobile communications device monitor and a mobile communications device controller . Although show as being part of the same computing device in some embodiments the mobile communications device monitor and the mobile communications device controller may be in different computing devices. The mobile communications device monitor and the mobile communications device controller may be at different locations and be connected via a link e.g. a physical link or a wireless link . For example the mobile communications device monitor may be included in the mobile communications device and the mobile communications device controller may connect to the mobile communications device monitor via the communications network .

Regardless of where the mobile communications device monitor is positioned the mobile communications device monitor monitors the mobile communications device and determines whether the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle . The mobile communications device monitor if not present in the mobile communications device may determine that the mobile communications device is a device that is subject to legislation regarding restriction of device use in a moving vehicle through a mobile device number MDN or mobile subscriber integrated services digital network number MSISDN which uniquely identify the device on the network. For example the mobile communications device monitor may identify position changes that are above a predetermined threshold e.g. 8 mph as an indication that the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle . Other indicating factors and other techniques known in the art may be used to determine that the mobile communications device is used within a moving vehicle .

In some embodiments the vehicle can determine whether a mobile communications device is in the vehicle . For example the mobile communication device may be equipped with Near Field Communication NFC technology which can be used to communicate with an NFC tag in the vehicle when in close proximity e.g. 

As discussed above the speed at which the location of the mobile communications device is traveling may be used to indicate that the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle . For example in some embodiments the mobile communications device monitor may determine that the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle by detecting whether the speed of the mobile communications device is above a predetermined speed threshold.

Several factors may affect the predetermined speed threshold. For example the threshold may be set at a speed that is above that for walking e.g. 1 2 mph or bicycling e.g. 8 mph . In one example the predetermined speed threshold is pre programmed by the mobile communications device . Additionally or alternatively the speed threshold may be set by the service provider that provides the communications access to the mobile communications device . Further the speed threshold may be set by the manufacturer of the moving vehicle . In other examples the speed threshold may be set by the feature restrictor or database . In one example there is a maximum speed threshold e.g. over which functionality of the mobile communications device is not restricted by the mobile communications device controller . For example the restrictions may be removed or different when traveling in an airplane e.g. 120 mph .

In certain embodiments the mobile communications device monitor may obtain information regarding the speed at which the mobile communications device is being moved from a speed detector module not shown or a speed detection application program not shown . The speed detector speed detection program detects the speed at which the location of the mobile communications device is being changed. In certain embodiments the speed detection module program may be included in the mobile communications device monitor . In some embodiments the speed detector may be external to the mobile communications device monitor and or be physically or wirelessly coupled to the mobile communications device monitor . For example in certain embodiments the speed detector may be included in the vehicle if the mobile communications device is connected to the vehicle the mobile communications device or downstream with respect to the mobile communications device monitor and within the communications network or in an element connected to the communications network .

As discussed above the speed of the mobile communications device monitor may be provided by the GPS receiver of the mobile communications device . In one example the mobile communications device monitor may determine the speed of the mobile communications device through cell tower triangulation. In other embodiments the mobile communications device and the vehicle in which the mobile communications device is traveling may communicate with the vehicle transmitting speed to the mobile communications device .

In one example the mobile communications device monitor may continuously monitor the speed at which the location of the mobile communications device changes. Additionally or alternatively the mobile communications device monitor may determine the speed at which the mobile communications device is being moved at predetermined intervals e.g. to conserver power . In one example the predetermined intervals depend on the distance from a geographic boundary. In one example the time intervals for monitoring the speed at which the mobile communications device is being moved may be set by the manufacturer of the mobile communications device or by the service provider of the mobile communications functions.

The mobile communications device monitor may further determine the geographical location and locality in which the mobile communications device monitor is traveling. Various mobile communications device tracking schemes may be used. For example in some embodiments multilateration or triangulation of radio signals between radio towers of the network and the mobile communications device may be used to determine the location of the mobile communications device . Additionally or alternatively global system for mobile communication GSM localization may be used to determine the location of the mobile device . Further in certain embodiments the mobile communications device monitor may use GPS information to determine the geographical location of the mobile communications device .

In some embodiments the GSM localization may be network based. Specifically network infrastructure e.g. antenna or base station location relative to the mobile communications device may be used to identify the location of the mobile communications device . In certain embodiments a device based technology that requires installation of client software on the mobile communications device may be utilized to determine the location of the mobile communications device . In some embodiments a subscriber identity module SIM not shown that may include for example personal information of the account holder his or her phone number address book text messages and other data is included in the mobile communications device to help identify the mobile communications device . For example the SIM may also be used to obtain information identifying the cell site serving the mobile communications device and thereby obtain the location of the mobile communications device . In some embodiments various combinations of the identification schemes described above may be utilized to determine the location of the mobile communications device .

Once the location of the mobile communications device is identified information regarding the specific locality e.g. state or town in which the mobile communications device is positioned may be obtained using the location information. In certain embodiments the geographic coordinates of the location of the mobile communications device may be utilized to specify the locality in which the mobile communications device is positioned.

In certain embodiments the mobile communications device monitor may monitor the location and or locality of the mobile communications device to determine if the mobile communications device has entered a new locality. Further in some embodiments the mobile communications device monitor may store current locality information of the mobile communications device e.g. in a memory not shown and use the stored locality information at a later time to determine whether the mobile communications device has entered a different locality. For example boundaries of each locality are stored and the geographical coordinates are compared to the present location of the mobile communications device . It should be noted that there may be nested ranges such as a school zone first locality that is within a town second locality that is within a county third locality that is in a state fourth locality . In one example the restrictions are cumulative. If there are conflicts between the restrictions between the nested localities the most restrictive restrictions hold.

If monitored periodically or sporadically the time intervals at which the mobile communications device monitor monitors the location and locality of the mobile communications device may be provided by the network provider. In certain embodiments the time intervals at which the location and locality of the mobile communications device are monitored may be determined as a function of the speed at which the moving vehicle is traveling.

In certain embodiments location information indicating the distance between the current locality of the communications device and nearby localities may be used to determine the appropriate time intervals between the instances of mobile communications device locality determination. For example if it is determined that the moving vehicle is currently positioned in New Brunswick N.J. and is traveling west at the speed of 65 miles per hour the distance and estimated travel time to nearby localities e.g. estimated distance and travel time to Pennsylvania border may be used in determining the appropriate time intervals between the instances of mobile communications device position and locality determination.

In certain embodiments the cardinal direction of the travel of the moving vehicle may also be considered in determining the appropriate time interval. For example if it is determined that the moving vehicle is currently positioned in New Brunswick N.J. depending on the cardinal direction of travel e.g. traveling east to New York or west to Pennsylvania the appropriate time interval between the instances of mobile communications device locality determination may be calculated.

In one example the frequency of the intervals may depend on the speed location type of road being traveled and direction of travel. By way of example assume that a user has just crossed the NJ NY border. In this regard the intervals may be very frequent. As the user moves further into NY e.g. away from the boundary the frequency of intervals decreases. In one example the frequency of the intervals increases based on priority i proximity to the boundary border ii Direction e.g. moving towards away or parallel to the border and iii speed of travel. Based on these variables the soonest possible time that the user could reach the boundary is calculated. Another interval may be scheduled for this calculated time.

In event the mobile communications device monitor determines that the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle the mobile communications device controller is signaled. Specifically the mobile communications device monitor forwards the obtained information regarding the position and locality of the communications device to the mobile communications device controller . In certain embodiments the mobile communications device monitor and the mobile communications device controller may be independent computing devices such as servers or application programs that are connected to each other e.g. network connection . In some embodiments the mobile communications device monitor and mobile communications device controller may be included in a single computing device or application program.

The mobile communications device controller in response to the information obtained from the mobile communications monitor communicates with a database that includes certain information regarding the regions R . . . Rn of the geographical area covered by the driver s drive route. Specifically the mobile communications device controller in response to the information forwarded by the mobile communications device monitor accesses a database that includes information regarding the restrictions and limitations imposed on usage of communications devices in various localities and obtains information pertaining to the restrictions and limitations imposed in the current locality in which the mobile communications device is positioned. For example the mobile communications device may access the database through the carrier s network via cellular data or Wi Fi connection. The mobile communications device controller utilizes the information obtained from the database to control the usage of the mobile communications device .

The mobile communications device controller utilizes the information included in the database to determine the extent of communications limitation and or restriction that should be imposed on the communications device. Appropriate restrictions are subsequently imposed on the mobile communications device . The restrictions may be imposed depending on their type by restricting device communications e.g. turning off restricted features restricting general access to the device e.g. imposing a general software lock on the device restricting access to device features e.g. imposing a key pad lock to prevent text messaging etc.

The database may be owned and or maintained by various entities. For example in certain embodiments the database may be owned and or maintained within the network and or by the service provider that provides the mobile communications connectivity to the mobile communications device . In some embodiments the database may be maintained locally within the mobile communications device . In certain embodiments the database may be maintained outside of the mobile communications device and upstream from the mobile communications device in a server connected to the communications network . In this case the database may be owned and or maintained by a private third party or by a governmental agency.

The database may include information regarding state and local laws regulations that impose penalties for the usage of mobile devices while driving in various localities. In some embodiments the database may be a lookup table. In some embodiments the database may be updated as new laws regulations are imposed or as changes made to the existing laws regulations.

In certain embodiments in addition to the information regarding legislation related to mobile communications device use while in a moving vehicle the database may include other information pertaining to the current locality in which the communications device is located. For example the database may include information regarding seatbelt laws e.g. whether a passenger riding in the backseat of the vehicle needs to wear a seatbelt car seat laws e.g. weight and age requirements for using car seats or booster seats speed limits etc. In certain embodiments the database may include or query other databases for local information and alerts such as local news local traffic reports and alerts local weather reports and alerts other local advisories e.g. traffic conditions in the general area and or along specific roads such as that being traveled currently by the vehicle alarms or alerts e.g. amber alerts etc. This information may be delivered to the mobile communications device when the mobile communications device is controlled or at a predetermined time before or after controlling the mobile communications device .

The mobile communications device monitor continues to monitor the mobile communications device to determine whether the mobile communications device is still in a moving vehicle and if so whether the mobile communications device has entered a locality which may have different restrictions on usage of mobile communications devices from the previous locality. If it is determined that the communications device has entered a new locality the mobile communications device controller is informed. In response once again the mobile communications device controller accesses the database to determine whether the geographical restrictions imposed in the new locality are different from those imposed in the previous locality. If so the mobile communications device controller modifies the imposed restrictions on the mobile communications device accordingly.

For example assuming that the mobile communications device is positioned in a moving vehicle traveling in a region that does not allow usage of the mobile communications device for conducting voice calls or text messaging while driving e.g. a construction or school zone the communications device controller obtains this restriction information from the database and restricts device communications for conducting voice calls and text messaging. For example the user interface of the mobile communications device may not display options for placing or answering calls. In one example if a call in process when the user enters a locality that does not allow the use of a mobile communications device the call is severed or a notification is provided to the user e.g. via audible tone haptic signal visual signal or any combination thereof . In one example all non hands free use of a mobile communications device is restricted. In one example only emergency calls are not subject to restrictions.

In event the mobile communications device controller is informed that the mobile communications device has entered a new locality the mobile communications device controller accesses the database again to obtain relevant restriction information for the new locality. The limitations and restrictions imposed on the mobile communications device are modified based on the newly acquired information. For example assuming that the mobile communications device has moved from the region that did not allow usage of the mobile communications device for conducting voice calls or text messaging while driving to a region that allows for usage of mobile communications device for conducting voice calls but restricts usage for text messaging the communications device controller maintains the previously imposed limitations on text messaging features but permits the mobile communications device to conduct voice calls.

In certain embodiments in addition to or in place of restricting the communications features the mobile communications device controller may inform the driver of the imposed limitations. For example in one embodiment the mobile communications device controller may display a listing of available and restricted function on a display screen not shown of or connected with the mobile communications device . In certain embodiments the mobile communications device may include an application programming interface or a user interface that displays a listing of available and restricted function in a current geographical locality and or provides the user with a summary of features that may be used in the current locality while driving.

In certain embodiments in addition to or in place of restricting mobile communications of the driver or notifying the driver of possible restrictions usage of mobile communications devices the mobile communications device controller may notify the driver of other information regarding the current locality in which the mobile communications device is located. The mobile communications device of the driver can be determined in several ways. For example a connection to a car dock connection via Bluetooth etc. is indicative that the communications device is associated with the driver e.g. and not a passenger . In one example the driver indicates on the user interface of the mobile communications device that it is that of a driver thereby being able to receive restriction updates in different localities.

In one example the mobile communications device controller may provide the driver with information regarding seatbelt laws car seat laws etc. In certain embodiments the mobile communications device controller may provide the driver with local information and alerts such as local news local traffic reports and alerts local weather reports and alerts other local advisories alarms or alerts e.g. amber alerts etc.

In certain embodiments the mobile communications device controller may provide the driver with instructions that assist the driver in complying with local laws and regulations. Further in certain embodiments the mobile communications device controller may provide the driver with instructions that ensure the driver s safety. For example in certain embodiments the mobile communications device controller may inform the driver that certain speed requirements are in effect due to the existing road or weather conditions.

In certain embodiments the mobile communications device controller may communicate with the driver through an audio or video system of the moving vehicle e.g. through a wired or Bluetooth connection between the mobile communications device and the vehicle . For example in some embodiments information regarding local laws regulations concerning usage of mobile communications devices and or local information alarms and alerts may be communicated with the driver through a radio included in the moving vehicle . The video or audio system of the vehicle may be built into the vehicle or be an external unit that has been coupled with the car e.g. via a physical connection or wirelessly .

In certain embodiments the vehicle may be equipped with a dock for docking the driver s mobile communications device and providing the driver with hands free access to the mobile communications device . The dock may be placed anywhere within the moving vehicle that is accessible to the driver . The dock may be a built in unit that is installed at the time of manufacture by the vehicle manufacturer or an external unit that is installed in the vehicle . The dock may provide the driver with the ability to conduct hands free communications calls.

In certain embodiments the mobile communications device is able to electronically detect that it is installed in the dock . In some embodiments the mobile communications device monitor may obtain certain information from the mobile communications device over the communications network indicating that the mobile communications device is in a docked state i.e. coupled with the dock .

Further although not shown in some embodiments the driver may use a headset or a Bluetooth system that enables the driver to use his her mobile communications device in a hands free mode. Other hands free options available in the art may be used to provide the driver with hands free access to his her mobile communications device .

In some embodiments if the mobile communications device is determined to be in a hands free mode e.g. docked state or using a Bluetooth system no further action is taken and the driver is allowed to utilize the communication features provided by the mobile communications device .

In certain embodiments if the mobile communications device is determined to be in the hands free mode the mobile communications device monitor informs the mobile communications controller that the mobile communications device is in the hands free mode. In some embodiments if it is determined that the mobile communications device is in an area that allows hands free operation the mobile communications controller may restrict or cause restrictions of all communication features to the mobile device other than the features that have an audio interface.

In certain embodiments the mobile communications controller in response to determining that the mobile communications device is in the hands free states accesses the database to determine the communication features that are available to the driver while using a hands free enabled mobile device in his her current locality. Once the available features for a hands free enabled mobile device are determined the mobile communications device controller utilizes the determined information to restrict or cause restrictions of communication features accordingly.

The system may include a processor e.g. Central Processing Unit that carries out the operations of the system executes various instructions and manipulates data structures from the main memory . The processor may be coupled to a main memory . The main memory may be a computer readable memory and include combinations of non volatile memory devices. The main memory may be configured to hold various software and computer executable instructions and data structures including computer executable instructions and data structures that implement aspects of the techniques described herein. In certain embodiments the main memory may be included in a subscriber identity module SIM card of mobile communications device shown in . In certain embodiments the main memory may be included in a universal integrated circuit card UICC of mobile communications device .

In some embodiments the software may implement the procedures for monitoring the mobile communications device as described above with relation to the mobile communication device monitor of to determine if the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle and if so determine its location and locality. Further in certain embodiments the software may implement the procedures for controlling the mobile communications device as described in relation to mobile communications device controller of .

The main memory may also include an operating system that implements various conventional operating system functions including memory management and controlled access to various devices such as a database storage and task and process scheduling. The data storage may include content for use with embodiments disclosed herein such as database . In some embodiments information indicating the current position of the moving vehicle may be stored in the data storage .

The processor may be coupled to various interfaces via an input output I O device interface . The I O device interface may include logic to interface with various input and or output devices such as a keypad or mouse and with the processor and allow signals to be transferred between the processor and other components. Further interface devices such as speaker not shown microphone not shown peripheral devices and display may be used to transfer signals to from the processor and main memory . In some embodiments the input output interface may include a USB port not shown .

If the device is determined as not being in a moving vehicle no action is required and a user may be allowed to use all communication features offered by the mobile communications device . In one example upon determining that the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle it is determined whether the mobile communications device is in a hands free state e.g. allows hands free operation and the mobile communications device is used in a hands free mode. As noted previously in some embodiments the mobile communications device may indicate e.g. by transmission of a signal to the mobile device monitor that it is in the hands free mode. Alternatively in certain embodiments a dock or a hands free enabling unit may indicate to the mobile device monitor that it is coupled with the mobile communications device . If the mobile communications device is determined to be in a hands free state access to communications features are allowed . In some embodiments the determination of whether the mobile communications device is operated in a hands free mode does not immediately provide access to the communications features. Rather it is a prerequisite to being able to move on to the step of comparing the speed at which the mobile communications device is traveling to a speed threshold e.g. .

For example in step the speed at which the mobile communications device is traveling is compared against a speed threshold. If the speed threshold is below a certain predetermined level or outside a predetermined range access to the communications features of the mobile communications device is allowed. Of course in other embodiments the communications features of the mobile communications device may be restricted for reasons other than those of being in a moving vehicle e.g. the mobile communications device being located in a restricted area .

The speed threshold may be set using various factors. For example in certain embodiments the threshold may be set at a level that corresponds to traveling by any method other than walking. In certain embodiments the threshold may be set at a level corresponding to traveling speed e.g. on a roadway . As indicated above in other embodiments the speed threshold may be the lower speed of a speed range outside of which communications are permitted to proceed without restriction by the mobile communications device controller .

Although not shown in some embodiments the speed threshold may vary dynamically and depend on the local speed limits. In such embodiments the position and locality of the mobile communications device may be determined prior to comparing the speed against the threshold. Once the locality is determined a database e.g. database including appropriate speed thresholds for each locality may be accessed to determine the appropriate speed threshold that should be applied. For example the mobile device monitor may determine that the mobile communications device is in a moving vehicle that is traveling in a school zone. In response the mobile device controller accesses the database to obtain the appropriate speed threshold that should be applied in a school zone. The obtained speed threshold is used to determine whether the automatic restrictions described herein should be applied to the mobile communications device or whether communication features should be provided .

In some embodiments the speed threshold may vary depending on the amount of traffic on the travel route of the moving vehicle . In certain embodiments the speed threshold may vary depending on the time of the day. For example in some embodiments the speed threshold may be reduced at dusk and returned to a higher level at dawn.

In some embodiments the speed threshold may be pre programmed by the original device manufacturer of the mobile communications device . Additionally or alternatively in certain embodiments the speed threshold may be set by the service provider that provides the communications access to the mobile communications device . Further in some embodiments the speed threshold may be set by the manufacturer of the moving vehicle . In other embodiments the speed threshold is set by a third party or governmental database such as database .

In the event the speed at which the mobile communications device is being moved exceeds the predetermined threshold the geographical location e.g. position and locality of the mobile communications device is determined . The database is accessed and information pertaining to appropriate restrictions for the determined geographical location is obtained . If needed appropriate restrictions are imposed on the mobile communications device .

The procedures continue to monitor the mobile communications device as indicated in relation to e.g. every few minutes or so depending on the speed and perhaps distance from a geographic boundary obtain its geographical location and determine if the geographical location of the mobile communications device has changed . If the geographical location has not appreciably changed as determined using settings within the mobile communications device e.g. 100 feet within a predetermined time the procedures once again determine if the device is in a moving vehicle . If the geographical location has changed the database is queried for restrictions to determine if the previously imposed restrictions should be modified.

Although not shown in in certain embodiments if it is determined that the device is in a hands free state the procedures may proceed to compare the speed threshold and if exceeding a certain threshold obtain the geographical location of the device and query the database to determine if mobile communications device usage in a hands free state is permitted. Such embodiments provide access to communication features if the information obtained from the database indicates that usage of the device in the hands free state is permitted.

Certain embodiments may allow for emergency communications calls to be conducted regardless of the restrictions indicated by the database. Thus upon determining that the mobile communications device is used to place an emergency communications call the communication restrictions are prevented from being imposed.

It is worth noting that the placement of one or more of the steps in the method shown in may be different. For example detection of whether the mobile communications device is docked may occur before determining the speed or whether or not functions are to be controlled thereby avoiding the processing involved in these latter steps. Similarly other embodiments may not contain some of the steps shown in . For example as indicated step may be eliminated as some communication features such as texting may not be permitted even though the mobile communications device is in a hands free state.
