Embodiments generally relate to computer systems and more particularly to methods and systems for delivering report characterization information of a report.

Data visualization and data driven reporting is key to business. Usually these data visualizations or reports may be used by many users for different purposes. Some of these users may have questions that require report characterization information related to the data visualization or to the data report. Electronic viewing may sometime provide these report characterization information based on techniques such as section drill down. However these techniques require a smart report viewer such as Crystal Reports thick client viewer. In case the smart report viewer is not available the user cannot obtain the report characterization information related to the data visualization or the data report.

Embodiments of techniques for delivering report characterization information of a report are described herein. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment this embodiment and similar phrases means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

A report information source may store information related to the report . For example the report information source may store report metadata information such as the creation date of the report the name of persons creating the report etc. the report definition which may include the report objects in the report the grouping used in the report etc. the data provenance of the report data sources used for creating the report and the metadata of the data sources used for creating the report etc. The report information source may include a report file .rpt file of the report the data sources used for creating the report or any other files databases storing information related to the report . For example consider a sales report including the sales values of a company X for Q1 to Q4 of 2011. A sales report information source for the sales report may store the sales report metadata information such as creation date of the sales report Apr. 26 2012 an author of the sales report Bob Smith and the sales report s source metadata which includes the name of data source used for creating the sales report sales database etc.

Initially for inserting the report characterization information in the report the report characterization information is retrieved from the report information source . In one embodiment a pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula defined to retrieve the report characterization information from the report may be executed for retrieving the report characterization information from the report information source . In the above example a pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed to retrieve sales report metadata the creation date of the report Apr. 26 2012 and author of the report Bob Smith from the sales report information source. Next the retrieved report characterization information may be encoded to obtain a two dimensional barcode such as a QR Code a Quick Response code a data matrix code etc. A two dimensional barcode is an image based machine readable representation of data encoded by the barcode. The two dimensional barcode is an image based machine readable representation of the retrieved report characterization information . In the above example the retrieved sales report metadata creation date of the report Apr. 26 2012 and author of the report Bob Smith of the sales report is encoded to obtain a two dimensional barcode. Finally the two dimensional barcode may be inserted into the report to obtain a report . The obtained report represents the report with the report characterization information encoded in the form of a two dimensional barcode . In the above example the two dimensional barcode including the encoded sales report metadata is inserted into the report.

A user viewing a printed or an exported copy of the report may want to view the report characterization information of the report . In this case the user may use a device for example a smartphone with a two dimensional barcode reader application that scans and decodes the two dimensional barcode in the report to obtain the report characterization information . The obtained report characterization information may then be displayed on the smartphone of the user. Thus encoding the report characterization information in form of a two dimensional barcode and then inserting the two dimensional barcode in the report allows a user to view the report characterization information without using a smart report viewer. In the above example a user may receive the sales report with the two dimensional barcode as a hard copy or as an attachment of an E Mail. The user may use their phone s two dimensional barcode reader application to scan and decode the two dimensional barcode included in the report to obtain the report characterization information creation date of the report Apr. 26 2012 and author of the report Bob Smith related to the report which may then be displayed on the user s phone screen.

A report may represent information either in a graphical form chart graphs etc. or a non graphical form text tabular data etc. . In case the report represents information in a graphical form such as a chart the report designer may during designing the report selects an option insert a two dimensional barcode on chart to request insertion of the two dimensional barcode in the chart visual representation of information . Based on the request a placeholder image of a two dimensional barcode may be inserted automatically in the report. The placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode may be positioned layered above the top right or top left corner of the chart. The placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode may have standard width and height. In case the chart does not have enough space for inserting the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode then the placeholder image may not be inserted into the report and a pop up error message may be displayed to the report designer. On receiving the pop up error message the report designer may adjust the size of the chart such that the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode may be inserted into the report. Upon successful insertion the report designer may also adjust the size of the chart or the size of the two dimensional bar code such that the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode does not cover important parts of the report. In another embodiment if the report does not include a graphical representation of the information the report designer may select an insert the two dimensional code in the whole report option for requesting insertion of the two dimensional bar code. Based on the received request the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode may be inserted in a pre defined position such as a footer section of the report. The report designer may expand the footer section in case the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode does not fit in the footer section. For example consider a product ABC sales report that includes a chart illustrating the sales value of the product ABC in three countries USA Canada and Germany. A report designer designing the product ABC sales report may choose an option Add two dimensional barcode in the chart to request insertion of a two dimensional barcode in the chart. Based on the request a placeholder image of a two dimensional barcode may be inserted in the report.

In one embodiment a report characterization information retrieval formula may be provided for retrieving the report characterization information related to the report. The report characterization information retrieval formula related to the report may be a pre defined formula defined to retrieve the report characterization information which is to be included in the report. The pre defined information retrieval formula may be modified by the report designer. In one embodiment the report characterization information retrieval formula may be defined to retrieve the report characterization information which is to be encoded by the two dimensional barcode requested to be inserted in the report at block . In one embodiment the report characterization information includes additional information related to the report not included in the report. For example the report characterization information may include report s metadata such as data of creating modifying the report the name of the creator of the report etc. The report characteristic information may include information required to re create the report. For example the report information characterization information may include information about data source used for creating the report the Sequential Query Language SQL statements used in the report etc. The report characterization information retrieval formula may be a formula containing one or more expressions which define the report characterization information to be included in the report. In the above example a pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula may be Get data source Get SQL statement the expressions data source and SQL statement together define the report characterization information to be included in the report.

In one embodiment the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula may call functions which return the report characterization information report definition Structured Query Language SQL statements of the report and a data source s metadata which includes information about the data source used for creating the report . A report definition controls the appearance of the report and may include for example the report objects included in the report the definition of each section of the report and all fields within the section the tables used in the report the record and group selection criteria used for records and groupings respectively included in the report the formulas used in the report etc. The data source metadata may include the metadata information related to the data sources used for creating the report. For example the data source metadata may include information about the different data cleansing methods used for creating the report the name of the data source such as database table name used for creating the report etc. The SQL statements list the subset of data source tables from which the report is created and conditions for retrieving the data from these tables. The report characterization information retrieval formula may be defined to retrieve the report characterization information from different report information sources storing report information. For example the report characterization information retrieval formula may be defined to retrieve the report definition and the SQL statements from a report file .rpt file report information source which contains a record of the information used to generate the report. The report characterization information retrieval formula may also be defined to retrieve the data source metadata from the data sources report information source used for creating the report. In one embodiment applications for example SAP Business Object Information Steward refine retrieve and consolidate data source metadata information such as the Quality Score from different data sources which may then be provided to the report characterization information retrieval formula. The data source metadata information could include data lineage trust information metadata on usage and the like. This information is provided via various capabilities of the formula language.

Next at block a check may be performed to determine whether a request is received to modify a report characterization information retrieval formula. In one embodiment the request to modify the report characterization information retrieval formula may be received from the report designer. The obtained modified report characterization information retrieval formula may be defined to retrieve the modified report characterization information. In one embodiment the modified report characterization information is the report characterization information for example the report s definition the report s data source metadata the SQL statements used in the report etc. defined to be retrieved by the modified report characterization information retrieval formula. The report designer may modify the report characterization information retrieval formula by modifying the formula text included in the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula. In one embodiment the report characterization information retrieval formula may be modified by adding expressions to the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula using a report formula language. The added expression in the modified report characterization information retrieval formula refers to the new report information that the report designer wants to be included in the report. The report designer may include any valid report formula constructs in the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula for modifying the report characterization information retrieval formula. For example the report designer may add a formula construct GET creation date to the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula to obtain a modified report characterization information retrieval formula. The obtained modified report characterization information retrieval formula may be defined to retrieve the report characterization information defined by the pre defined report information retrieval formula and the report metadata referred by the formula construct GET report metadata . In one embodiment the report designer may add their decisions related to the creation of the report as a literal string I ignored the sales values for quarter that has a value less than 10k . The modified report characterization information may be stored in a report file. In the above example the report designer may modify the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula Get data source Get SQL statement to add a literal string IGNORE SALES VALUE OF ASIAN COUNTRIES in the report characterization information retrieval formula. The modified report characterization information retrieval formula Get data source Get SQL statement IGNORE SALES VALUE OF ASIAN COUNTRIES is defined to retrieve the data source of the sales report the SQL statements used in the sales report and to add the literal string IGNORE SALES VALUE OF ASIAN COUNTRIES in the report.

In case a request for modifying the report characterization information retrieval formula is not received condition in block is false then a check may be performed at block to determine whether a request is received for modifying the property of the two dimensional bar code which the report designer has requested to be inserted in the report at block . As a two dimensional bar code is a report object the two dimensional barcode may include the standard properties of a report object. For example the standard properties of the report object may include the color of the report object which a report designer may select according to their choice. In addition to the standard properties of the report object the two dimensional barcode which the designer wants to include the report may include some additional properties specific to the two dimensional barcode. For example an additional property of the two dimensional barcode report object may be suppress the two dimensional barcode if the report is being viewed in a rich client viewer property. In one embodiment the report designer may modify this property of the report object by setting it to true. After the report designer sets the suppress the two dimensional barcode if the report is not being viewed in a rich client viewer property to true the two dimensional barcode is not displayed when the report is viewed in a rich client viewer. In this example the bar code may still be rendered at print or export time.

In case a request for modifying the report characterization information retrieval formula and the property of the two dimensional barcode is not received that is the conditions in blocks and are both false then the blocks may be executed at run time when a report designer refreshes the report. Initially at block the report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed. In one embodiment the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed. The pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed to retrieve the report characterization information block . The report characterization information retrieval formula may retrieve the report characterization information from different report information sources such as report files data sources using for creating the report etc. In one embodiment executing the report characterization information retrieval formula includes evaluating the report characterization information retrieval formula. Evaluating the report characterization information retrieval formula includes replacing the formula s expressions with report characterization information. In the above example the report characterization information retrieval formula Get data source Get SQL statement may be executed to retrieve the report characterization information which includes the data source ABC sales database of the product ABC sales report and an SQL statement SELECT COUNTRY NAME SALE VALUE FROM ABC SALES of the product ABC sales report.

In one embodiment the report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed to retrieve the report characterization information of a portion of the report. In this case the report characterization information retrieval formula retrieves the report characterization information based on the context information of the portion of the report. The selected portion of the report may be an enclosed portion of the report selected by a user. The context information may be for example the relative position of the formula in the report. For example consider a report that includes two charts a first sales chart showing the sales of a product XYZ in different countries and a second sales chart showing the sale of product XYZ for quarter 1 to quarter 4. In this case the same report characterization information retrieval formula Get SQL may retrieve different SQL statements based on whether the report characterization information retrieval formula is positioned on the first sales chart or the second sales chart.

Next at block the report characterization information retrieved at block is encoded to obtain a two dimensional barcode. The encoded two dimensional barcode is an image based machine readable representation of the report characterization information retrieved at block . The report characterization information related to the report may be converted to text and the obtained text may then be encoded to obtain the two dimensional barcode. In one embodiment the obtained two dimensional barcode is a dynamic two dimensional barcode as the retrieved report characterization information encoded by the two dimensional barcode is not fixed and varies according to the report characterization information of the report. In one embodiment if the retrieved report characterization information is an SQL statement then the SQL statement may be converted to a relational algebra tree. The obtained relational algebra tree may then be encoded to obtain a two dimensional barcode. In the above example the report characterization information ABC sales database and the SQL statement SELECT COUNTRY NAME SALE VALUE FROM ABC SALES is encoded to obtain a two dimensional barcode which includes the encoded report characterization information.

Finally at block the obtained two dimensional barcode may be inserted to the report. In one embodiment inserting the two dimensional barcode in the report includes replacing the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode included in the report at block with the two dimensional barcode obtained at block . In the above example the obtained barcode may be inserted into the product ABC sales report by replacing the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode with the obtained two dimensional barcode.

In one embodiment if a request to modify the report characterization information retrieval formula is received condition in block is true then the blocks may be executed. The blocks may be executed at run time when the report designer refreshes the report. Initially at block the report designer may execute the modified report characterization information retrieval formula obtained at block . The modified report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed to retrieve the modified report characterization information block . The modified report characterization information related to the report may be retrieved from a report information source. In the above example the modified report characterization information retrieval formula Get data source Get SQL statement IGNORE SALES VALUE OF ASIAN COUNTRIES may be executed to retrieve the modified report characterization information ABC sales database the SQL statement SELECT COUNTRY NAME SALE VALUE FROM ABC SALES and IGNORE SALES VALUE OF ASIAN COUNTRIES related to the report.

Next at block the modified report characterization information retrieved at block may be encoded to obtain the modified two dimensional barcode. The obtained two dimensional barcode may store the retrieved report characterization information. In the above example the obtained modified two dimensional barcode may encode the modified report characterization information ABC sales database the SQL statement SELECT COUNTRY NAME SALE VALUE FROM ABC SALES and IGNORE SALES VALUE OF ASIAN COUNTRIES .

Finally at block the obtained modified two dimensional barcode may be inserted into the report. The obtained modified two dimensional barcode may be inserted into the report by replacing the placeholder image of the two dimensional barcode inserted to the report at block with the modified two dimensional barcode obtained at block . In the above example the modified two dimensional barcode may be inserted into the ABC sales report. In one embodiment processing continues at block the modified formula now included in the two dimensional barcode is generically called without loss of generality the formula in blocks .

In one embodiment if the request to modify the property of two dimensional barcode is received condition in block is true then the blocks may be executed. The blocks may be executed at run time when the report designer refreshes the report. In one embodiment the execution of the blocks may be similar to the execution of the blocks . Initially at block the pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed. The pre defined report characterization information retrieval formula may be executed to retrieve the report characterization information block . Next at block the retrieved report characterization information is encoded to obtain a two dimensional barcode which is then inserted into the report block . Finally at block the property of the inserted two dimensional barcode is modified based on the request received at block . In one embodiment the property of the inserted two dimensional barcode is changed by setting to true the modified property of the two dimensional barcode. For example the suppress the two dimensional barcode if the report is being viewed in a rich client viewer property of the two dimensional barcode may be set as true. Setting this property to true may result the two dimensional barcode inserted into the report at block being rendered only at print or export time. However when the report is being viewed in a rich client viewer such as Crystal Report the two dimensional barcode inserted in the report may not be displayed. This may allow the user an uncluttered viewing experience when the report is viewed in a rich client viewer.

Next at block a two dimensional barcode reader may scan the two dimensional barcode included in the report. A user may position a device for example a mobile phone with a two dimensional barcode reader application on the two dimensional barcode for scanning the two dimensional barcode included in the report. Based on the scanning the two dimensional barcode reader may decode the report characterization information encoded by the two dimensional barcode to obtain the report characterization information block . In the example above a user may scan the two dimensional barcode included in the report with their mobile phone s barcode reader application to obtain the report characterization information ABC sales database and the SQL statement SELECT COUNTRY NAME SALE VALUE FROM ABC SALES encoded in the two dimensional barcode.

Finally at block the report characterization information obtained at block may be displayed to the user. The obtained report characterization information may be displayed on the device used for scanning the two dimensional barcode. In the above example the report characterization information ABC sales database and the SQL statement SELECT COUNTRY NAME SALE VALUE FROM ABC SALES may be displayed on the mobile phone of the user providing the user a rich viewing experience of the printed ABC sales report.
