Service providers and device manufacturers e.g. wireless cellular etc. are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by for example providing compelling network services. One area of interest has been development of applications and services which process and or utilize various types of data in order to provide accurate appropriate and updated information. In particular these applications and services can include processing and analyzing data utilized for example by social networking services navigation services search engines content providers and the like. Traditionally data processing and analysis may be implemented via one or more servers or nodes and or clusters of servers or nodes that provide for instance distributed computing and or data storage to support the services. Moreover such data processing and analysis historically have been segregated based on whether the data being processed is slow moving data e.g. static or relatively static data that is collected over long periods of time such as user behavior data service usage information etc. processed by analytics systems or whether the data is collected as data streams in real time e.g. social networking feeds location tracking feeds etc. processed by stream processing systems . Each different type of data e.g. slow moving vs. real time has had different data processing architectures and techniques that traditionally have been used in isolation. As a result service providers and device manufacturers face significant technical challenges to managing and or integrating the data processing and analysis methods for slow moving data with the data processing and analysis methods for real time data.

Therefore there is a need for data processing methods to generate comprehensive results that combines the features of a slow moving data systems with real time data systems.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Examples of a method apparatus and computer program for smart data processing methods for more accurate and comprehensive results. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

To address at least these problems a system of introduces the capability for utilization of static and dynamic data analytics in various data processing mechanisms e.g. distributed and or local analytics engines . More specifically the system uses the static data of analytics engines with encapsulated computational chains e.g. by marshalling the encapsulated computations as data objects that are associated with and travel with the static data content . In one embodiment the encapsulated computational chains form the processing elements PEs of stream processing mechanisms. Because the encapsulated computational chains are marshalled as data these chains can be shaped by the analytics engines and then returned to the stream processing systems as PEs for processing real time data where marshalling may be considered as a process for transforming memory representation of an object to a data format e.g. similar to serialization suitable for storage and or transmission of the data to different components of a process and or from one process to another process. In some embodiments the real time processing systems may detect changes or trends in real time data streams and feed this information back to the analytics engines which can then update the marshalled computational chains of the PEs of the stream processing systems. Therefore the system provides a complete lifecycle of slow moving data analytics and fast moving data analytics.

In general users and service providers require various data features from various data processing and analysis mechanism which are capable of granular and scalable data features extraction attribute selection dataset fusion and lifting and the like. For initial stages of data processing one or more processes may need to detect and validate valuable features in a data set. Further features may be detected and extracted with entropy minimization approach when a stable state may indicate that a phase shift occurred e.g. binary data has been tagged meta data is created in order to represent binary etc. Furthermore granular and scalable data features extraction may be achieved by defining assumptions as to what is the abstraction level of data e.g. digital signals from sensors types of data models implied onto a sensory input binary data as second level above the signal data structured and semi structured data as third level and knowledge at fourth level. Additionally attributes may be selected by determining importance weights based and domain specific rules. Moreover dataset fusions and lifting may be accomplished by abstraction levels normalization levels fusion and lifting e.g. step functions .

In various embodiments of the system the data processing mechanisms e.g. engines pipelines etc. may include a dynamic stream processing e.g. real time or a near real time and a static processing e.g. map reduce batch jobs where the dynamic stream process may operate on one or more data feeds from various sources e.g. users service providers sensors etc. and the static process may operate on data from one or more databases e.g. historical data . The data feeds are sequences of objects mapped to contextual information e.g. geotag motion movement time etc. where the information may change over time and the historical data may include large volumes of contextual data collected from various sources over time e.g. hours days weeks etc. In various embodiments one or more service providers may utilize analytics from both processing mechanisms to further process and or utilize in providing various services to users and or to other service providers. In one embodiment a PE interface may analyze historical data in the static process and update e.g. correlate dataset and structure utilized in the dynamic stream process for a more comprehensive result. For example analytics based on a static process may determine and or indicate one or more trends e.g. location based event based etc. in a data feed wherein the data feed alone may not depict a complete status of the one or more trends. In one embodiment dynamic processing mechanism may process realtime data as well as historical data e.g. input as a stream replay . In one instance one or more data sets may be processed by the ETL according to various scripts which are shaping the map reduce mechanism.

In one embodiment the UE includes a location module sensor that can determine the UE location e.g. a user s location . The UE location can be determined by a triangulation system such as a GPS assisted GPS A GPS Cell of Origin wireless local area network triangulation or other location extrapolation technologies. Standard GPS and A GPS systems can use the one or more satellites to pinpoint the location e.g. longitude latitude and altitude of the UE . A Cell of Origin system can be used to determine the cellular tower that a cellular UE is synchronized with. This information provides a coarse location of the UE because the cellular tower can have a unique cellular identifier cell ID that can be geographically mapped. The location module sensor may also utilize multiple technologies to detect the location of the UE . GPS coordinates can provide finer detail as to the location of the UE . In another embodiment the UE may utilize a local area network e.g. WLAN connection to determine the UE location information for example from an Internet source e.g. a service provider .

In one embodiment the system determines at least one PE of at least one dynamic processing mechanism e.g. engine . In one embodiment a processing platform may include a dynamic process e.g. stream process which may operate on real time or near real time data stream to determine and or process one or more PEs. For example a PE may include computational code and or data which may be associated with one or more information items from a user and or a service provider e.g. a Twitter feed location based information etc. wherein the PEs may indicate a most common topic location hash tag and the like. In another example a PE may include data as well as executing code where one or more functions of a process may be defined e.g. process a counter determine occurrence of certain data patterns or popularity of a certain topic traffic analysis route planning reverse geocoding RGC etc. In one embodiment the processing platform may include a static process which may determine and or process the one or more PEs. For example the static process may preform one or more processes associated the one or more PEs one or more dynamic processes one or more distributed processes or a combination thereof. In one embodiment one or more other elements e.g. servers processors etc. of the system may determine and or process the one or more PEs instead of and or in conjunction with the processing platform the dynamic process and or the static process.

In one embodiment the system causes at least in part a marshalling of the at least one PE as at least one data object wherein the at least one data object is processable by at least one static processing mechanism. In one embodiment marshalling is a process of encoding an object for sharing sending and or communicating the object to one or more component processes and the like of a computer and or a network e.g. from a client to a server . In one embodiment the at least one static processing mechanism operates at least in part in a batch mode with a predetermined batch frequency and wherein the at least one dynamic processing mechanism the at least one PE or a combination thereof operate at least in part in substantially real time or at a frequency greater that the predetermined batch frequency.

In one embodiment the PE may include an executable code e.g. binary code which may be executing in the stream process wherein the data object may include information on the current process state execution steps e.g. snap shot of the state of the process values of variables and the like where the data object may continue to be processed at a different time and or in a different process e.g. static process .

In one embodiment the system processes and or facilitates a processing of at least substantially real time data via the at least one PE to determine one or more triggering events. In one embodiment the dynamic processor evaluates processes analyzes real time and or near real time data e.g. from users to determine one or more triggering events wherein the triggering events may be predetermined and or determined based on one or more criteria. For example the triggering event may be based on a location an event type a user profile a service provider and the like. In one embodiment the one or more triggering events include at least in part one or more contextual trends occurring above at least one threshold level. For example a threshold value may include a number of users a particular geographical location a certain communication topic and the like.

In one embodiment the system causes at least in part a transfer of the at least one data object to the at least one static processing mechanism based at least in part on the one or more triggering events. In one embodiment one or more triggering events e.g. an event at a certain geographical location may cause a PE interface to transfer one or more data objects to one or more static processing mechanisms e.g. batch jobs for utilization in one or more processes wherein the processing may be based at least in part on the information encapsulated in the data object and historical data available to the static processor.

In one embodiment the system causes at least in part an unmarshalling of the at least one processing element as at least one data object wherein the at least one data object is processable by the at least one static processing mechanism. In one embodiment and unmarshalling process is to decode the object that was marshalled. For example in a distributed computing environment an object is marshalled e.g. encoded serialized for sending the object from a client to a server side or from one process to another and an unmarshalling is a process to decode e.g. de serialize the encoded object at the receiving side.

In one embodiment the system processes and or facilitates a processing of the at least one data object via the at least one static processing mechanism to cause at least in part an updating of the at least one data object based at least in part on the one or more triggering events the one or more contextual trends or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment the triggering event and or the contextual trend may be determined from database e.g. historic data available to the static processing mechanism. For example a trend may indicate a movement of a plurality of users toward a particular location and or event wherein the data object may be updated to monitor and track the one or more trends based on one or more trends determined from for example historical data.

In one embodiment the system determines one or more computational chains one or more parameters of the one or more computational chains one or more data elements of the one or more computational chains or a combination thereof associated with the at least one PE wherein at least one data object includes at least in part the one or more computational chains the one or more parameters the one or more data elements or a combination thereof. In one embodiment encapsulated computational chains form PEs of stream processing mechanisms. In one embodiment the updating of the at least one data object comprises at least in part causing a shaping of the one or more computational chains based at least in part on the one or more triggering events the one or more contextual trends or a combination thereof. For example the shaping process may pass the PE as a data object to the static processing where it may update parameters computations and or re encode e.g. marshalling the updated computations parameters etc. back into data object for transmission to the dynamic process. In one embodiment shaping is determining which computational chains may be selected for the processing wherein one or more chains may be combined and encapsulated into one or more PEs for processing.

In one embodiment the system processes and or facilitates a processing of the at least one data object to cause at least in part an updating of one or more components of the at least one static processing mechanism. In one embodiment one or more new relationships and or trends may be determined from a data object for utilization in updating data and or one or more processes of the static process mechanism. In one instance one or more trends and or analytics from a data object may be utilized to cause an update to a static process for example to begin a process cycle outside of a predetermined schedule so to effectuate historical data and or process parameters for updated analytics.

In one embodiment the system causes at least in part an aggregation of one or more outputs of the at least one dynamic processing mechanism and the one or more other outputs of the at least one static processing mechanism. In one embodiment the PE interface aggregates output of the static process and the dynamic process. In one embodiment the PE interface may request a first output from a first processing mechanism e.g. the static process and then provide the first output to a second processing mechanism e.g. dynamic process wherein the second processing mechanism may aggregate the first output with an output from the second process.

In one embodiment the system determines one or more outputs of at least one processing job based at least in part on the aggregation. In one embodiment a processing mechanism e.g. a dynamic process a static process and or a PE interface may determine one or more outputs to one or more entities based at least in part on one or more aggregation of one or more outputs from one or more processing mechanisms. For example a processing mechanism element e.g. a server and or a service provider may utilize an aggregated output to provide an output to another element and or another service provider.

In one embodiment the processing platform the service providers and or the UEs may interact according to a client server model. It is noted that the client server model of computer process interaction is widely known and used. According to the client server model a client process sends a message including a request to a server process and the server process responds by providing a service. The server process may also return a message with a response to the client process. Often the client process and server process execute on different computer devices called hosts and communicate via a network using one or more protocols for network communications. The term server is conventionally used to refer to the process that provides the service or the host computer on which the process operates. Similarly the term client is conventionally used to refer to the process that makes the request or the host computer on which the process operates. As used herein the terms client and server refer to the processes rather than the host computers unless otherwise clear from the context. In addition the process performed by a server can be broken up to run as multiple processes on multiple hosts sometimes called tiers for reasons that include reliability scalability and redundancy among others.

By way of example the communication network of system includes one or more networks such as a data network a wireless network a telephony network or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN a public data network e.g. the Internet short range wireless network or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network e.g. a proprietary cable or fiber optic network and the like or any combination thereof. In addition the wireless network may be for example a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi wireless LAN WLAN Bluetooth Internet Protocol IP data casting satellite mobile ad hoc network MANET and the like or any combination thereof.

The UEs may be any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile device phone station unit device healthcare diagnostic and testing devices product testing devices multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer netbook computer tablet computer personal communication system PCS device personal navigation device personal digital assistants PDAs audio video player digital camera camcorder positioning device television receiver radio broadcast receiver electronic book device game device or any combination thereof including the accessories and peripherals of these devices or any combination thereof. It is noted that in the various embodiments described herein the term mobile device is used synonymously with UE mobile terminal mobile phone and or any other mobile device listed above. It is also contemplated that the UEs can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. Further the UEs may include various sensors for collecting data associated with a user a user s environment and or with a UE for example the sensors may determine and or capture audio video images atmospheric conditions device location user mood ambient lighting user physiological information device movement speed and direction and the like. In one embodiment the UE is a mobile device e.g. a handset a mobile phone etc. as described with respect to below.

By way of example processing platform the service providers and or the UEs may communicate with each other and other components of the communication network using well known new or still developing protocols. In this context a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node from generating and receiving physical signals of various types to selecting a link for transferring those signals to the format of information indicated by those signals to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Reference Model.

Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises 1 header information associated with a particular protocol and 2 payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols the packet includes 3 trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet its destination the length of the payload and other properties used by the protocol. Often the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks such as the Internet typically include a physical layer 1 header a data link layer 2 header an internetwork layer 3 header and a transport layer 4 header and various application layer 5 layer 6 and layer 7 headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.

In one embodiment the static process may utilize computational and data closures with an input point at and an output point at . The term computational closure refers to a particular data retrieval and computation procedure together with relations and communications among various processes including passing arguments sharing process results flow of data and process results etc. The computation closures e.g. a granular reflective set of instructions data and or related execution context or state provide the capability of slicing of computations and data for processes and transmitting the slices between devices infrastructures and processes.

In one embodiment the computation closures are marshalled as one or more data objects to facilitate transfer and processing among processing platforms e.g. static or slow moving data systems such as analytics engines and real time stream processing systems such as S4 systems . In one embodiment the closure marshalling may be generated and stored using Resource Description Framework RDF format. RDF is a family of World Wide Web Consortium W3C specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources using a variety of syntax formats. The underlying structure of any expression in RDF is a collection of triples each consisting of three disjoint sets of nodes including a subject a predicate and an object. A subject is an RDF URI reference U or a Blank Node B a predicate is an RDF URI reference U and an object is an RDF URI reference U a literal L or a Blank Node B . A set of such triples is called an RDF graph. Table 1 shows an example RDF graph structure.

The granularity may be achieved by the basic format of operation e.g. RDF within the specific computation environment. Furthermore the reflectivity of processes i.e. the capability of processes to provide a representation of their own behavior to be used for inspection and or adaptation may be achieved by encoding the behavior of the computation in RDF format. Additionally the context may be assumed to be partly predetermined and stored as RDF in the information space and partly be extracted from the execution environment. It is noted that the RDF structures can be seen as subgraphs RDF molecules i.e. the building block of RDF graphs or named graphs in the semantic information brokers SIBs of information spaces.

In certain embodiments marshalling the closures associated with a certain execution context enables the closures to be freely distributed among multiple components of the system including remote processors associated with the UEs and the processing platforms via the communication network . The processes of closure assigning and migration to run time environments may be performed based on a cost function which accepts as input variables for a cost determination algorithm those environmental or procedural factors that impact optimal processing capability from the perspective of the multiple UEs remote processors e.g. PEs processing platforms etc. associated therewith information space capacity etc. Such factors may include but are not limited to the required processing power for each process system load capabilities of the available run time environments processing required to be performed load balancing considerations security considerations latency service availability etc. As such the cost function is at least in part an algorithmic or procedural execution for evaluating weighing or determining the requisite operational gains achieved and or cost expended as a result of the differing closure assignment and migration possibilities. In one embodiment the assignment and migration process is performed in light of that which presents the least cost relative to environmental or functional conditions.

Further the map reduce process may utilize a process including extraction E transformation T and loading L wherein the extraction process includes extracting data from various data sources and the transformation stage includes series of rules or functions applied to the extracted data from the various sources in order to derive data for the loading stage wherein the data is loaded into an end target e.g. data warehouse service provider intermediate application etc. . In one embodiment the one or more PEs may be extracted from the dynamic processing engine and sent to the static processing e.g. extract transform and load ETL process as data objects for processing shaping e.g. creation of hierarchical or nested sets of record sets changing and or adjusting and after the processes the PEs are sent back to the dynamic process where the real time PEs may be correlated with the static e.g. historical data. For example the shaping process may pass the PEs as a data object to the static processing where it may update parameters computations and or re encode e.g. marshalling the updated computations parameters etc. back into data object for transmission to the dynamic process . In various embodiments the output of the static process is input to batch jobs results pool and output of the dynamic process is input to real time results pool wherein the results in the batch jobs results pool and in the real time results pool may be aggregated by one or more elements of the system and provided as an output to one or more elements e.g. service providers users intermediary applications etc. of the system .

In step the processing platform determines at least one PE of at least one dynamic processing mechanism e.g. engine . In one embodiment a processing platform may include a dynamic process e.g. stream process which may operate on real time or near real time data stream to determine and or process one or more PEs. For example a PE may include computational code and or data which may be associated with one or more information items from a user and or a service provider e.g. a Twitter feed location based information etc. wherein the PEs may indicate a most common topic location hash tag and the like. In another example a PE may include data as well as executing code where one or more functions of a process may be defined e.g. process a counter determine occurrence of certain data patterns or popularity of a certain topic traffic analysis route planning reverse geocoding RGC etc. In one embodiment the processing platform may include a static process which may determine and or process the one or more PEs. For example the static process may preform one or more processes associated the one or more PEs one or more dynamic processes one or more distributed processes or a combination thereof. In one embodiment one or more other elements e.g. servers processors etc. of the system may determine and or process the one or more PEs instead of and or in conjunction with the processing platform the dynamic process and or the static process.

In one embodiment the at least one static processing mechanism is associated with performing at least in part slow moving data analytics and wherein the at least one dynamic processing mechanism the at least one PE or a combination thereof are associated with performing at least in part fast moving data analytics.

In step the processing platform processes and or facilitates a processing of at least substantially real time data via the at least one PE to determine one or more triggering events. In one embodiment the dynamic processor evaluates processes analyzes real time and or near real time data e.g. from users to determine one or more triggering events wherein the triggering events may be predetermined and or determined based on one or more criteria. For example the triggering event may be based on a location an event type a user profile a service provider and the like. In one embodiment the one or more triggering events include at least in part one or more contextual trends occurring above at least one threshold level. For example a threshold value may include a number of users a particular geographical location a certain communication topic and the like.

In step the processing platform causes at least in part a transfer of the at least one data object to the at least one static processing mechanism based at least in part on the one or more triggering events. In one embodiment one or more triggering events e.g. an event at a certain geographical location may cause a PE interface to transfer one or more data objects to one or more static processing mechanisms e.g. batch jobs for utilization in one or more processes wherein the processing may be based at least in part on the information encapsulated in the data object and historical data available to the static processor.

Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit MCU a Digital Signal Processor DSP and a receiver transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of smart data processing for more accurate and comprehensive results. The display includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal e.g. mobile telephone . Additionally the display and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry includes a microphone and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone is fed to a coder decoder CODEC .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile terminal speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In one embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like or any combination thereof.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone any other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU .

The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .
