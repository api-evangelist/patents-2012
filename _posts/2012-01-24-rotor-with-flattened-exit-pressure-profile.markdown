title: Rotor with flattened exit pressure profile
abstract: A rotor blade comprises an airfoil extending radially from a root section to a tip section and axially from a leading edge to a trailing edge, the leading and trailing edges defining a curvature therebetween. The curvature determines a relative exit angle at a relative span height between the root section and the tip section, based on an incident flow velocity at the leading edge of the airfoil and a rotational velocity at the relative span height. In operation of the rotor blade, the relative exit angle determines a substantially flat exit pressure ratio profile for relative span heights from 75% to 95%, wherein the exit pressure ratio profile is constant within a tolerance of 10% of a maximum value of the exit pressure ratio profile.

This invention was made with government support under contract number NAS3 01138 awarded by NASA. The government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates generally to turbomachinery and specifically to turbine rotor components. In particular the invention concerns a fan or compressor rotor for a gas turbine engine.

Gas turbine engines or combustion turbines are built around a power core made up of a compressor combustor and turbine arranged in flow series with an upstream inlet and downstream exhaust. The compressor compresses air from the inlet which is mixed with fuel in the combustor and ignited to generate hot combustion gas. The turbine extracts energy from the expanding combustion gas and drives the compressor via a common shaft. Energy is delivered in the form of rotational energy in the shaft reactive thrust from the exhaust or both.

Gas turbine engines provide efficient reliable power for a wide range of applications including aviation and industrial power generation. Small scale engines including auxiliary power units typically utilize a one spool design with co rotating compressor and turbine sections. Larger scale jet engines and industrial gas turbines IGTs are generally arranged into a number of coaxially nested spools which operate at different pressures and temperatures and rotate at different speeds.

The individual compressor and turbine sections in each spool are subdivided into a number of stages which are formed of alternating rows of rotor blade and stator vane airfoils. The airfoils are shaped to turn accelerate and compress the working fluid flow and to generate lift for conversion to rotational energy in the turbine.

Ground based industrial gas turbines can be quite large utilizing complex spooling systems for increased efficiency. Power is delivered via an output shaft connected to an electrical generator or other mechanical load. Industrial turbines can also be configured for combined cycle operation in which additional energy is extracted from the exhaust stream for example using a low pressure steam turbine.

Aviation applications include turbojet turbofan turboprop and turboshaft engines. In turbojet engines thrust is generated primarily from the exhaust. Modern fixed wing aircraft generally employ turbofan and turboprop designs in which the low pressure spool is coupled to a propulsion fan or propeller. Turboshaft engines are typically used on rotary wing aircraft including helicopters.

Turbofan engines are commonly divided into high and low bypass configurations. High bypass turbofans generate thrust primarily from the fan which drives airflow through a bypass duct oriented around the engine core. This design is common on commercial aircraft and military transports where noise and fuel efficiency are primary concerns.

Low bypass turbofans generate proportionally more thrust from the exhaust flow providing greater specific thrust for use on supersonic fighters and other high performance aircraft. Unducted open rotor turbofans and ducted propeller configurations are also known and there are also counter rotating and aft mounted designs.

Turbofan engine performance depends on precise control of the working fluid flow including the pressure profile across each of the compressor and fan stages. Where engine noise and efficiency are factors they pose competing demands on fan and compressor blade design.

This invention concerns a rotor blade a rotor stage formed of a plurality of the rotor blades and a turbine engine utilizing the rotor stage. The rotor blade has a leading edge a trailing edge a root section and a tip section with an airfoil portion extending radially from the root section to the tip section and axially from the leading edge to the trailing edge.

The curvature of the airfoil is defined between the leading and trailing edges and at a relative span height between the root section and the tip section. In operation of the rotor blade the curvature determines a relative exit angle at the trailing edge based on the incident flow velocity at the leading edge and the rotational velocity of the blade at the relative span height. The relative exit angle determines a substantially constant exit pressure ratio profile for relative span heights from 75 to 95 within a tolerance of 10 of the maximum value of the exit pressure ratio profile.

Propulsion fan has a flattened exit pressure profile to decrease wake interactions with fan exit guide vanes reducing the noise profile of gas turbine engine and improving engine performance by better managing downstream vorticity in bypass duct . The flattened exit pressure profile is defined in terms of the pressure ratio across fan rotor using an aerodynamic blade geometry based on airfoil curvature and relative exit air angle to define the stagnation pressure ratio or total pressure head across fan rotor as described below.

In the two spool high bypass configuration of compressor section includes low pressure compressor LPC and high pressure compressor HPC . Turbine section comprises high pressure turbine HPT and low pressure turbine LPT .

Low pressure compressor is rotationally coupled to low pressure turbine via low pressure LP shaft forming the LP spool or low spool. High pressure compressor is rotationally coupled to high pressure turbine via high pressure HP shaft forming the HP spool or high spool.

In operation of gas turbine engine fan accelerates air flow from inlet through bypass duct generating thrust. The core airflow is compressed in low pressure compressor and high pressure compressor then mixed with fuel in combustor and ignited to generate combustion gas.

The combustion gas expands to drive high and low pressure turbines and which are rotationally coupled to high pressure compressor and low pressure compressor respectively. Expanded combustion gases exit through exhaust nozzle which is shaped to generate additional thrust from the exhaust gas flow.

In advanced turbofan designs low pressure shaft is coupled to fan via geared drive mechanism providing improved fan speed control for increased efficiency and reduced engine noise. Propulsion fan may also function as a first stage compressor for gas turbine engine with low pressure compressor performing as an intermediate stage compressor or booster. Alternatively the low pressure compressor stages are absent and air from fan is provided directly to high pressure compressor or to an independently rotating intermediate compressor spool.

Gas turbine engine thus encompasses a range of different shaft and spool geometries including one spool two spool and three spool configurations in both co rotating and counter rotating designs. Gas turbine engine may also be configured as a low bypass turbofan an open rotor turbofan a ducted or unducted propeller engine or an industrial gas turbine.

Fan and compressor noise contributions have both tonal and broadband components each with significance for gas turbine engine design. When the fan or compressor rotor is modified to flatten the exit pressure ratio wake interactions are decreased and the overall noise output is reduced. The size of the corresponding rotor stages can also reduced as compared to larger designs that would otherwise be required to lower the noise signature. The flattened fan exit pressure ratio profile of gas turbine engine may thus provide improved fuel efficiency with less noise while reducing engine size and weight.

A substantial component of engine noise is generated by fan particularly where the fan blade wakes interact with fan exit guide vanes . Noise during the takeoff and landing phases of flight has thus become a major driver in the design of gas turbine engines for aviation. In ultra high bypass ratio turbofans for example other jet noise sources may be substantially reduced making fan noise appear more pronounced as a relative contribution to the total noise output.

There are similar blade vane interactions in compressor or impeller section and aero derivative turbine components and design techniques are also used in other industries. Thus the flattened fan pressure ratio profiles described here have broad utility in both fan and compressor rotor design for aviation and ground based turbine engines including but not limited to turbofan engines turboprop engines and industrial gas turbines.

Rotor vane interaction noise stems from turbulent wake flows generated by upstream rotor stages which induce unsteady pressure gradients when they impinge on downstream vanes. The wake induced pressure patterns do not have to be circumferentially or radially non uniform to radiate noise but the mean unsteady flow is circumferentially non uniform resulting in increased noise. To address this problem airfoil sections S are designed with aerodynamic curvature to flatten the exit pressure ratio profile of rotor blade reducing noise contributions while maintaining rotor efficiency.

Flow on leading edge of airfoil is incident at absolute velocity V measured in the engine frame. Incident velocity Vmay be substantially axial or include axial radial and circumferential components. In flight applications the axial component of incident velocity Vmay include airspeed for example where airspeed results in an axial flow component onto the fan or compressor section of a turbofan or turboprop engine.

Relative incident velocity Wis measured in the frame of airfoil the rotor frame making angle with respect to incident velocity V as measured in the engine frame. Relative incident velocity Whas component W U along the rotational circumferential direction.

Flow exits trailing edge of airfoil at relative exit velocity W measured in the rotor fame. Relative exit velocity Wmakes angle with respect to axial component Vof exit velocity V and has circumferential component W. Absolute exit velocity Vis measured in the engine frame making angle with respect to axial component V with circumferential component V or C along the direction of rotation.

Relative air angle or relative exit angle is defined in the rotor frame between relative exit flow velocity Wand the axial direction at trailing edge of airfoil . Alternatively complementary relative angle is used where 90 .

Any of angles and may also be defined using other conventions either complementary or otherwise. In addition any differences in angle may be defined with either a positive or negative sense depending on the selected convention for angles and .

The dashed line in represents the reference airfoil of or B. The reference exit pressure ratio has a peak at approximately 75 span dropping off substantially by more than 10 between 75 and 90 span even more substantially by more than 30 toward 100 span see Table 1 . As seen by the downstream vanes these pressure patterns cause a non uniform velocity distribution along the corresponding span of the stator stage resulting in an increased angle of attack greater turbulent losses and more noise production.

The solid line in shows that aerodynamic blade curvature can define a relative exit angle profile with a flatter exit pressure profile. In one particular design the exit pressure ratio also increases monotonically across the full span of the blade including the outer 50 100 span remaining substantially flat across 75 100 span within a tolerance of 0.010.

This results in a more uniform pressure and velocity profile across the span of the blade reducing downstream turbulent losses and noise. Alternatively the pressure profile may decrease slightly at 90 100 span for example by less than 5 or less than 10 normalized or by less than 0.10 or less than 0.15 in the scaled absolute pressure ratio values in order to further improve performance.

The angular values in Table 1 have a nominal point to point tolerance of a tenth of a degree 0.1 with an absolute tolerance ranging up to one degree 1 or two degrees 2 depending on application and the corresponding tolerance in the selected pressure ratio. Alternatively the angular tolerance is one half degree 0.5 

Both normalized and absolute pressure ratio values are provided in Table 1 with a nominal point to point tolerance of 0.002. The absolute tolerance ranges from 0.05 0.10 and 0.15 to 0.20 or more depending on application and the corresponding tolerance in the selected air angle.

The normalized pressure ratios in Table 1 can be scaled to a one dimensional average of the values or based on a particular span location for example midspan. The absolute values are scaled to yield particular physical values of the actual pressure ratio as measured across a rotating blade for example using a scale factor of S 1.35 0.05. Other scale factors S range from about S 0.8 to about S 1.6 for example S 0.8 S 0.9 S 1.0 S 1.1 S 1.2 S 1.3 S 1.4 S 1.5 or S 1.6.

Relative angles or of airfoil are selected to achieve a uniform downstream pressure pattern with a flat exit pressure profile as compared to the reference blade. The exit pressure profile is defined by the physical blade geometry and does not depend on the convention used to measure the relative air or exit angles or other angular convention.

In particular the flat exit pressure profile of is determined by the aerodynamic design of airfoil as shown in . The aerodynamic design of airfoil in turn is determined by the curvature of camber lines C as defined along span height H including the corresponding chord length flow area and relative air angles or .

Thus the geometry of airfoil may be defined by the relative angle profile as given in Table 1 for various span heights between 0 and 100 . Alternatively the relative angle profile may be defined as a difference with respect to a reference airfoil or in terms of complementary angle .

Table 1 and provide particular examples of relative exit angles that determine the flat pressure profile of but other relative angle profiles may be used. The relative angles also vary within the stated tolerances and utilize different angular conventions. In addition the pressure ratio profile depends upon blade height and rotational velocity as described below.

Conversely the aerodynamic design of airfoil may be determined by the pressure ratio profiles of and the corresponding PR values in Table 1. In particular the pressure ratio determines the relative exit angle profile or for a given span height and rotational velocity based on the curvature of camber lines C. Note however that pressure ratios PR also vary within the stated tolerances and may be described in either normalized or absolute scaled terms.

Thus the geometry of airfoil may be defined either in terms of the relative exit angle or the pressure ratio profile as a function of the relative span height between 0 root section and 100 span tip section for a given range of blade height and rotational speeds. Due to endwall effects however the span range may be modified or limited to regions of well defined pressure ratios PR. Alternatively the span range is defined over particular portions of the for example the blade tip or midspan regions.

Thus the lower end of the span range may be defined from substantially 0 span or as a range extending from or above about 1 span about 2 span or about 5 span. Similarly the higher end of the span range may be defined up to substantially 100 span or as a range extending up to or below about 95 span 98 span or 99 span.

The midspan range may be defined at approximately 50 span or from about 25 to about 75 span. Other span ranges are also contemplated including any combination of particular relative span values provided in Table 1 along with the corresponding pressure ratios and relative angles and .

The flat pressure ratio profile design techniques described here are applicable to blades operated at subsonic transonic and supersonic speeds. Representative blade outer diameters range from 50 100 inches 127 254 cm or 25 50 inches 63 127 cm in height measured from the engine axis at full span. For shorter blades representative diameters range from about 30 50 inches 76 127 cm or 15 25 inches 38 64 cm in height from the engine axis. For longer blades representative diameters range up to 100 140 inches 254 356 cm or 50 70 inches 127 175 cm in height from the engine axis. Representative rotational speeds range from 2 000 6 000 RPM extending down to 1 000 3 000 RPM for longer blades and up to 5 000 10 000 RPM for shorter blades.
