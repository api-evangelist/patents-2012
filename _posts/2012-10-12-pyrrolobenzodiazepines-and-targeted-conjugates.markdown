This application is a national stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT US2012 059870 filed Oct. 12 2012 and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 547 195 filed Oct. 14 2011 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines PBDs in particular pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers having a C2 C3 double bond and an aryl group at the C2 position in each monomer unit and their inclusion in targeted conjugates.

Some pyrrolobenzodlazepines PBDs have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic anthramycin was discovered in 1965 Leimgruber et al. 87 5793 5795 1965 Leimgruber et al. 87 5791 5793 1965 . Since then a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported and numerous synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues Thurston et al. 1994 433 465 1994 Antonow D. and Thurston D. E. 2011 111 4 2815 2864 . Family members include abbeymycin Hochlowski et al. 40 145 148 1987 chicamycin Konishi et al. 37 200 206 1984 DC 81 Japanese Patent 58 180 487 Thurston et al. 26 767 772 1990 Bose et al. 48 751 758 1992 mazethramycin Kuminoto et al. 33 665 667 1980 neothramycins A and B Takeuchi et al. 29 93 96 1976 porothramycin Tsunakawa et al. 41 1366 1373 1988 prothracarcin Shimizu et al 29 2492 2503 1982 Langley and Thurston 52 91 97 1987 sibanomicin DC 102 Hara et al. 41 702 704 1988 Itoh et al. 41 1281 1284 1988 sibiromycin Leber et al. 110 2992 2993 1988 and tomamycin Arima et al. 25 437 444 1972 . PBDs are of the general structure 

They differ in the number type and position of substituents in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B ring there is either an imine N C a carbinolamine NH CH OH or a carbinolamine methyl ether NH CH OMe at the N10 C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an S configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B form DNA leading to a snug fit at the binding site Kohn In Springer Verlag New York pp. 3 11 1975 Hurley and Needham VanDevanter 19 230 237 1986 . Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove enables them to interfere with DNA processing hence their use as antitumour agents.

It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8 C hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker Bose D. S. et al. 114 4939 4941 1992 Thurston D. E. et al. 61 8141 8147 1996 . The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5 Pu GATC Py 3 interstrand cross link Smellie. M. et al. 42 8232 8239 2003 Martin. C. at al. 44 4135 4147 which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity. One example of a PBD dimmer SG2000 SJG 136 

has recently entered Phase II clinical trials in the oncology area Gregson S. et al. 44 737 748 2001 Alley M. C. et al. 64 6700 6706 2004 Hartley J. A. et al. 64 6693 6699 2004 .

More recently the present inventors have previously disclosed in WO 2005 085251 dimeric PBD compounds bearing C2 aryl substituents such as SG2202 ZC 207 

These compounds have been shown to be highly useful cytotoxic agents Howard P. W. et al. . 2009 19 22 6463 6466 doi 10.1016 j.bmcl.2009.09.012 .

Due to the manner in which these highly potent compounds act in cross linking DNA these molecules have been made symmetrically. This provides for straightforward synthesis either by constructing the PBD moieties simultaneously having already formed the dimer linkage or by reacting already constructed PBD moieties with the dimer linking group.

WO 2010 043880 discloses unsymmetrical dimeric PBD compound bearing aryl groups in the C2 position of each monomer where one of these aryl groups bears a substituent designed to provide an anchor for linking the compound to another moiety. Co pending International application PCT US2011 032664 filed 15 Apr. 2011 discloses the inclusion of these PBD dimer compounds in targeted conjugates.

The present inventors have developed further unsymmetrical dimeric PBD compounds for inclusion in targeted conjugates where the substituents on the C2 aryl group not bearing the anchor for linking the compound to another moiety are different to those previously described. These differing substituent groups may offer advantages in the preparation and use of the compounds particularly in their biological properties and the synthesis of conjugates and the biological properties of these conjugates.

In other embodiments the protecting groups may be orthogonal to other protecting groups in the molecule where present.

Suitable protecting groups for amino acid side chains include those groups described in the Novabiochem Catalog 2006 2007. Protecting groups for use in a cathepsin labile linker are also discussed in Dubowchik et al.

In certain embodiments of the invention the group Lincludes a Lys amino acid residue. The side chain of this amino acid may be protected with a Boc or Alloc protected group. A Boc protecting group is most preferred.

The chemical protecting group may be removed to provide a functional group to form a connection to a Ligand unit. Optionally this functional group may then be converted to another functional group as described above.

In one embodiment the active group is an amine. This amine is preferably the N terminal amine of a peptide and may be the N terminal amine of the preferred dipeptides of the invention.

The active group may be reacted to yield the functional group that is intended to form a connection to a Ligand unit.

Examples of those antigens known in the art include but are not limited to those tumour associated antigens set out in WO 2005 082023. See for instance pages 41 55.

In some embodiments the conjugates are designed to target tumour cells via their cell surface antigens. The antigens may be cell surface antigens which are either over expressed or expressed at abnormal times or cell types. Preferably the target antigen is expressed only on proliferative cells preferably tumour cells however this is rarely observed in practice. As a result target antigens are usually selected on the basis of differential expression between proliferative and healthy tissue.

The cysteine residues of the Ligand unit may be available for reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit to form a connection. In other embodiments for example where the Ligand unit is an antibody the thiol groups of the antibody may participate in interchain disulfide bonds. These interchain bonds may be converted to free thiol groups by e.g. treatment of the antibody with DTT prior to reaction with the functional group of the Linker unit.

Similarly a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form O a salt or solvate thereof as well as conventional protected forms.

It may be convenient or desirable to prepare purify and or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound for example a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al. 66 1 19 1977 .

For example if the compound is anionic or has a functional group which may be anionic e.g. COOH may be COO then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include but are not limited to alkali metal ions such as Na and K alkaline earth cations such as Caand Mg and other cations such as Al. Examples of suitable organic cations include but are not limited to ammonium ion i.e. NH and substituted ammonium ions e.g. NHR NHR NHR NR . Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from ethylamine diethylamine dicyclohexylamine triethylamine butylamine ethylenediamine ethanolamine diethanolamine piperazine benzylamine phenylbenzylamine choline meglumine and tromethamine as well as amino acids such as lysine and arginine.

Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include but are not limited to those derived from the following polymeric acids tannic acid carboxymethyl cellulose.

It may be convenient or desirable to prepare purify and or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term solvate is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute e.g. active compound salt of active compound and solvent. If the solvent is water the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate for example a mono hydrate a di hydrate a tri hydrate etc.

The invention includes compounds where a solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol ROH where Ris Calkyl 

These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms of the PBD. The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found as well as the nature of the moiety itself.

Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric optical enantiomeric diasteriomeric epimeric atropic stereoisomeric tautomeric conformational or anomeric forms including but not limited to cis and trans forms E and Z forms c t and r forms endo and exo forms R S and meso forms D and L forms d and l forms and forms keto enol and enolate forms syn and anti forms synclinal and anticlinal forms and forms axial and equatorial forms boat chair twist envelope and halfchair forms and combinations thereof hereinafter collectively referred to as isomers or isomeric forms .

Note that except as discussed below for tautomeric forms specifically excluded from the term isomers as used herein are structural or constitutional isomers i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space . For example a reference to a methoxy group OCH is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer a hydroxymethyl group CHOH. Similarly a reference to ortho chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer meta chlorophenyl. However a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class e.g. Calkyl includes n propyl and iso propyl butyl includes n iso sec and tert butyl methoxyphenyl includes ortho meta and para methoxyphenyl .

The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms for example keto enol and enolate forms as in for example the following tautomeric pairs keto enol illustrated below imine enamine amide imino alcohol amidine amidine nitroso oxime thioketone enethiol N nitroso hyroxyazo and nitro aci nitro.

Note that specifically included in the term isomer are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example H may be in any isotopic form including H H D and H T C may be in any isotopic form including C C and C O may be in any isotopic form including O and O and the like.

Unless otherwise specified a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms including wholly or partially racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation e.g. asymmetric synthesis and separation e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein or known methods in a known manner.

The compounds of the present invention where Rand Rform a nitrogen carbon double bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms to which they are bound can be synthesised from a compound of Formula 2 

The compound produced may be in its carbinolamine or carbinolamine ether form depending on the solvents used. For example if Protis Troc and Protis an oxygen protecting group for synthesis then the deprotection is carried out using a Cd Pb couple to yield the compound of formula I . If Protis SEM or an analogous group and Protis an an oxo group then the oxo group can be removed by reduction which leads to a protected carbinolamine intermediate which can then be treated to remove the SEM protecting group followed by the elimination of water. The reduction of the compound of Formula 2 can be accomplished by for example superhydride or lithium tetraborohydride whilst a suitable means for removing the SEM protecting group is treatment with silica gel.

The couplings described above are usually carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst for example Pd PPh Pd OCOCH PdCl Pd dba . The coupling may be carried out under standard conditions or may also be carried out under microwave conditions.

The two coupling steps are usually carried out sequentially. They may be carried out with or without purification between the two steps. If no purification is carried out then the two steps may be carried out in the same reaction vessel. Purification is usually required after the second coupling step. Purification of the compound from the undesired by products may be carried out by column chromatography or ion exchange separation.

In some embodiments of the invention particularly where Rbears a substituent that is OH or COH it may be desired in the above methods to add an organometallic derivative of Rwhere the substituent group is protected. For example if Rbears COH it may be preferred to join a compound where the carboxy is protected as an ester e.g. Calkyl ester and then deprotect the carboxy group at a later stage in the synthesis. It may even be deprotected once part of the linker group for making a drug linker has been added. The OH substituent may be protected by phenol protecting groups as known in the art.

Conjugates comprising PBD dimers as described herein can be prepared using the knowledge of the skilled artisan in combination with the teachings provided herein. For example linkers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 214 345 U.S. Pat. No. 7 498 298 as well as WO 2009 0117531 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes. Other linkers can be prepared according to the references cited herein or as known to the skilled artisan.

Linker Drug compounds can be prepared according to methods known in the art in combination with the teachings provided herein. For example linkage of amine based X substituents of the PBD dimer Drug unit to active groups of the Linker units can be performed according to methods generally described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 214 345 and 7 498 298 and WO 2009 0117531 or as otherwise known to the skilled artisan. Some examples are shown below.

Antibodies can be conjugated to Linker Drug compounds as described in Doronina et al. Nature Biotechnology 2003 21 778 784 . Briefly antibodies 4 5 mg mL in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride TCEP at 37 C. The progress of the reaction which reduces interchain disulfides is monitored by reaction with 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0 C. and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug linker per antibody thiol. After 1 hour the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD 10 column. The ADC is then sterile filtered through a 0.22 m syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm respectively with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation and RP HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC quenched drug linker.

Antibodies with introduced cysteine residues can be conjugated to Linker Drug compounds as described in International Patent Publication WO2008 070593 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes or as follows. Antibodies containing an introduced cysteine residue in the heavy chain are fully reduced by adding 10 equivalents of TCEP and 1 mM EDTA and adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1M Tris buffer pH 9.0 .

Following a 1 hour incubation at 37 C. the reaction is cooled to 22 C. and 30 equivalents of dehydroascorbic acid is added to selectively reoxidize the native disulfides while leaving the introduced cysteine in the reduced state. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 with 1M Tris buffer pH 3.7 and the reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22 C. The pH of the solution is then raised again to 7.4 by addition of 1 M Tris buffer pH 9.0 . 3.5 equivalents of the PBD drug linker in DMSO is placed in a suitable container for dilution with propylene glycol prior to addition to the reaction. To maintain solubility of the PBD drug linker the antibody itself is first diluted with propylene glycol to a final concentration of 33 e.g. if the antibody solution was in a 60 mL reaction volume 30 mL of propylene glycol was added . This same volume of propylene glycol 30 mL in this example is added to the PBD drug linker as a diluent. After mixing the solution of PBD drug linker in propylene glycol is added to the antibody solution to effect the conjugation the final concentration of propylene glycol is 50 . The reaction is allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and then quenched by addition of 5 equivalents of N acetyl cysteine. The ADC is purified by ultrafiltration through a 30 kD membrane. Note that the concentration of propylene glycol used in the reaction can be reduced for any particular PBD as its sole purpose is to maintain solubility of the drug linker in the aqueous media. 

For halo acetamide based Linker Drug compounds conjugation can be performed generally as follows. To a solution of reduced and reoxidized antibodies having introduced cysteines in the heavy chain in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTPA is added 0.5 volumes of propylene glycol. A 10 mM solution of acetamide based Linker Drug compound in dimethylacetamide is prepared immediately prior to conjugation. An equivalent amount of propylene glycol as added to the antibody solution is added to a 6 fold molar excess of the Linker Drug compound. The dilute Linker Drug solution is added to the antibody solution and the pH is adjusted to 8 8.5 using 1 M Tris pH 9 . The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed for 45 minutes at 37 C. The conjugation is verified by reducing and denaturing reversed phase PLRP S chromatography. Excess Linker Drug compound is removed with Quadrasil MP resin and the buffer is exchanged into 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 50 mM NaCl and 5 propylene glycol using a PD 10 desalting column.

The following schemes are illustrative of routes for synthesising drug linkers the PBD dimer is shown with specific substituents and dimer links but these may be varied within the scope of the present invention.

The glucuronide linker intermediate S1 reference Jeffrey et al. 2006 17 831 840 can be treated with diphosgene in dichlroromethane at 78 C. to afford the glucuronide chloroformate which is then reacted with the PBD dimer S2 dissolved in CHClby dropwise addition. Warming the reaction to 0 C. over 2 hours followed by extraction will yield the compound S3. Treating a solution of S3 in an equal solvent mixture of MeOH tetrahydrofuran and water cooled to 0 C. with lithium hydroxide monohydrate for 4 hours followed by reaction with glacial acetic acid will yield the compound S4. Adding maleimidocaproyl NHS ester to a solution of S4 in DMF followed by diisopropylethylamine and stirring at room temperature under nitrogen for 2 hours will yield the desired drug linker S5.

This approach could also be used with PBD dimers containing aliphatic amines such as benzylamine e.g. S6 

The methods of Examples 2 and 3 could also be applied to a wide variety of the PBD dimers of the present invention in order to introduce peptidic linkers.

Antibodies with introduced cysteines Antibodies to CD70 containing a cysteine residue at position 239 of the heavy chain were fully reduced by adding 10 equivalents of TCEP and 1 mM EDTA and adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1M Tris buffer pH 9.0 . Following a 1 hour incubation at 37 C. the reaction was cooled to 22 C. and 30 equivalents of dehydroascorbic acid were added to selectively reoxidize the native disulfides while leaving cysteine 239 in the reduced state. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 with 1M Tris buffer pH 3.7 and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22 C. The pH of the solution was then raised again to 7.4 by addition of 1 M Tris buffer pH 9.0 . 3.5 equivalents of the PBD drug linker in DMSO were placed in a suitable container for dilution with propylene glycol prior to addition to the reaction. To maintain solubility of the PBD drug linker the antibody itself was first diluted with propylene glycol to a final concentration of 33 e.g. if the antibody solution was in a 60 mL reaction volume. 30 mL of propylene glycol was added . This same volume of propylene glycol 30 mL in this example was then added to the PBD drug linker as a diluent. After mixing the solution of PBD drug linker in propylene glycol was added to the antibody solution to effect the conjugation the final concentration of propylene glycol is 50 . The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and then quenched by addition of 5 equivalents of N acetyl cysteine. The ADC was then purified by ultrafiltration through a 30 kD membrane. Note that the concentration of propylene glycol used in the reaction can be reduced for any particular PBD as its sole purpose is to maintain solubility of the drug linker in the aqueous media. 

Cells as detailed below were collected and plated in 96 well black sided plates at a density of 10 000 cells well in 150 L of medium. Serial dilutions of the test article 50 L were added and incubation was carried out for 92 hours at 37 C. After addition of test compound cultures were incubated to 96 hours at 37 C. Resazurin 0.25 mM 50 L Sigma St. Louis. Mo. in medium was added and incubation was continued for 4 hours. The plates were read on a Fusion HT microplate reader Packard Meriden Conn. using an excitation wavelength of 525 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Data from all assays were reduced using GraphPad Prism Version 4 for Windows GraphPad Software San Diego Calif. . The ICconcentrations compared to untreated control cells were determined using a 4 parameter curve fits.

The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the selected antibody drug conjugates was assessed using a resazurin Sigma St. Louis Mo. USA reduction assay reference Doronina et al. 2003 21 778 784 . The antibody drug conjugates were prepared as described above in Example 6.

For the 96 hour assay cells cultured in log phase growth were seeded for 24 hours in 96 well plates containing 150 L RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 FBS. Serial dilutions of ADC in cell culture media were prepared at 4 working concentration 50 L of each dilution was added to the 96 well plates. Following addition of ADC the cells were incubated with test articles for 4 days at 37 C. Resazurin was then added to each well to achieve a 50 M final concentration and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 hours at 37 C. The plates were then read for the extent of dye reduction on a Fusion HT plate reader Packard Instruments Meridien Conn. USA with excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 and 590 nm respectively. The ICvalue determined in triplicate is defined here as the concentration that results in a 50 reduction in cell growth relative to untreated controls.

Referring to the tables below the in vitro cytotoxicity of ADCs using the 96 hour assay is shown. The ADCs were tested against antigen positive and antigen negative cell lines.

All studies were conducted in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee in a facility that is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. ADC tolerability was first assessed to ensure that the conjugates were tolerated at the doses selected for the xenograft experiments. BALB c mice were treated with escalating doses of ADC formulated in PBS with 0.5 M arginine and 0.01 Tween 20. Mice were monitored for weight loss and outward signs of morbidity following treatment those that experienced greater than 20 weight loss or displayed signs of morbidity were euthanized. The antibody used was a CD70 antibody humanized h1F6 WO2006 113909 with a point mutation substituting cysteine for serine at position 239. Conjugation to the Drug Unit is through the introduced cysteine at position 239. An average of 2 drugs is loaded per antibody.

In vivo therapy experiments were conducted in xenograft models in mice bearing CD70 renal cell carcinoma or non Hodgkin lymphoma. Tumor fragments were implanted into nude mice. Mice were then randomized to study groups with each group averaging around 100 mm. The ADCs were administered according to the schedule indicated. Tumor volume as a function of time was determined using the formula L W 2. Animals were euthanized when tumor volumes reached 1000 mm. Mice showing durable regressions were terminated around day 100 post implant.

The results of a mouse tolerability experiment with h1F6ec 6 nominally loaded at 2 drugs mAb demonstrated that a single dose of 1 mg kg was well tolerated with no weight loss or signs of outward morbidity out to 30 days. Administration of a higher dose 2.5 mg kg resulted in weight loss.
