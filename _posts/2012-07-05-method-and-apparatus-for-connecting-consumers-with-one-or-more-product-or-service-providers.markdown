This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 053 869 filed on Mar. 22 2011 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 381 235 filed on Sep. 9 2010 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 316 695 filed on Mar. 23 2010 the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entireties.

The disclosed embodiments relate to generating a system and interface for connecting a product or service provider and a consumer in search of or in need of such product or service.

Coventional Information sites e.g websites software applications computing devices etc. exist for individuals and consumers to offer goods and services for sale at their standard or discounted price or at a price determined using an auction or variable pricing system. However often consumers spend time seeking a service provider or entity to buy goods or obtain services by searching on line or using a telephone directory. In this manner consumers often have to spend considerable time and effort to contact several service providers via information sites or telephone to obtain an acceptable price and availability from the goods or service providers. They also are forced to search using Internet search engines or generic websites that offer multiple types of products with the hope that a product or service provider who carries the product they are looking for will show up in a search result under the search terms they are looking for and that the product or service provider presented will have the product at the price they are willing to pay and be in a relevant geographic areas.

Additionally Service Providers and product or service providers spend time and resources in an effort to attract consumers for their products and services via advertising. Current advertising methods such as television radio and conventional online advertising while effective in presenting information to large groups of potential buyers based on traditional demographic criteria such as general geograhic location and in the case of internet search engines particular topics of interest indicated by the search they still are not efficient. These methods require the buyer of a product or service provider s products to be exposed to the specific advertising for which that product or service provider has paid. In the scenario of internet advertising a product or service provider s potential consumer perform a search for a term or group of terms that will return that product or service provider as part of a paid or unpaid search result on an internet search engine or visit a particular website displaying advertising from that product or service provider.

In the event that a product or service provider does chose to develop an online advertising campaign the product or service provider must now spend resources to manage that campaign and entice viewers to visit their website through the use of limited advertising text hyperlinks and advertising banners. If the consumer does select the product or service provider s advertisement it is then up to the product or service provider s website to convert the passive searcher into a consumer with effective online lead generation which differs in effectiveness by industry and from product or service provider to product or service provider . Additionally not all current methods of online advertising account for window shoppers or users who click on the wrong link both of which cost the advertiser money. As most product or service providers do not specialize in web design the product or service provider s conversion rate becomes a secondary problem once a potential consumer has selected the product or service provider s website. A high conversion rate can reduce the cost per acquisition while a low conversion rate will increase the cost per acquisition.

Ultimately regardless of the a product or service provider s ability to maintain or afford conventional methods of advertising for purposes of consumer acquisition that advertising is expensive and does not allow the product or service provider to exactly target or reach their preferred clients. Moreover these conventional methods rely on the consumer being exposed to that product or service provider and selecting to work with or purchase from that particular product or service provider which can be cost prohibitive for most small to medium product or service providers.

The less traditional or common place method of client acquisition is through purchasing of Leads. Leads are generally considered consumer contact information and limited information about their interest or needs which have been generated by some source such as a survey contact form or an account created when purchasing some other service . This method while allowing for direct access to consumers does not necessarily ensure that the consumer a is expecting to be contacted by a particular product or service provider b is interested in a product or service providers specific product s or industry c is a client that matches a particular product or service provider s specific criteria or d has not been contacted by numerous other product or service providers who acquired their contact information thereby devaluing any contact by a particular product or service provider. Conversely from the consumer s perspective this method relies on all parties who have access to their contact information to 1 keep it secure 2 ensure their privacy is maintained 3 provide their information to only the people they desire and 4 only share their information with persons or entities they specifically authorize. These conventional methods also require consumers if they are interested in multiple products to produce multiple leads thereby reducing any current practical implementation to little more than online versions of Classified Wanted Ads . Additionally once a consumer has submitted their information they do not necessarily have any knowledge of by whom it is received.

A method and apparatus that for matching consumers with product or service providers is disclosed. The method may include establishing one or more profiles from one or more product or service providers establishing one or more profiles from one or more consumers receiving a consumer s subject matter request matching the consumer with one or more products or service providers based on at least one of the consumer s profile and subject matter request and providing the consumer s contact information to the matched one or more products or service providers.

Additional features and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the disclosed embodiments. The features and advantages of the disclosed embodiments may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosed embodiments will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or may be learned by the practice of the disclosed embodiments as set forth herein.

Various embodiments of the disclosed embodiments are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without parting from the spirit and scope of the disclosed embodiments.

The disclosed embodiments may comprise a variety of embodiments such as a method and apparatus and other embodiments that relate to the basic concepts of the disclosed embodiments.

This disclosed embodiments may concern an apparatus and method for providing product or service providers with a targeted and relevant list of potential consumers and enabling product or service providers and consumers to connect directly. More particularly the disclosed embodiments may relate to a Pay for Profile method of consumer targeting and acquisition which reverses the traditional process and allows the consumer to be specific with their desired product or service criteria and therefore the product or service provider can more closely match their offers to the desires of the consumer. Product or service providers may pay for access to a consumers profile that meets their criteria and may not pay for consumers that do not meet their criteria or that have selected the product or service provider accidently while performing a search.

 Pay for profile may apply market principles to advertising on the Internet. Conventional Internet applications are passive and do not provide a platform for a product or service provider to take a proactive approach. Conventional internet applications also do not allow consumers to post profiles in order to have product or service providers offer their products or services directly to them in a controlled format. Pay for Profile may enable product or service providers to more accurately target internet users that meet their criteria and focus resources on their best possible consumer. Furthermore a competitive consumer selection process may be based on a cost per acquisition price per click consumer price point number of previous clicks time posted and area of interest to helps ensure that the pricing structure reflects the market and is accessible to product or service providers regardless of their websites efficiency or the product or service provider s particular marketing budget.

Combining consumer generated profiles and lead purchasing is not commonplace. There is a need to provide a method and apparatus which can combine consumer generated profiles and lead purchasing through one s own website or third party website combined with a method and apparatus to charge the product or service provider per access of the profile while also allowing for the possibility of consumer interaction with the profile and maintaining of consumer privacy.

The proposed disclosed system and method may also concern gathering information concerning products and or services needed from a consumer posting that information which may collectively be considered a profile lead or contact information using a public or member based presentation forum e.g. a website application page intranet etc. and then providing commercial entities or other consumers the ability to access all or portions of the profile to offer their goods and or services through the intermediary presenter e.g. the website application page intranet etc. to review data for consumer research purposes and to purchase contact information for the purpose of resale.

Consumer profiles may be created and updated automatically or by the consumer through an interaction with an application or website. Profiles may not be limited to contact information of a single individual or entity.

The profile could contain both default or automatically generated values for any particular information contained in the profile. The profile may contain multiple sub profiles within it. Each sub profile may contain information unique to that sub profile or duplicate information inherited from other profiles sub profiles and parent profile. A profile may contain any information relevant to a consumer or a potential product or service provider. Examples of information contained in the profile may be contact information of the consumer geographic information relevant to the consumer parameters regarding product or service price features brands color manufacture safety ratings and consumer ratings the general description of a desired product how many times a profile may be accesses and particular product or service providers or distributors that may or may not be authorized to contact this consumer. Profiles may also contain the source of the profile system information about the consumer such as the consumer s operating system OS or internet protocol IP address history of websites visited and any other information that maybe collected automatically during creation of the profile.

Profiles may also be associated with particular channels which could include industries particular categories of products or manufactures.

Consumer may update all or part of the information in a profile. Examples of information consumers may change within a profile are narrowing or expanding of product criteria general description channels with which to associate their profiles number of clicks their profile may receive number of views their profile or portion of a profile may receive where and when and to whom the profile is presented as well as any related privacy setting such as name or contact information available to product or service provider.

The consumer may pay be paid receive discounts points coupons or any other monitory or non monitory incentive for creating or interacting with a profile. Or the service may be free to the consumer and they may receive no benefit for creating a profile.

The consumers who are associated with profiles may also be compensated in the form of a discount when they purchase a product or service through a particular retailer. This type of special discount may also leverage the collective buying power of groups. Either user created or determined by the respective information site consumers who are all interested in the same product could all receive select discounts from product or service providers who offer incentives based on the number of people interested in buying at that time.

Product or service providers may not be exclusively limited to individuals or entities selling products and could include any entity individual program code that accesses a profile.

The product or service provider may pay be paid participate as a member of a collective or the service may be free to the product or service provider. Membership may be required or the service may be a free or open source platform that allows product or service providers or users access to all or some of the profiles.

The product or service providers may create an account in the system however an account may not be required. Product or service providers may access and use their account to select profiles to view based on search terms that are relevant to the products and services offered by the product or service provider a particular budget they have established for selecting profiles or other criteria unrelated to the products they offer but related to purchasers of their products such as gender.

In would be assumed that the less time that passes between when a consumers requests a product or service and when the product or service provider accesses the profile of that consumer to offer them products the greater the chances of doing business with that consumer. For this reason the product or service provider may also be able to setup methods for automatically accessing profiles that meet a particular set of criteria or could integrate accessing of profiles with any other consumer targeting systems already in use by a product or service provider such as auto responder emails.

Product or service providers may also set up daily budgets with filter criteria similar to a CPC campaign budget where filters are set and all profiles are automatically accessed or available to be select that meet their product or service provider s criteria until the budget is exhausted for example.

Product or service provider profiles may also store previously accessed consumer profiles for reference tracking or client management purposes. This could also be used to ensure product or service providers are not charged for accessing the same profile over again unless it was updated.

Product or service providers may access profiles through any number of interfaces or platforms such as website computer applications or mobile devices software application RSS feed or any program code designed to retrieve profiles or portions of information included within a profile.

Upon access of a profile a product or service provider may be billed or charged. Upon access of the profile the product or service provider may be provided with or provided a method to access the available portion of the accessed profile based on the platform through which it was accessed or other criteria determined by the system and information inside the profile.

Information provided from the profile to a product or service provider may be provided immediately or could be stored in or associated with the Product or service provider s Account for later retrieval or other cross reference proposes.

The product or service provider s selection of a profile may result in an access request being sent to the system for the consumer s profile and a response by the system transmitting the consumers profile information to the product or service provider.

The product or service provider may only be charged when the consumer is selected by the product or service provider either through a manual selection process an automated selection process with the product or service providers preset criteria an automated process based on criteria set by the system or any combination of methods or means by which the system is able to match a consumer profile with a product or service provider.

One possible method of monetizing this system may be by implementing a Pay per Click PPC system. However rather than costing the advertiser some amount of money every time a person e.g. the person seeking goods and or services in this case otherwise known as the consumer clicks on a promotional link the person offering to provide the goods and or services a professional may be charged per profile accessed.

One possible method for determining amount of money charged to product or service providers per profile accessed may be assigning a value to each profile based on general or specific criteria. Examples that could determine or be combined to determine criteria could be number previous clicks or times the profile or portion of the profile was accessed geographic location of the consumer geographic location of the consumer relative to the product or service provider date of the consumer s request last time the profile was updated specific product or service providers that have previously accessed the profile relative to the current product or service provider exclusive vs. non exclusive the particular product or service provider accessing the profile criteria set by the system criteria set by the user. Furthermore valuation may be influenced by profiles previously contacted by the product or service provider or the proportional benefit the product or service provider could receive based on the benefit the product or service provider would see from a transaction with this consumer.

This system may also be developed to use a Cost Per Acquisition CPA Period Based Subscription Auction Fixed Fee Commodity Market or any other model or combination of models suitable for accountability and revenue generation 

Profiles may be searched and accessed via multiple platforms that interface with the system. Searches may be performed based on any number of criteria or methods. Searches may not be limited to manual input of criteria by a user. Searches may be preformed automatically based on manual input of criteria by a user program code previously defined criteria of a user or the platform in which they are displayed prior to access such as within a list of results from an internet search engine .

One possible disclosed embodiment may access the system via a website search available profiles and display resulting matching profiles based on a search term selected by a product or service provider. Further embodiments may include returning profiles based on 

Search results may be listed and arranged in order of relevance amount consumer is willing to pay amount and quality of information provided and time request was made geographic relevance and search term relevance with the search listing corresponding to the higher of any one or a combination of these variables. For example page ranking can be performed on a system wide basis or on a product or service provider specified basis. One exemplary page ranking technique for a real estate system can utilize the following weighting such that the results are then sorted by final score highest to lowest .

While the above ranking system utilizes a number of disclosed factors and weights to create a result score those of skill in the relevant art will understand that other weights and factors can be used instead. For example whether a property is to be bought as a first home or an investment property can be used. Additionally points can be assigned added or subtracted on other financial factors as well such as the consumer s income level the price the consumer has indicated they are willing to pay for such products or services any discount that the consumer is requesting on the product service and or the value of the particular item or service the consumer has indicated an interest in.

Similarly geographic information may also cause an increase or decrease in score. For example if a consumer is looking for a property in a particular area of interest e.g. an area close to the product or service provider an area near the area in which the consumer currently resides or an area known to have high sales a score may be increased but a score could be decreased if the area of interest for the consumer is outside of where the product or service provider is licensed to provide services. Geographic areas of interest to the consumer and the geographic areas of interest to the product or service provider can both be used together or individually and can be specified using a number of techniques such as but not limited to zip codes GPS IP address points of interest and additional means.

Additionally meta data maintained by the system about a consumer may also be used in page ranking. For example a first user that has updated his her profile more recently than a second user who otherwise has the same characteristics as the first user may be significantly more valuable to a product or service provider than the second user as the second user may not be an active consumer. Similarly the number of times that a consumer updates his her profile can be used as part of page ranking as well. The system can likewise track and use in page rank the number of times that a consumer has purchased after being contacted the number of times that the consumer has bought similar goods the average price of purchases by the consumer and or the number of purchases per time interval by the consumer.

Additionally meta data maintained by the system about the product or service provider may also be used in page ranking. For example the number of times that the product or service provider selected similar profiles and or the amount of time that the product or service provider previously spent reviewing similar consumer profiles may be used to affect page ranking.

The above discussion has focused on the use of universal static ranking where all service providers receive the same search results if they search on the same criteria. However it is also possible to utilize the above system in the context of an auction or by using bid pricing. For example if a first service provider indicates that it will pay 1 per lead then the first service provider may receive a different and better set of search results than a second service provider that indicates that it is only willing to pay 0.50 per lead. In such a case the second service provider may get delayed leads where the lead is only placed on the second service provider s results after the lead is older than a particular time period e.g. half an hour hour day or week . Alternatively the second service provider may get lower scoring leads than the first service provider that has offered to pay more per lead.

The cost per lead also need not be static. As the pool of leads begins to shrink the cost of each lead may be increased. Similarly as the pool of leads increases the cost per lead may decrease in order to have more service providers matched to consumers. The cost per lead may also be affected by volume discounts such that a service provider that has purchased a threshold number of leads begins to get a discount on future purchases for a particular period of time. Additionally price or position may be influenced by specificity of data.

Profile may be included and be listed in combination with organic search and advertising results on an existing web platform and or search engine.

Additionally the most preferred iteration of the invention may use the consumers ideal price point or price range most recent time of request and geographic area as the most heavily weighted variables in the ranking of results. These variables may be identified and presented as part of the profile prior to the product or service provider selecting and accessing the consumer s profile.

The system of the disclosed embodiments may also act as an intermediary for all or some of the communication of information between the consumers who create profiles and product or service providers who access the profiles. This may include correspondence between the parties or the exchange of funds.

The system of the disclosed embodiments may allow consumers to search for products and speak with knowledgeable professionals about what they are looking for without divulging personal information that may be sold or passed on to other entities without their direct knowledge.

The product or service provider may contact the consumer via a protected email protected phone traditional email text message telephone post mail and or whichever means of communications the consumer or the system has indicated or determined to be of benefit to the product or service provider. In addition the contact with the consumer may be in the form of a posting to a password protected message board or web site e.g. Facebook or LinkedIn . For example a protected email can be a temporary email address at the intermediary system e.g. x13 kdsf35 systemsdomainname.domainextension which the system then forwards to a customer s real email address MeganMatthew customersdomainname.domainextension where domainextension typically is .com .edu etc. Similarly a protected phone number is a phone number of the system that the product or service provider calls and then the system bridges the call to the customer s real phone number. A system may have multiple phone numbers that it associates with certain leads for a period of time or the system may have one or more central numbers that once called use PINs and or system assigned customer numbers that identify which of the leads the product or service provider wishes to contact. Because the system acts as an intermediary the number of contacts to a potential customer can be limited by the system e.g. three contacts can be made before the system stops forwarding email or calls . In one embodiment the system can contact the customer to determine if the customer wishes to authorize an additional number of contacts from the product or service provider such that the product or service provider can continue to send the customer information and or offers.

In addition to a traditional revenue model where the intermediary facilitating the communication between the two parties collects and retains the revenue the intermediary site may also perform a revenue split with the consumer using the service. This process may be based on a direct per transaction method based on typical affiliate programs or on a dividend method where each member is paid some portion of global payout. This payout may also be in the form of credit or points which could be exchanged for goods services or cash. These payouts may also be in the form of gift cards for example.

The system for collecting organizing storing and returning lists of profiles to be accessed or delivering information stored with in a profile to a product or service provider when accessed may be stored on a computer on a network and may be accessed by multiple information sites.

In one possible disclosed embodiment the system may allow for multiple devices and systems all containing their own methods collectively platforms to connect with the system. These platforms would be able to display submit create modify extract and monetize profiles within or somehow associated with the system.

Examples of platforms that may access the system include a website related to a particular subject matter internet search engines software applications and mobile devices. The combination of organic search results from an internet search engine combined with a list of consumer profiles may be offered as an option on a search engine or website if that search engine or website is able to determine if the user is performing a search as a product or service provider or a consumer with an account on the system.

These platforms may access the system via Really Simple Syndication RSS feeds software Application Programming Interfaces APIs custom code connected to the system and designed to present information on a website such as a Widget or some other code designed to allow other platforms to interface with the system.

The system may determine how each profile is relevant to a search request based on search criteria program code with thin the system valuation of the profile number of search terms a geographic area and amount product or service provider is willing to pay for access to all of part of the information contained in the profile information contained within a profile or group of profiles other criteria determined by the system platform accessing the system or any combination.

The system may based on user interaction or use of program code add additional information to a consumer profile based on available information from other data source or providers to further enhance the value of the profile to a product or service provider or further refine a consumers request for a particular product. This may include listing details about previous purchases made or services requested by that consumer or other product or service providers that this consumer frequents.

The system may employ reasonable measures for fraud protection and abuse. The system may maintain consumer s information and act as an intermediary for all communications between consumer and product or service provider. Conversely accounts created by consumers may require some form of verification to ensure that are not charged for false information provided by a consumer or unauthorized or accidentally access of profiles by their account. Additionally the implementation of PPC to access contact the product or service buyers consumers would potentially reduce spam and increase the value of the intermediary service to both the consumer and the professional. The consumer can block or unblock a particular product or service provider so that the consumer is not bothered by product or service providers they do not want to do business with and this would also keep the product or service provider from selecting the same consumer that does not want to be bothered with unwelcome solicitations.

An example of this process may be found in the real estate profession where a consumer s profile has been added to a database which indicates that the consumer is searching for a 500 000 home with 4 bedrooms and 3 baths in Scottsdale Ariz. The consumer request was made at 9 00 am Monday morning.

A loan officer who desires to generate business in that price range performs a search on an internet search engine for consumers who are looking in the 500 000 price range and would be presented with the consumer s profile to be accessed.

A different loan officer who desires to generate business in the city of Scottsdale Ariz. performs a search on a real estate website for consumers who are searching for homes in the city of Scottsdale. That loan officer is presented with the same consumer s profile.

A third loan officer who desires to generate business in the city of Tempe Ariz. and desires consumer s in Tempe Ariz. performs a search in on his mobile devise and is offered the same consumer from Scottsdale profile because the system determined the target city of the search is relatively close to the one listed in the profile or because they are both within Maricopa county or because it was determined that consumers who shop in Scottsdale are likely to desirable consumers for loan officers in Tempe. There are many other cross over data points including time of request geographically and relevance only a few of which were discussed here in this example.

A further example of this process in the real estate profession may be illustrated where a website may exist that may ask members to signup for an account and provide Non Personal Information such as details about the type of house they are looking for e.g. bed bath count type of house location price range and personal information such as contact information e.g. name email address phone number etc. The non personal information such as the details about the type of house they are looking for may then be posted in a list with other members on the website. Real estate agents who have also signed up as professional members of the site may then select one of the members from the list and initiate contact through the site. The member may receive a request from the professional member at which time they would be able to see all the details about the person initiating the request and can then accept reject or report the contact as spam . If a request is accepted the member may then discuss further details about the property with the professional member and if they choose directly communicate any personal contact information.

A further example of this process can be illustrated with an example of a consumer searching for a designer handbag. The consumer is interested in a particular handbag from a particular manufacture and creates a profile with criteria describing the desired bag and excludes the profile from being seen or accessed by any product or service provider that doesn t offer handbags from that specific manufacturer.

A product or service provider who specializes in handbags from that particular manufacturer may contact the first consumer and sell them a handbag. After the sale the consumer may remove their profile as their needs were met. The product or service provider may have the option to keep her information in a database in order to send consumer information to the consumer as new handbags from that same manufacturer become available in an attempt to secure a future sale.

In the same scenario if a second consumer who is interested in all designer handbags if they are offered at a reasonable price may create a profile describing the desire for all designer handbags a reasonable price but she may limit the number of contact to 10 per week for example.

The same product or service provider who contacted the first consumer may also access this profile. Additionally several other product or service providers may select the profile and each may have the option to present their best deal e.g. no shipping costs reduced price and so forth . In this case the consumer may leave her profile active as she is willing to buy at least one designer bag per month so long as she perceives the price to be a bargain for example. Each of these product or service providers is now working to gain the business of the consumer and the consumer is able to get the best deal on each of her purchases without performing hours of product or service searches.

It is also possible that in this scenario product or service provider may per purchase or queue up to access this consumer if the allotted number of contacts for the product or service provider has been reached for a particular time frame.

The consumers may represent a single person an entity a group of persons or a group of entities for example. In this manner a group of persons and or a group of entities may have greater bargaining power when dealing with a particular or groups of particular product or service providers . The product or service provider may be any provider e.g. store manufacturer distributor company corporation entrepreneur agency service etc. of products and or services that may be able to provide products or services to one or more consumers . The product or service provider may be local to the geographic area of the consumer in a different geographic area to the consumer or be a national or international product or service provider for example.

The consumer product or service provider profile database may be coupled to the consumer product or service provider matching server and may store a plurality of profiles for consumers and product or service providers . The database may be accessible and or searchable by the consumer product or service provider matching server the consumers and or the product or service provider for example. The consumer product or service provider matching server may be any device having a processor and a memory that is able to communicate to and from consumers and product or service providers such as a server a computer or a processing device for example.

Processor may include at least one conventional processor or microprocessor that interprets and executes instructions. Memory may be a random access memory RAM or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by flight planning processor . Memory may also store temporary variables or other intermediate information used during execution of instructions by the processor . ROM may include a conventional ROM device or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for the processor .

Input devices may include one or more conventional mechanisms that permit a user to input information to the consumer product or service provider matching server such as a keyboard a mouse a pen a voice recognition device etc. Output devices may include one or more conventional mechanisms that output information to the user including a display a printer one or more speakers or a medium such as a memory or a magnetic or optical disk and a corresponding disk drive. Communication interface may include any transceiver like mechanism that enables the consumer product or service provider matching server to communicate via a network. For example communication interface may include a modem or an Ethernet interface for communicating via a local area network LAN . Alternatively communication interface may include other mechanisms for communicating with other devices and or systems via wired wireless or optical connections. In some implementations of the consumer product or service provider matching server communication interface may not be included in the exemplary consumer product or service provider matching server when the consumer product or service provider matching process is implemented completely within the consumer product or service provider matching environment .

The consumer product or service provider matching server may perform such functions in response to the processor by executing sequences of instructions contained in a computer readable medium such as for example the memory a magnetic disk or an optical disk. Such instructions may be read into the memory from another computer readable medium such as a separate storage device or from a separate device via communication interface .

The consumer product or service provider matching server illustrated in and the related discussion are intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing environment in which the disclosed embodiments may be implemented. Although not required the disclosed embodiments will be described at least in part in the general context of computer executable instructions such as program modules being executed by the consumer product or service provider matching server such as a general purpose computer. Generally program modules include routine programs objects components data structures etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments of the disclosed embodiments may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations including personal computers hand held devices multi processor systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics network PCs minicomputers mainframe computers and the like.

Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by local and remote processing devices that are linked either by hardwired links wireless links or by a combination thereof through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.

The operation of the consumer product or service provider matching unit and consumer product or service provider matching process will be described below in relation to the diagrams shown in .

At step the consumer product or service provider matching unit may receive one or more profiles from one or more consumers . The customer s profile may include contact information including name address telephone numbers and email and website address history of type of products or services needed geographic area lived in or geographic area of interest payment terms account information etc. for example . At step the consumer product or service provider matching unit may receive a consumer s subject matter request. The subject matter request may be a request for products or services an inquiry concerning a geographic area a subject matter search etc. The consumer s profile and the consumer s subject matter request may be received by the consumer product or service provider matching unit through a website for example.

At step the consumer product or service provider matching unit may match the consumer with one or more products or service providers based on at least one of the consumer s profile and subject matter request. At step the consumer product or service provider matching unit may provide the consumer s contact information to the matched one or more products or service providers . The consumer s contact information may contain a telephone number an address an email address a hyperlink to the consumer s email address information inferred by the system or additional consumer profiles for example. The consumer s profile may contain the contact information that is to be provided to the one or more product or service providers for example.

The one or more product or service provider may be charged each time it is provided access to one of the one or more consumer s profiles. In addition a particular product or service provider may be charged each time a consumer accesses contact information contained in advertising information of the one particular product or service provider . The process may then go to step and end.

During the above process the consumers and the one or more product or service providers may be connected to the consumer product or service provider matching unit through the communication interface through the use of at least one of e mail a mobile communications network telephone television electronic communication device and the internet for example.

Note that the consumer product or service provider matching unit may respond to the consumer s subject matter request and the consumer product or service provider matching unit may present the consumer with advertising information for example.

The consumer product or service provider matching unit may update a consumer s profile based on past purchases of products or services subject matter requests etc. for example. The consumer product or service provider matching unit may send at least one of coupons and discounts to the consumer based on at least one of the consumer s profile the consumer s current or past product or services purchases or the consumer s current or past subject matter requests for example.

The consumer product or service provider matching unit may derive a geographic area of interest based on the consumer s subject matter request network address and or the consumer s profile for example. The consumer product or service provider matches unit may then match the consumer with one or more products or service providers based on the consumer s profile the subject matter request and or the derived geographic area.

While the above discussion has been made with respect to an assumed system wide page ranking the system can also be supplemented with a page ranking system that can be specific to a product or service provider. For example a product or service provider may not care about whether a street address is provided and may therefore wish to not reduce a score based on those criteria. However a product or service provider may want to more strongly rank potential buyers in a particular geographic area e.g. zip code 20001 causes a 10 pt. increase in score or state HI causes a 10 pt. decrease in score .

Furthermore the system may be configured to override certain scoring factors. For example a company that specializes in credit repair may wish to provide a higher score to Poor credit than Excellent credit. Thus a product or service provider may be able to better customize search results as part of their particular product or service provider profile.

An interface such as is shown in may additionally be supplemented such that the most active product or service providers receive advertising space on the websites on which they are purchasing access to consumer profiles. The advertising space may be in the form of banners or advertisements generally that are or include hyperlinks to information regarding the product or service provider or may be specific to geographic regions in which the product or service provider is purchasing access to consumer profiles.

As discussed with respect to delayed leads above some product or service providers may be willing to pay for more timely access to profiles. Profiles can therefore be offered on a right of first refusal basis. For example a first service provider that bids the highest amount may be the first service provider to receive notice of all new or updated consumer profiles that match a specified criteria. The first service provider may then have a set period of time in which to either claim the consumer profile pass on the consumer profile thereby not exercising the right of first refusal or hold the consumer profile either at no cost or at a smaller cost than claiming the profile .

After the first product or service provider has passed on a consumer profile or after a hold has been released or expired the right to access the consumer profile information would then pass to a second product or service provider or to a second tier of product or service providers . The process could then repeat for as many levels as exist within the system. The hierarchy can be based on bids historical buying patterns profiles and or geographic information for example. The offering of the consumer profiles can be by email posting to a website text message etc. such that product or service providers are notified of when new consumer profiles are available and by when they must respond
