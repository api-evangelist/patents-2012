Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to radio frequency signal receivers and more particularly to a method and apparatus for providing radio frequency RF photonic filtering within an RF receiver.

Current radio frequency RF receivers operate over large bandwidths and utilize frequency agile techniques to suppress noise and provide high spur free dynamic range SFDR to improve signal reception. Such low noise high SFDR receivers find use in communication systems as well as radar systems. To operate over large bandwidths and provide high SFDR these systems utilize multiple receivers and one or more associated antennas in a conjoined synchronous manner. Each individual receiver with the system is designed to accurately operate over a small bandwidth. Through parallel operation of a plurality of receivers the system achieves a large reception bandwidth. However using multiple receivers requires sophisticated command and control techniques to ensure the receivers operate in a synchronous manner.

Furthermore in high frequency receiver applications it is important that every component within the receiver have very low loss to facilitate the accurate reception of signals with very low signal strength. In some situations a front end of the receiver high frequency components may be co located with an antenna that is remote from a back end of the receiver low frequency components . Expensive low loss RF cables are required to interconnect the front end and backend of each receiver.

Therefore there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus for wideband low loss signal processing of RF signals within RF receivers.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and apparatus for providing RF photonic filtering. Specifically one embodiment of the invention is an apparatus comprising a radio frequency RF photonic filter for filtering an RF signal where the RF photonic filter comprises a loop comprising an electro optical modulator an optical fiber a photo detector.

Another embodiment of the invention is a method of operating an RF photonic filter comprising applying a reference signal to the RF photonic filter selecting a reference frequency for the RF photonic filter upon the RF photonic filter locking to the reference frequency disconnecting the reference signal and applying an RF input signal to the RF photonic filter to lock the RF input signal to the RF photonic filter.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise a method and apparatus for receiving an RF signal from an antenna and using a RF photonic filter to provide broadband tuning and extended spur free dynamic range SFDR . The RF photonic filter operating as a single mode resonator amplifies the desired RF signal and substantially suppresses other RF input signals causing signal spurs to be substantially reduced. Additionally in one embodiment the RF photonic filter provides an optical output for coupling RF signals to a remotely located signal processor using a low loss low cost optical fiber.

In one embodiment of the receiver the receiver comprises an RF photonic filter a mixer and a local oscillator . The mixer and the local oscillator operate together as a frequency converter . The RF photonic filter operates as a single mode resonator that amplifies the desired RF signal and suppresses undesired RF input signals. The desired RF signal is coupled to the mixer . Through mixing a local oscillator signal from the local oscillator with the RF signal an intermediate frequency IF signal is generated. The IF signal is coupled to the signal processor to facilitate extraction of Information from the received signal.

In other embodiments of the receiver an optical output signal from the RF photonic filter may be coupled through fiber optic cable to a remotely located frequency converter and signal processor not shown . In other embodiments the receiver may not be co located with a transmitter to form a transceiver. In such embodiments the receiver operates autonomously. Any RF receiver utilizing a RF photonic filter as described herein is considered within the scope of the present invention.

In operation the RF photonic filter operates in two modes a first mode is a reference lock mode for coarsely tuning the filter and a second mode is a single lock mode for finely tuning the filter . In the reference lock mode the controller couples the RF reference source to the reference clock module via the RF switch . The controller applies a frequency control signal to the reference lock module to select an operating frequency for the filter . This operating frequency is approximately equal to the expected frequency of the RF input signal to the receiver. As such the reference lock module and the single RF mode optical loop form an oscillator having a resonant frequency at the frequency set by the frequency control signal. Thus the filter is coarsely tuned to the expected frequency of the RF input. Once the filter is locked to the reference signal and oscillating at the selected frequency the filter switches to the signal lock mode wherein the controller opens the second RF switch and closes the first RF switch . In this manner the RF input signal is coupled to the signal lock module and the RF reference signal is disconnected from the reference lock module .

In the signal lock mode the signal lock module uses the RF input signal to finely tune the filter to center upon the frequency of the RF input signal. The combination of the signal lock module and the single RF mode optical loop form a high Q bandpass filter centered at the center frequency of the RF input signal. The filter can be rapidly retuned to another signal by switching to the reference lock mode and using the controller to change the operating frequency of the reference lock module.

For example in a radar application the radar transmission signal may be used as the reference signal to coarsely lock a RF photonic filter to the frequency of transmission. The reflected signal from an object will have a frequency that is slightly higher or lower than the frequency of transmission. During signal lock mode the reflected RF signal is rapidly locked and processed by the signal processor. The high Q of the RF photonic filter facilitates high spur free dynamic range.

The RF signal is coupled to the RF filter . In one embodiment the RF filter is a narrow band band pass filter e.g. percentage 10 of a single expected received signal center frequency. In other embodiments the RF filter has a bandwidth wide enough to pass the expected received RF signal plus any expected carrier frequency tuning. The RF coupler provides a sample of the RF signal exiting the RF filter . This sample of RF signal is coupled to the PLL to complete a feedback loop for the PLL . In this manner the reference lock module in comprises the PLL RF phase shifter RF filter and RF coupler .

The RF signal is coupled from the RF coupler to the electro optical modulator . The electro optical modulator modulates the light from the laser with the RF signal. The resulting optical signal is coupled to the optical filter optional for wavelength filtering.

The optical signal from the filter is coupled to the fiber splitter . According to exemplary embodiments the fiber splitter splits the filtered optical signal into two signals one signal is transmitted through the optical fiber link which may be 10 m to 100 m or longer and has a low Q to a photo detector . The other signal is coupled to an optical fiber to carry the signal to a remote location to provide remote signal output. At the remote location a photo detector converts the optical signal into an RF signal that can be processed at point .

The photo detector converts the optical signal to an RF signal and sends the RF signal to the RF coupler . The photo detector may optionally send the RF signal to an RF amplifier which further amplifies the signal and couples it to the RF coupler . In one embodiment the photonic link provides enough gain where the amplifier is not needed. The RF coupler taps the RF signal to provide the first RF output signal . The RF signal is coupled to the phase shifter . Phase shifter is electronically tunable and its output forms one input to the RF combiner .

The second input of the RF combiner is the received RF signal from the antenna in into switch . The RF combiner combines both RF signals from the first and second inputs. The output of the combiner is coupled to an RF coupler for coupling a sample of the output of the combiner to the injection lock servo . The signal lock module of comprises the phase shifter RF combiner RF coupler and Insertion lock servo . This combination of components is used to fine tune the filter such that the filter locks to the center frequency of the RF input signal during the signal lock mode.

The bias control unit applies DC bias to the electro optical modulator and to the injection lock servo . DC bias is applied to end used by the electro optical modulator in a well known manner to facilitate modulating light with an RF signal. DC bias is applied to the insertion lock servo to offset an accumulated DC bias in the feedback loop within the signal lock module. The output of RF coupler is coupled to a second RF phase shifter . The phase shifter is a tunable shifter which is controlled by the electronic servo .

The single RF mode optical loop comprises portions of both the reference lock module and the signal lock module . Specifically the loop comprises the RF combiner the phase shifter RF filter electro optical modulator the optical filter the fiber splitter the optical fiber the photo detector the RF amplifier and the phase shifter . According to an exemplary embodiment the length of optical fiber is predetermined such that only one RF mode can oscillate within the filter . All other natural frequency modes of the filter are suppressed causing the loop to form a single mode cavity or resonator for the RF oscillation. The filter can filter out other strong signals in a close frequency range and amplify the signal of interest providing a spur free dynamic range for the receiver. In one example optical fiber is 100 m in length providing a bandwidth of 10 Mhz for a 10 GHz RF carrier.

The method forms the reference lock mode using steps through . Step represents the signal lock mode. If a receiver using the filter of the present invention is required to process a signal at a different frequency the method can be executed again using a different reference frequency in step that facilitates receiving a different input signal. In this manner the RF photonic filter of the present invention can be used as a flexible front end to an RF receiver.
