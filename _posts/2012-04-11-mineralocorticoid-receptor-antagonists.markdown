This application is the National Stage of International Application No. PCT CN2012 073795 filed on Oct. 18 2012 which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 474 816 filed Apr. 13 2011.

The Mineralocorticoid Receptor MR is a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by aldosterone and regulates the expression of many genes involved in electrolyte homeostasis and cardiovascular disease. Increased circulating aldosterone increases blood pressure through its effects on natriuresis with potentially additional effects on the brain heart and vasculature. In addition hyperaldosteronism have been linked to many pathophysiological processes resulting in renal and cardiovascular disease. While hyperaldosteronism is commonly caused by aldosterone producing adenomas resistant hypertensive patients frequently suffer from increased aldosterone levels often termed as Aldosterone Breakthrough as a result of increases in serum potassium or residual AT1R activity. Hyperaldosteronism and aldosterone breakthrough typically results in increased MR activity and MR antagonists have been shown to be effective as anti hypertensive agents and also in the treatment of heart failure and primary hyperaldosteronism.

In addition in visceral tissues such as the kidney and the gut MR regulates sodium retention potassium excretion and water balance in response to aldosterone. MR expression in the brain also appears to play a role in the control of neuronal excitability in the negative feedback regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and in the cognitive aspects of behavioral performance Castren et al. J. of Neuroendocrinology 3 461 66 1993 .

The term substituted shall be deemed to include multiple degrees of substitution by a named substituent. Where multiple substituent moieties are disclosed or claimed the substituted compound can be independently substituted by one or more of the disclosed or claimed substituent moieties singly or plurally. By independently substituted it is meant that the two or more substituents can be the same or different.

Where a substituent or variable has multiple definitions it is understood that the substituent or variable is defined as being selected from the group consisting of the indicated definitions.

Compounds of structural Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures single enantiomers diastereoisomeric mixtures and individual diastereoisomers. The present invention is meant to comprise all such isomeric forms of the compounds of structural Formula I.

Compounds of structural Formula I may be separated into their individual diastereoisomers by for example fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof or via chiral chromatography using an optically active stationary phase. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized if necessary with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.

Alternatively any stereoisomer or isomers of a compound of the general structural Formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known absolute configuration.

If desired racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereoisomeric mixture followed by separation of the individual diastereoisomers by standard methods such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases which methods are well known in the art.

For compounds described herein which contain olefinic double bonds unless specified otherwise they are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.

Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example a ketone and its enol form are keto enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention.

In the compounds of structural Formula I the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominately found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of structural Formula I. For example different isotopic forms of hydrogen H include protium H and deuterium H also denoted as D . Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages such as increasing in vivo half life or reducing dosage requirements or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically enriched compounds within structural Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically enriched reagents and or intermediates. Thus the present invention covers isotopically enriched compounds including deuterated compounds.

The present invention includes all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have S configuration or R configuration. The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers for example mixtures of enantiomers and or diastereomers in all ratios. Thus enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out if desired by separation of a mixture by customary methods for example by chromatography or crystallization by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at the stage of the compounds of the Formula I or at the stage of an intermediate during the synthesis. The present invention also includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I.

The present invention includes all atropisomer forms of the compounds of Formula I. Atropisomers are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers. Atropisomers display axial chirality. Separation of atropisomers is possibly by chiral resolution methods such as selective crystallization.

It will be understood that as used herein references to the compounds of structural Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.

The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts of basic compounds encompassed within the term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refer to non toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Representative salts of basic compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to the following acetate ascorbate benzenesulfonate benzoate bicarbonate bisulfate bitartrate borate bromide butyrate camphorate camphorsulfonate camsylate carbonate chloride clavulanate citrate dihydrochloride edetate edisylate estolate esylate fumarate gluceptate gluconate glutamate glycollylarsanilate hexylresorcinate hydrabamine hydrobromide hydrochloride hydroxynaphthoate iodide isothionate lactate lactobionate laurate malate maleate mandelate mesylate methylbromide methylnitrate methylsulfate methanesulfonate mucate napsylate nitrate N methylglucamine ammonium salt oleate oxalate pamoate embonate palmitate pantothenate phosphate diphosphate polygalacturonate propionate salicylate stearate sulfate subacetate succinate tannate tartrate teoclate thiocyanate tosylate triethiodide valerate and the like. Furthermore where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include but are not limited to salts derived from inorganic bases including aluminum ammonium calcium copper ferric ferrous lithium magnesium manganic mangamous potassium sodium zinc and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium calcium magnesium potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines cyclic amines dicyclohexyl amines and basic ion exchange resins such as arginine betaine caffeine choline N N dibenzylethylenediamine diethylamine 2 diethylaminoethanol 2 dimethylaminoethanol ethanolamine ethylenediamine N ethylmorpholine N ethylpiperidine glucamine glucosamine histidine hydrabamine isopropylamine lysine methylglucamine morpholine piperazine piperidine polyamine resins procaine purines theobromine triethylamine trimethylamine tripropylamine tromethamine and the like.

Also in the case of a carboxylic acid COOH or alcohol group being present in the compounds of the present invention pharmaceutically acceptable esters of carboxylic acid derivatives such as methyl ethyl or pivaloyloxymethyl or acyl derivatives of alcohols such as O acetyl O pivaloyl O benzoyl and O aminoacyl can be employed. Included are those esters and acyl groups known in the art for modifying the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained release or prodrug formulations.

Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which owing to low physiological compatibility are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used for example as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically acceptable salts. The terms physiologically acceptable salt s and pharmaceutically acceptable salt s are intended to have the same meaning and are used interchangeably herein.

The compounds of the Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be administered to animals preferably to mammals and in particular to humans as pharmaceuticals by themselves in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The term patient includes animals preferably mammals and especially humans who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of said disease or medical condition.

A subject of the present invention therefore also are the compounds of the Formula I and their pharmaceutically physiologically acceptable salts for use as pharmaceuticals their use for antagonizing mineralocorticoid receptors and in particular their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the abovementioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes.

A therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue a system animal or human that is being sought by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue a system animal or human by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount e.g. for treatment of hypertension and a prophylactically effective amount e.g. for prevention of myocardial infarction.

Furthermore a subject of the present invention are pharmaceutical preparations or pharmaceutical compositions which comprise as active component an effective dose of at least one compound of the Formula I and or a physiologically pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier i.e. one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances and or additives.

Thus subjects of the invention are for example said compound and its pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable salts for use as a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical preparations which comprise as an active component a therapeutically effective dose of said compound and or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof and a customary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and the uses of said compound and or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof in the therapy or prophylaxis of the abovementioned syndromes as well as their use for preparing medicaments for these purposes.

The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be administered orally for example in the form of pills tablets lacquered tablets sugar coated tablets granules hard and soft gelatin capsules aqueous alcoholic or oily solutions syrups emulsions or suspensions or rectally for example in the form of suppositories. Administration can also be carried out parenterally for example subcutaneously intramuscularly or intravenously in the form of solutions for injection or infusion. Other suitable administration forms are for example percutaneous or topical administration for example in the form of ointments tinctures sprays or transdermal therapeutic systems or the inhalative administration in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures or for example microcapsules implants or rods. The preferred administration form depends for example on the disease to be treated and on its severity.

The amount of active compound of the Formula I and or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from 0.2 to 700 mg preferably from 1 to 500 mg per dose but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical preparation it can also be higher. The pharmaceutical preparations usually comprise 0.5 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of the Formula I and or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of the pharmaceutical preparations can be carried out in a manner known per se. For this purpose one or more compounds of the Formula I and or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical carrier substances and or additives or auxiliary substances and if desired in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds having therapeutic or prophylactic action are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human or veterinary medicine.

For the production of pills tablets sugar coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use for example lactose starch for example maize starch or starch derivatives talc stearic acid or its salts etc. Carriers for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are for example fats waxes semisolid and liquid polyols natural or hardened oils etc. Suitable carriers for the preparation of solutions for example of solutions for injection or of emulsions or syrups are for example water physiologically sodium chloride solution alcohols such as ethanol glycerol polyols sucrose invert sugar glucose mannitol vegetable oils etc. It is also possible to lyophilize the compounds of the Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and to use the resulting lyophilisates for example for preparing preparations for injection or infusion. Suitable carriers for microcapsules implants or rods are for example copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid.

Besides the active compounds and carriers the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain customary additives for example fillers disintegrants binders lubricants wetting agents stabilizers emulsifiers dispersants preservatives sweeteners colorants flavorings aromatizers thickeners diluents buffer substances solvents solubilizers agents for achieving a depot effect salts for altering the osmotic pressure coating agents or antioxidants.

The dosage of the active compound of the Formula I to be administered and or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof depends on the individual case and is as is customary to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated and also on the sex age weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of the Formula I. In general a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg kg preferably 0.01 to 10 mg kg in particular 0.3 to 5 mg kg in each case mg per kg of bodyweight is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose can be administered in a single dose or in particular when larger amounts are administered be divided into several for example two three or four individual doses. In some cases depending on the individual response it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose.

The compounds of the Formula I bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor and antagonize the biological effects of aldosterone and cortisol. On account of this property apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on the mineralocorticoid receptor is intended and also for diagnostic purposes for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of the Formula I and salts thereof can furthermore be employed as already mentioned above as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.

The above mentioned compounds are also of use in combination with other pharmacologically active compounds. Additional active compounds that may be used in combination with the compounds of the instant invention either co administered or in a fixed combination include but are not limited to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors e.g. alacepril benazepril captopril ceronapril cilazapril delapril enalapril enalaprilat fosinopril imidapril lisinopril moveltipril perindopril quinapril ramipril spirapril temocapril or trandolapril angiotensin II receptor antagonists e.g. losartan valsartan candesartan olmesartan telmesartan neutral endopeptidase inhibitors e.g. thiorphan and phosphoramidon aldosterone antagonists renin inhibitors e.g. urea derivatives of di and tri peptides See U.S. Pat.
