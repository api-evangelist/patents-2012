Computers have become highly integrated in the workforce in the home in mobile devices and many other places. Computers can process massive amounts of information quickly and efficiently. Software applications designed to run on computer systems allow users to perform a wide variety of functions including business applications schoolwork entertainment and more. Software applications are often designed to perform specific tasks such as word processor applications for drafting documents or email programs for sending receiving and organizing email.

In some cases software applications are designed to manage and perform operations on large portions of data. For example spreadsheet applications may allow users to perform mathematical organizational or other types of operations on large data sets. Within the spreadsheet applications users may also be able to create or select visual presentations for the data. Examples of such presentations include tables charts graphs and reports. Thus a user may be able to select a chart table graph or report for a given portion of data. However many times the quantity and nature of the data may not lend itself to clear categorization. In such cases a user may have a large portion of raw data and may not know which type of presentation to use.

Embodiments described herein are directed to selecting and applying data specific presentations to adaptively selecting visual presentations based on historical data and to providing rendering hints for data presentations. In one embodiment a computer system receives an indication that a visual presentation is to be applied to a specified portion of data. The computer system analyzes the specified data to determine which of a plurality of data presentations is most relevant for the specified data. The relevance is based on relevancy factors including one or more of the following end user profile structure of the specified data and patterns within the specified data. The computer system then applies the determined appropriate visual presentation to the specified data.

In another embodiment a computer system adaptively selects visual presentations based on historical data. The computer system analyzes prior visual presentation selections for specified sets of data and determines based on which visual presentations were selected for the specified data sets which visual presentations are most relevant for a currently selected data set. The relevance is based on relevancy factors including one or more of the following end user profile structure of the specified data and patterns within the specified data. The computer system then applies the determined appropriate visual presentation to the currently selected data set.

In still another embodiment a computer system provides rendering hints for data presentations. The computer system selects a portion of data for uploading to a data store and also selects rendering hints to be applied to the selected portion of data. The rendering hints indicate how the selected data is to be rendered in a visual presentation. The computer system then appends the selected rendering hints to the selected portion of data and uploads the selected portion of data and the appended rendering hints to the data store.

The following discussion now refers to a number of methods and method acts that may be performed. It should be noted that although the method acts may be discussed in a certain order or illustrated in a flow chart as occurring in a particular order no particular ordering is necessarily required unless specifically stated or required because an act is dependent on another act being completed prior to the act being performed.

Embodiments of the present invention may comprise or utilize a special purpose or general purpose computer including computer hardware such as for example one or more processors and system memory as discussed in greater detail below. Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include physical and other computer readable media for carrying or storing computer executable instructions and or data structures. Such computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer system. Computer readable media that store computer executable instructions in the form of data are computer storage media. Computer readable media that carry computer executable instructions are transmission media. Thus by way of example and not limitation embodiments of the invention can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer readable media computer storage media and transmission media.

Computer storage media includes RAM ROM EEPROM CD ROM solid state drives SSDs that are based on RAM Flash memory phase change memory PCM or other types of memory or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer executable instructions data or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.

A network is defined as one or more data links and or data switches that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and or modules and or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network either hardwired wireless or a combination of hardwired or wireless to a computer the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmission media can include a network which can be used to carry data or desired program code means in the form of computer executable instructions or in the form of data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.

Further upon reaching various computer system components program code means in the form of computer executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission media to computer storage media or vice versa . For example computer executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module e.g. a network interface card or NIC and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and or to less volatile computer storage media at a computer system. Thus it should be understood that computer storage media can be included in computer system components that also or even primarily utilize transmission media.

Computer executable or computer interpretable instructions comprise for example instructions which cause a general purpose computer special purpose computer or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. The computer executable instructions may be for example binaries intermediate format instructions such as assembly language or even source code. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and or methodological acts it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the described features or acts described above. Rather the described features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations including personal computers desktop computers laptop computers message processors hand held devices multi processor systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics network PCs minicomputers mainframe computers mobile telephones PDAs tablets pagers routers switches and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed system environments where local and remote computer systems that are linked either by hardwired data links wireless data links or by a combination of hardwired and wireless data links through a network each perform tasks e.g. cloud computing cloud services and the like . In a distributed system environment program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.

The computer system includes various modules for performing a variety of different functions. For instance data analyzing module may be configured to receive indication from user . The data analyzing module may access the identification to determine which data has been specified by the user. Then based on which data has been identified the analyzing module may analyze the data to determine which of a variety of presentations is to be used to present the data.

As used herein the term presentation or visual presentation refers to any visual representation of data. Presentations may include visualizations such as graphs charts and tables. Presentations may also include interactive items such as reports. Different presentations may be more suited to different types of data. For instance the analyzing module may determine that the data includes names and addresses of different persons. The analyzing module may determine that a table is the best way to present that data. In such cases the presentation applying module would apply a table in the size shape and orientation that was the most suitable for the specified data.

In some cases the data analyzing and presentation applying modules along with any others used to provide these services may be provided as an extension to other software programs or services. The extension allows users to select e.g. via a right click on the mouse a Create chart or Create table icon in a word processing spreadsheet or other application. The extension allows a user to specify which data or data feed is to be used when creating the char or table or other presentation . In some cases where access to the data is limited the extension asks the user to provide a username and password indicating the user s subscription to the data.

The extension then generates an appropriate presentation by receiving data from the specified data or data feed . The extension may also be provided with a definition of a report chart or other presentation that was recommended for the data. The definition may include a presentation that was provided by the provider or producer of the data e.g. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics by a community associated with that data e.g. a national think tank or other organization associated with the Bureau of Labor Statistics or by the provider of the extension or the office suite application. The definition may be included in metadata that is appended to the data or data feed. This metadata includes the definition of the presentation name series definitions axis marks etc. along with a set of aggregated queries to the data store that can be interpreted by the service to produce data that can span numerous rows. As will be understood the data store may be any type of physical or virtual local or remote distributed storage area network SAN cloud based data storage or any combination thereof. The data store may in some cases be a data marketplace where data is bought and sold from data producers.

The metadata may include table chart graph or other metadata including the chart s name type color names units location scale or other characteristics. The metadata may include metadata used to build presentations in the office suite application. Data metadata may include column or parameter name column parameter type unit classifier etc. Marketplace metadata may include account identifier ID subscription ID offer ID set of queries indication to aggregate or sequence etc. Visualization metadata may include the colors and or the presets used to present the final form of the document spreadsheet etc. and the actual payload i.e. the data results coming back from the data store . These concepts will be explained further below with regard to methods and of respectively.

In view of the systems and architectures described above methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flow charts of and . For purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks. However it should be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks as some blocks may occur in different orders and or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter.

Method includes an act of receiving an indication that a visual presentation is to be applied to a specified portion of data act . For example data analyzing module of computer system may receive indication from user . The indication indicates that a visual presentation is to be applied to the data specified by the user data . The user may enter this indication through a standalone application service or user interface UI or through an extension to an application service or UI. The extension may apply to and function with multiple different applications. For instance as mentioned above the extension may apply to an office suite with a word processing application a spreadsheet application a presentation application and others. The visual presentation may include static data as displayed in graphs charts or tables or may be interactive as with a report . Interactive presentations allow users to apply user input to change or modify the presentation dynamically as the user provides the inputs.

Method further includes an act of analyzing the specified data to determine which of a plurality of data presentations is most relevant for the specified data the relevance being based on relevancy factors including one or more of the following end user profile structure of the specified data and patterns within the specified data act . For example data analyzing module may analyze the specified data to determine which data presentation is most relevant. Different types of data may lend themselves to more to certain types of presentations. Some data may be better presented as a report while other data is better represented as a graph. Still further some data may be best presented as a combination of charts graphs and tables. The data analyzing module may determine which presentation is most relevant for each separate part of the specified data. The relevancy is determined based on one or more relevancy factors.

Relevancy factors as used herein refer to various indicators or other characteristics of the data that indicate why a certain presentation is suitable for that type of data. Relevancy factors may include end user profile the structure of the specified data and or patterns within the data . The end user is the person that is viewing the visual presentations of the data. The end user also specifies which data or data feeds are to be included in the visual presentation. The user s profile may indicate certain preferences for visual presentations. For instance the user s profile may indicate a preference for tables for certain types of data and a preference for reports for other types of data. The data analyzing module may also look at historical data indicating the user s past choices for visual presentations. Thus based on past decisions the data analyzing module may make intelligent decisions about the relevancy of a particular presentation.

The structure of the data may also be used to determine the relevancy of a particular presentation to a specified portion of data. If the data is structured as a list of items in columns and rows for example a table may be the most appropriate i.e. the most relevant presentation for that data. If the data is structured as graphics and associated text a chart or graph may be the most relevant presentation. Thus data structure may be used to determine relevancy. Furthermore patterns in the data such as one column including names another including addresses and another including phone numbers may be used to determine which presentation is most relevant. Patterns data structure and user profile may all be consulted to determine which presentation is most relevant for any given set of data.

Determining relevancy may also include identifying other data perhaps from within data store or from outside it e.g. from the internet which is related to the data currently presented. For instance if the user had selected sports statistics data for a specific player a relevancy determination may determine that team information league information and ticket sales information are also relevant. These additional portions of information may be presented to the user . The user may then decide whether to generate presentations for those additional portions of data that were determined to be relevant. Determining relevancy may further include determining which presentations other users other user profiles or other industries have identified as data that is relevant to the specified data. This data may similarly be presented to the user for generation of a visualization.

In some embodiments various questions may be presented to user to determine the relevance of a specified portion of data. The questions may assist the system in determining whether certain types or sources of data are relevant to that user. The user then answers the questions indicating which types and or sources of data are relevant to the user. Then in response to the received answers the data analyzing module determines the relevance of the specified data. The user s answers along with other relevancy factors may be used to determine which data to present to the user and which presentations to use to present the data to the user.

In some cases data may be uploaded from computer system to data store e.g. data . The uploaded data may be tagged with tags that identify one or more characteristics of the data. For instance the tags may indicate that the data is owned by the end user and that the data is related to a specific project the user is involved in at work. The data analyzing module may determine logical joints between the different portions of tagged uploaded data. Thus in situations where the data store is storing data from multiple different users or has access to data from multiple users stored on other storage systems the data analyzing module may analyze the data tags to determine similarities between the different users data. In some cases this may be referred to as business domain joining where logical connections are discovered between different user s or different businesses data. Still further if the user is aware of logical connections the user may provide an indication of logical joints between the portions of tagged uploaded data. This information may then be presented to the end user as being potentially relevant. The tagged data may also be categorized according to various user defined or other predefined data categories. The categorization may further assist in determining relevance as some categories of data may be more suited to certain presentations.

Method also includes an act of applying the determined appropriate visual presentation to the specified data act . Thus once the appropriate relevant visual presentation has been determined based on one or more of the relevancy factors the presentation applying module applies the selected presentation to the specified data e.g. data or data feed . The generated presentation may then be displayed on display . In addition to the generated presentation any portions of additional data determined to be relevant to the determined appropriate presentation may be automatically applied to the generated presentation or may be displayed in a separate presentation.

Method includes an act of analyzing one or more prior visual presentation selections for specified sets of data act . For example data analyzing module may access and analyze past presentations selections from the historical data . The selections may have been from the end user other end users other user s within the end user s company or another company or other industry users. The selections indicate which presentations were selected for which data sets.

Method also includes an act of determining based on which visual presentations were selected for the specified data sets which one or more visual presentations are most relevant for a currently selected data set the relevance being based on relevancy factors including one or more of the following end user profile structure of the specified data and patterns within the specified data act . Accordingly data analyzing module may analyze the historical data to determine which presentation is most relevant. Past selections may be used by themselves in determining the relevancy of a particular presentation or may be used in conjunction with the other relevancy factors user profile data structure and or data patterns as explained above.

In some cases different weights may be applied for specified users specified profiles or specified industries. Accordingly when determining relevancy more or less weight may be applied to certain users certain data structures or certain past selections. For example in one embodiment a greater amount of weight may be given to past selections when determining relevancy. This may be based on a desire to have uniformity throughout a company s presentations. In another embodiment a greater amount of weight may be given to data structure and or data patterns. In such cases it may be more desirable to have a presentation that matches the data structure regardless of past decisions. These are merely two examples among many and should not be read as limiting. Moreover it will be understood that any combination of weighting may be applied giving some relevancy factors more or less weighting based on the current context e.g. which end user is currently using the program which data set is being used etc. .

Method further includes an act of applying the determined appropriate visual presentation to the currently selected data set act . Once the most relevant presentation has been determined for the specified data the presentation applying module applies the selected presentation to the data. In this manner a presentation is dynamically generated specifically for the chosen data set. In some embodiments as shown in an application may present a selection of data feeds to a user e.g. data feeds A A and A . The user may then select one or more of the feeds in data feed is selected . Upon receiving the user s selection of data feeds the presentation applying module may automatically generate a visual presentation that is appropriate for the selected data feed. In a table is generated for data feed A . As will be understood any type of presentation may be chosen for a set of data or a data feed. Accordingly table is merely one example of a presentation among many possible presentation types.

Still further as shown in a software application may present potential visual presentations for selection by the user. Accordingly in some cases a user may be using the software application and presentation may be displayed on the user s display. The currently displayed presentation may be a report with a chart and various other data. The system may determine that other data of which the system is aware may be relevant to the currently displayed report. Accordingly the system may automatically generate a visual presentation for the data determined to be relevant to that data displayed in the original visual presentation. As such suggested presentation with its accompanying pie chart may be displayed next to or near the original presentation . It will be understood that many different types of presentation may be presented to the user and that the user can specify whether to display the relevant data or not and how the relevant data is to be displayed i.e. the user can select which presentation is used to show the relevant additional data . In this manner the user can be shown the data they originally selected along with additional relevant data. The relevancy may be determined according to any of the relevancy determining methods described above.

Turning now to illustrates a flowchart of a method for providing rendering hints for data presentations. The method will now be described with frequent reference to the components and data of environment .

Method includes an act of selecting a portion of data for uploading to a data store act . For example user may select various data and or data feeds from the data store . The specified data may be sent to the computer system via indication . The indication may also include the user s selection of one or more rendering hints to be applied to the selected portion of data act . The rendering hints indicating how the selected data is to be rendered in a visual presentation. In some cases the rendering hints are appended to the uploaded data as metadata e.g. A . In this manner when a data owner or other user uploads data to the data store the owner can specify which presentations are to be used with that data or at least which presentations are recommended for that data . In some cases the rendering hints may be specific to a particular computing device or software application. Thus if that computing device is used or that software application is used certain presentations will be recommended by the hints as being most applicable or as being preferred for that computer system or application.

Method includes an act of appending the selected rendering hints to the selected portion of data act . Thus as mentioned above the rendering hints A may be applied to the uploaded data . User interfaces UIs and or application programming interfaces APIs may be used to apply rendering hints to a selected portion of data. The UIs and APIs provide a convenient way for users or programmers to apply rendering hints to data. The data is then uploaded with its appended rendering hints to the data store act and may be rendered according to the appended rendering hints. In this manner a data owner may have at least some degree of control over how the owner s data is presented in a visual presentation.

Accordingly methods systems and computer program products are provided which select and apply data specific presentations. Moreover methods systems and computer program products are provided which adaptively select visual presentations based on historical data and provide rendering hints for data presentations.

The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is therefore indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
