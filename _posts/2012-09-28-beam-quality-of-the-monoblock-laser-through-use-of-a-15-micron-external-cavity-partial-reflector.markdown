title: Beam quality of the monoblock laser through use of a 1.5 micron external cavity partial reflector
abstract: A monoblock laser cavity incorporates optical components for a short-pulse laser. These optical components are ‘locked’ into alignment forming an optical laser cavity for flash lamp or diode laser pumping. The optical laser cavity does not need optical alignment after it is fabricated, increasing the brightness of the monoblock laser.

This is a divisional patent application of copending application Ser. No. 12 848 272 filed Aug. 2 2010 entitled Beam Quality of the Monoblock Laser Through Use of a 1.5 Micron External Cavity Partial Reflector. The aforementioned application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used sold imported and or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.

The disclosure relates to a monoblock laser cavity having optical components for a short pulse laser.

Laser range finders are an increasingly vital component in high precision targeting engagements. The precise and accurate range to target information is an essential variable for fire control of weapons. This information is easily and timely provided by laser range finders.

Unfortunately known laser range finders are bulky heavy and expensive. These laser range finders were not developed with the individual field use in mind.

Monoblock laser makes the development fabrication of a very low cost compact laser range finder feasible. Unfortunately the beam divergence of known monoblock lasers is rather large typically between 8 and 14 mRad . Such a laser has a fairly low brightness wherein a sizable optic is needed to collimate the monoblock laser output.

A monoblock laser cavity having optical components is disclosed for a short pulse laser. One exemplary embodiment of a monoblock laser cavity includes a gain medium having one coated end surface a juncture in the medium and another end surface a passive Q switch having one end surface optically facing said another end surface of the gain medium and an optical parametric oscillator crystal having one end surface and an output face. The one end surface of the optical parametric oscillator crystal optically is configured to face another end surface of the Q switch. An output coupler is placed on the output face of the optical parametric oscillator crystal. Such a monoblock laser can improve the brightness and decrease the beam divergence of the monoblock laser.

In one aspect an exemplary embodiment of a monoblock laser cavity arrangement can be based on an external cavity partial reflector. Such an exemplary arrangement comprises an Nd YAG gain medium having one coated end surface a juncture in the medium having a Brewster s angle for polarization and another end surface a passive Q switch having one end surface optically facing said another end surface of the gain medium an optical parametric oscillator crystal having one end surface and an output face said one end surface of the optical parametric oscillator crystal optically facing another end surface of the Q switch wherein an output coupler is placed on said output face of the optical parametric oscillator crystal and an external cavity partial reflector having one end surface disposed to optically face said output coupler.

Yet another exemplary embodiment of a monoblock laser cavity arrangement can be based on a curved surface external cavity partial reflector. Such an exemplary arrangement comprises an Nd YAG gain medium having one coated end surface a juncture in the medium having a Brewster s angle for polarization and another end surface a passive Q switch having one end surface optically facing said another end surface of the gain medium an optical parametric oscillator crystal having one end surface and an output face said one end surface of the optical parametric oscillator crystal optically facing another end surface of the Q switch wherein an output coupler is placed on said output face of the optical parametric oscillator crystal and a curved surface external cavity partial reflector having said curved surface disposed to optically face said output coupler.

An ouput coupler can be placed on the output face of the OPO crystal . The output coupler can consist of coatings for the OPO cavity as exemplified in . Coatings on the output face of the OPO cavity can therefore serve as the output coupler of the 1064 nm pump cavity as shown in . For example the output face of the OPO crystal can have High Reflection Coating of HR 1064 nm and PR 1570 nm which serve to function as an output coupler . As also shows the alignment of the OPO conversion cavity is solely due to the tolerance achieved in the fabrication process of the OPO crystal how well the face face parallelism is since the OPO cavity coatings are processed onto the crystal faces e.g. and or . This leads to a simple alignment of only the 1064 nm pump cavity of the monoblock . The pump cavity can be aligned fairly well in order to produce an appreciable output. In contrast a malalignment of the OPO cavity can lead to a poor output beam quality.

As further exemplified in an output coupler can be placed on the output face of the OPO crystal . The output coupler can consist of coatings for the OPO cavity as exemplified in . Coatings on the output face of the OPO cavity can therefore serve as the output coupler of the 1064 nm pump cavity as shown in . For example the output face of the OPO crystal can have High Reflection Coating of HR 1064 nm and PR 1570 nm which serve to function as an output coupler optically facing the external cavity partial reflector to produce a 1.57 m output.

One end surface of the external cavity partial reflector facing the output coupler can have a surface coating e.g. Anti Reflection Coating of AR 1570 nm. Another end surface of the external cavity partial reflector can a surface coating e.g. PR 1570 nm to produce 1.57 m improved beam output. As exemplified the external cavity partial reflector serves two purposes. First it lengthens the Optical Parametric Oscillator OPO cavity e.g. from the 1OPO cavity length to the 2OPO cavity length as exemplified in which lowers the total number of longitudinal modes capable of being supported within the laser resonator. The second and more important purpose is that the external cavity partial reflector is aligned to ONLY the back reflector of the OPO resonator.

In contrast the output coupler which is placed on the output face of the OPO crystal as seen in original monoblock laser is optically aligned with the 1064 nm pump cavity and alignment to the OPO conversion cavity is fixed by crystal fabrication The output coupler is thus seldom perfect due to real world fabrication inaccuracies for both cavities as configured in .

The external cavity partial reflector being optically aligned to only the OPO cavity s back reflector can optimize the OPO resonator s performance. Optimal performance can be achieved by aligning only to the OPO back reflector and by creating a longer OPO cavity as seen . This greatly reduces the number of higher order lasing modes generated which leads to a much improved beam quality.

A Monoblock Laser Cavity Arrangement with a Curved External Partial Reflector for Improved Beam Quality

The monoblock laser cavity arrangements discussed above related to a flat flat cavity. Alternatively a curved surface can be added to an exemplary external cavity partial reflector as shown in . This will make the cavity an unstable cavity which would make it less sensitive to angular deviations of the mirrors with respect to the optical axis. Such an alternative arrangement can also mitigate the number of modes allowed to propogate within the laser cavity the higher order mode are subjected to more loss so the output leaving the laser cavity consists of the lower order modes for a better beam quality.

As further exemplified in an ouput coupler can be placed on the output face of the OPO crystal . The output coupler can consist of coatings for the OPO cavity as exemplified in . For example the output face of the OPO crystal can have High Reflection Coating of HR 1064 nm and PR 1570 nm which serve to function as an output coupler optically facing the external cavity partial reflector to produce a 1.57 m output. The curved end surface of the external cavity partial reflector facing the output coupler can have a surface coating e.g. PR 1570 nm. Another end surface of the external cavity partial reflector can have a surface coating e.g. Anti Reflection Coating of AR 1570 nm to produce a 1.57 m improved beam output.

The overall output energy of such an alternative exemplary embodiment of the monoblock laser cavity with an external cavity partial reflector may be slightly less than that of the other exemplary embodiments of monoblock laser cavity how much depends on the amount of 1.5 micron reflection selected for the external cavity partial reflector from 10 to 80 for typical monoblock laser cavities . But the achievable far field beam divergence can be significantly less to yield an overall increase in the laser s brightness . Accordingly a smaller afocal can be used in a laser range finder system incorporating such embodiments.

The various embodiments as disclosed can improve the brightness of the monoblock laser tighter beam divergence . The tighter beam divergence improved brightness of the improved monoblock laser allows for use of a smaller diameter optic to collimate the laser output for use in a laser range finder.

The various exemplary embodiments can be small with minimal impact to the monoblock. They can utilize known bonding techniques for monoblock construction.

The monoblock laser with improved beam quality through use of a 1.5 micron external cavity partial reflector is still a simple module that requires none of the labor extensive alignment procedures as alternative laser range finder solid state laser sources. No optical holders have to be fabricated no complex engineering is required to design the optical cavity and no precise laser cavity alignment s are required. Production labor and material costs are greatly reduced.

The improved monoblock laser cavity is a modular component. The modularity lends to ease of configuration for different pump sources. It can be incorporated in a flash lamp pumped or laser diode pumped system.

The various exemplary embodiments may be used as the laser source in very compact laser range finders. For example they cant generate eye safe laser output for eye safe laser range finding. These laser range finders can have both military and commercial applications. The compact configuration of the improved monoblock laser cavity also lends itself to placement in other laser based portable hand held devices. These may be medical devices industrial tools or scientific equipment that would benefit from the size weight reduction dependable performance and low cost.

It is obvious that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described.
