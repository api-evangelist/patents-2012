The present disclosure relates to a workpiece machining apparatus which is used in forming keyways splines gears or the like in a workpiece.

When a keyway is formed in a through hole of a workpiece a reciprocating tool such as a slotter and a broach is used. That is the keyway is formed in the through hole by causing the reciprocating tool to reciprocate like a chisel in an axial direction of the through hole.

However when the reciprocating tool is used a tip of the reciprocating tool collides with a body portion of the workpiece in the vertical direction. Accordingly a sharp tip is required in the reciprocating tool. For this reason very accurate polishing of a tool tip is required. Therefore the present inventor has examined a method of forming a keyway in a through hole of a workpiece by using a rotary tool which does not require very accurate polishing of the tool tip.

However a rotary tool unit having the rotary tool radial tool or the like to be described later is supported by a tool rest in a cantilevered manner. The rotary tool is rotated around its own axis. Consequently there is a possibility that the rotary tool unit may be vibrated or elastically deformed due to a machining load generated by the rotation of the rotary tool. Therefore there is a possibility that machining accuracy may be degraded.

In this regard according to an inner surface machining apparatus disclosed in PTL 1 a tool is supported from both sides in a Z axis direction. However the tool used in the inner surface machining apparatus disclosed in PTL 1 is a tool for lathe machining stationary tool and is not a rotary tool. Accordingly PTL 1 does not suggest and disclose a solution for the above described problem problem in that the machining accuracy may be degraded which is inherent in the rotary tool.

A workpiece machining apparatus according to the disclosure has been realized in view of the above described problem. The disclosure aims to provide a workpiece machining apparatus whose machining accuracy is less likely to be degraded.

In order to solve the above described problem a workpiece machining apparatus according to the disclosure comprises a headstock to which a workpiece is attached when coordinate axes orthogonal to each other are set to a Z axis and an X axis a tool rest being movable in the Z axis direction and the X axis direction and a rotary tool unit attached to the tool rest wherein the headstock has a support member being movable in the Z axis direction the support member has a spindle side contact portion in an end portion in the Z axis direction wherein the rotary tool unit has a tool body having a tool side contact portion with which the spindle side contact portion of the support member can come into contact in the Z axis direction and a tool protruding from the tool body and being rotatable around its own axis wherein the tool which is rotating machines the workpiece by moving the tool body in the Z axis direction in a state where the spindle side contact portion and the tool side contact portion are brought into contact with each other.

According to the workpiece machining apparatus of the disclosure by the support member it is possible to hold the rotary tool unit in the Z axis direction. Accordingly it is possible to suppress vibrations or elastic deformation of the tool. Therefore machining accuracy is less likely to be degraded.

In another embodiment of the disclosure a configuration may be adopted wherein when a coordinate axis orthogonal to the Z axis and the X axis is set to a Y axis the tool protrudes from the tool body in the Y axis direction wherein the workpiece has a through hole which extends in the Z axis direction and wherein the tool forms a groove extending in the Z axis direction in the through hole by moving the tool body inside the through hole in the Z axis direction.

An example of a rotary tool includes a radial tool. The radial tool is used when a hole is bored into an outer peripheral surface of the workpiece. The radial tool is movable in the Z axis direction spindle direction and the X axis direction direction orthogonal to the Z axis by a slide mechanism. The axial direction of the radial tool is the X axis direction.

When the hole is bored into the outer peripheral surface of the workpiece the radial tool is first rotated around its own axis. Thereafter the rotary tool unit including the radial tool is moved in the Z axis direction on an outer side in a radial direction of the outer peripheral surface of the workpiece fixed to a chuck. Subsequently in the coordinates for boring the hole a movement direction of the rotary tool unit is switched from the Z axis direction to the X axis direction. Then a tip of the rotating radial tool is pressed against the outer peripheral surface of the workpiece. In this manner the hole extending in the X axis direction is bored into the outer peripheral surface of the workpiece.

Here the axial direction boring direction of the radial tool is the X axis direction. In addition the movement direction of the radial tool is only in the Z axis direction and the X axis direction. Accordingly if the radial tool is diverted into another use when the groove is formed in the through hole of the workpiece the Z axis direction is caused to correspond to an extending direction of the groove and the X axis direction is caused to correspond to a depth direction of the groove.

However in this case the radial tool cannot be moved in a groove width direction Y axis direction direction orthogonal to the Z axis and the X axis . Therefore a groove width of the groove cannot be widened.

In this regard according to this configuration the tool protrudes in the Y axis direction with respect to the tool rest which is movable in the Z axis direction and the X axis direction. The Y axis direction corresponds to the groove depth direction of the groove. The X axis direction corresponds to the groove width direction of the groove. Therefore the groove width of the groove can be widened by moving the tool rest in the X axis direction.

In addition if the tool protrudes in the X axis direction the X axis direction is caused to correspond to the groove depth direction of the groove and the Y axis direction is caused to correspond to the groove width direction of the groove. Accordingly in order to ensure a groove width widening function it is necessary to increase movement of a mechanism for example a slide or the like in the Y axis direction for the existing tool rest. In contrast according to this configuration it is possible to use the existing tool rest tool rest movable in the Z axis direction and the X axis direction without any change therein. Therefore the apparatus is very versatile.

In another embodiment of the disclosure a configuration may be adopted wherein the spindle side contact portion and the tool side contact portion are engageable with each other in a state of being deviated from each other in the X axis direction. In order to widen the groove width of the groove it is necessary to cause the tool side contact portion to be deviated from the spindle side contact portion in the X axis direction. In this regard according to this configuration even when the tool side contact portion is deviated from the spindle side contact portion it is possible to ensure an engagement state between the spindle side contact portion and the tool side contact portion. Therefore it is possible to suppress vibrations or elastic deformation of the tool even when the groove width is widened.

In another embodiment of the disclosure a configuration may be adopted wherein any one of the spindle side contact portion and the tool side contact portion has an engagement rib extending in the X axis direction and the other one has an engagement groove portion extending in the X axis direction the engagement rib is inserted into the engagement groove portion.

According to this configuration even when the tool side contact portion is deviated from the spindle side contact portion it is possible to ensure an engagement state between the engagement rib and the engagement groove portion. Therefore it is possible to suppress vibrations or elastic deformation of the tool even when the groove width is widened.
