This application is related to commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 446 937 titled Athletic Activity Monitoring Methods and Systems filed on Apr. 13 2012 and commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 466 982 titled Sport Ball Athletic Activity Monitoring Methods and Systems filed on Apr. 13 2012 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to wearable athletic activity monitoring methods and systems. More particularly embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and systems for monitoring the movement of an individual engaged in an athletic activity during the athletic activity.

Athletic activity is important to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and is a source of entertainment for many people. Some individuals prefer to engage in team athletic activities such as for example soccer or basketball while other individuals prefer to engage in individual athletic activities such as for example running or skiing. Regardless of whether the activity is a team or individual activity it is common for individuals to participate in both competitive sessions such as a soccer match or a running race and more informal training sessions such as conducting soccer drills or running interval sprints.

Technology has resulted in the development of fitness monitoring devices that are capable of recording information about an individual s performance during an athletic activity using sensors and in some cases providing feedback about the individual s performance. Some portable fitness monitoring devices employ sensors attached to the individual s body while other portable fitness monitoring devices rely on sensors attached to a piece of athletic equipment. Such sensors may be capable of measuring various physical and or physiological parameters associated with the individual s physical activity.

Many existing fitness monitoring devices are not portable and thus are not suitable for monitoring in many real world competitive or training sessions. Even those that are portable are often too heavy or lack sufficient battery and or processing power to be used for extended periods under rigorous competitive or training conditions. In addition while some existing fitness monitoring devices are capable of making relatively simple performance determinations such as an individual s current heart rate or total step count for an activity more advanced determinations are often not possible or suffer from accuracy issues. Finally the performance feedback provided by existing devices to individuals often fails to provide these individuals with quick accurate insightful information that would enable them to easily compare past performances develop strategies for improving future performances visualize performances or select new training regimens or athletic equipment.

What is needed are new athletic activity monitoring methods and systems having improved capabilities thus offering individuals engaged in athletic activities better tools to assess their activities. At least some of the embodiments of the present invention satisfy the above needs and provide further related advantages as will be made apparent by the description that follows.

Data obtained by sensors may be processed in a variety of ways to yield useful information about the motion of an object of interest during the activity. In some embodiments sensor data may be processed to monitor changes in the spatial orientation i.e. changes in the position and or rotation relative to a specific location on the Earth or other point of reference of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment. In other embodiment sensor data may be processed to by reference to a predetermined correlation between movement data and an activity metric stored in a data structure.

In one embodiment information about the motion of the individual s body or the motion of a piece of the individual s athletic equipment may be used for example to provide coaching to the individual about how their movements could be improved or as a check on the accuracy of a referee umpire or other athletic competition judge s judgment related to the movement of the individual s body or athletic equipment.

Athletic activity monitoring systems according to embodiments of the present invention may be suitable for use by individuals for team or individual athletic activities and for competitive and informal training sessions.

As a further example to the extent that the sensor module has insufficient processing power wide area network transmission capabilities sensor capabilities or other capabilities these capabilities can be provided by other components of the athletic activity monitoring system . With this in mind possible communications means are described briefly below.

Wired communication between the sensor module and a personal computer may be achieved for example by placing the sensor module in a docking unit that is attached to the personal computer using a communications wire plugged into a communications port of the personal computer . In another embodiment wired communication between the sensor module and the personal computer may be achieved for example by connecting a cable between the sensor module and the computer .

As previously explained above in some embodiments such cables could be used to facilitate power transfer to a power source of the sensor module in order to charge the power source . Alternatively the power source may be recharged by inductive charging or by using a docking station.

Wired connection to a personal computer may be useful for example to upload athletic activity information from the sensor module to the personal computer or to download application software updates or settings from the personal computer to the sensor module .

Wireless communication between the sensor module and the personal computer may be achieved for example by way of a wireless wide area network such as for example the Internet a wireless local area network or a wireless personal area network. As is well known to those skilled in the art there are a number of known standard and proprietary protocols that are suitable for implementing wireless area networks e.g. TCP IP IEEE 802.16 Bluetooth Bluetooth low energy ANT ANT by Dynastream Innovations or BlueRobin . Accordingly embodiments of the present invention are not limited to using any particular protocol to communicate between the sensor module and the various elements of the athletic activity monitoring system of the present invention.

In one embodiment the sensor module may communicate with a wireless wide area network communications system such as that employed by mobile telephones. For example a wireless wide area network communication system may include a plurality of geographically distributed communication towers and base station systems. Communication towers may include one or more antennae supporting long range two way radio frequency communication wireless devices such as sensor module . The radio frequency communication between antennae and the sensor module may utilize radio frequency signals conforming to any known or future developed wireless protocol for example CDMA GSM EDGE 3G 4G IEEE 802.x e.g. IEEE 802.16 WiMAX etc. The information transmitted over the air by the base station systems and the cellular communication towers to the sensor module may be further transmitted to or received from one or more additional circuit switched or packet switched communication networks including for example the Internet.

As shown in communication may also occur between the sensor module a personal computer and or a remote server via a network . In an embodiment the network is the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide collection of servers routers switches and transmission lines that employ the Internet Protocol TCP IP to communicate data. The network may also be employed for communication between any two or more of the sensor module the personal computer the server and a docking unit. In an embodiment of the present invention information is directly communicated between the sensor module and the server via the network thus bypassing the personal computer .

A variety of information may be communicated between any of the sensor module the personal computer the network the server or other electronic components such as for example another sensor module a mobile phone a tablet computer or other portable electronic devices. Such information may include for example performance parameter data device settings including sensor module settings software and firmware.

Communication among the various elements of the present invention may occur after the athletic activity has been completed or in real time during the athletic activity. In addition the interaction between for example the sensor module and the personal computer and the interaction between the personal computer and the server may occur at different times.

In some embodiments of the present invention an individual using the athletic activity monitoring system may participate in the activity with the sensor module physically coupled to the individual s body or to a piece of athletic equipment but with no other portable electronic devices making up part of the athletic activity monitoring system in the individual s immediate vicinity. In such an embodiment the sensor module would monitor the athletic activity using its sensors. The sensor module may also perform calculations necessary to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment or perform calculations necessary to determine a correlation between body or equipment movement data and an activity metric.

Alternatively in this scenario other components of the athletic activity monitoring system that are remotely located from the individual during the activity could be relied upon to perform calculations necessary to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment or perform calculations necessary to determine a correlation between body or equipment movement data and an activity metric. This could occur for example after wireless transmission of athletic performance information directly from the sensor module to a personal computer or a server during or after the activity or after a wired transmission of athletic performance information directly from the sensor module to a personal computer after the activity.

However in other embodiments of the present invention as illustrated in the sensor module may communicate with a portable electronic device of the athletic activity monitoring system that is also carried by the individual during the athletic activity. In some embodiments the portable electronic device may be a watch a mobile phone a tablet computer or other portable electronic device.

The portable electronic device may serve a variety of purposes including for example providing additional data processing providing additional data storage providing data visualization providing additional sensor capabilities relaying information to a network or providing for the playback of music.

In one embodiment of the present invention the portable electronic device may be a dedicated portable electronic device . The term dedicated portable electronic device indicates that the portable electronic device is not capable of serving another purpose outside of the athletic activity monitoring system of the present invention. For example a mobile phone a personal digital assistant or a digital music file player e.g. an MP3 player may not be considered to be dedicated portable electronic monitoring devices as the term is used herein.

An overview of exemplary embodiments of components of the athletic activity monitoring system of the present invention including exemplary sensor modules has been provided above. A description of various exemplary methods of using the athletic activity monitoring system of the present invention to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment or to determine a correlation between body or equipment movement data and an activity metric is now provided below.

An individual engaged in an athletic activity or another interested person such as a coach teammate or spectator may desire to obtain information about the motion of the individual s body or the motion of a piece of the individual s athletic equipment during the course of the athletic activity.

For example if the individual is participating in an activity that involves the use of a sport ball such as playing in a soccer match it may be desirable for example to be able to determine the various launch angles at which the soccer ball i.e. football was kicked by the individual to be able to determine the rate of rotation of the soccer ball after it was kicked by the individual or to be able to determine the peak speeds that the soccer ball was traveling at after being kicked by the individual .

As a further example if the individual is participating in an activity that involves various movements the individual s chest such practicing basketball skills it may be desirable for example to be able to identify instances when the individual cut to the left or cut to the right when trying to dribble around a defender to be able to determine the height that the individual jumped or the force that the individual jumped with when taking jump shots attempting dunks or attempting to block shots or to be able to determine the individual s reaction time when working on basketball related reaction time drills.

By using the athletic activity monitoring system including the sensor module described above embodiments of the present invention may advantageously enable the individual or their coach teammate or a spectator to obtain this or other information about the motion of the individual s body or the motion of a piece of the individual s athletic equipment during or after the course of the athletic activity.

While various embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of the sports of soccer i.e. football and basketball the present invention is not so limited and may be applied in a variety of different sports or athletic activities including for example baseball bowling boxing cricket cycling football i.e. American football golf hockey lacrosse rowing rugby running skateboarding skiing surfing swimming table tennis tennis or volleyball or during training sessions related thereto. In addition activity metrics described as being capable of being determined in soccer may be capable of being determined in basketball or vice versa when appropriate.

Data obtained by the sensor module may be processed in a variety of ways to yield useful information about the motion of an object of interest during the activity. In some embodiments sensor module data may be processed to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment . In other embodiment sensor module data may be processed to by reference to a predetermined correlation between movement data and an activity metric stored in a data structure.

Regardless of whether the athletic activity monitoring system and the sensor module are being used to monitor the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment in embodiments of the present invention where there is a desire to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of the individual s body or the piece of the individual s athletic equipment a common analytical framework may be used to carry out the monitoring. This analytical framework is illustrated by .

With reference to in such an embodiment the individual may use the sensor module in the athletic activity monitoring system to determine a change in spatial orientation of the object according to spatial orientation process as follows.

First at step the sensor module may detect movement of the object . In one embodiment movement of the object is detected based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

In one embodiment the magnetic field sensor may be adapted to measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields in the vicinity of the sensor module . In another embodiment the magnetic field sensor may be adapted to measure the strength and direction of the earth s magnetic field in the vicinity of the sensor module . In some embodiments the magnetic field sensor may be capable of measuring the magnitude and direction of a resultant magnetic vector for the total local magnetic field and or for the local earth s magnetic field.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the detected movement may consist of the soccer ball rolling on the ground as a result of being dribbled by the individual . If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the detected movement may consist of the individual s chest moving forward as the individual dribbles a basketball down the court.

In some embodiments the sensor module may then determine that the movement of the object indicates the occurrence of a movement to track. In one embodiment the determination that the movement of the object indicates the occurrence of a movement to track occurs when a threshold data value is met for a predetermined period of time. For example the sensor module may determine that a movement of the object has resulted in a threshold acceleration and or magnetic field change occurring for a predetermined period of time.

In some embodiments the determination of the occurrence of a movement to track is an indication that the movement to track had already begun prior to the determination. In this case it is still possible to capture all of the relevant data relating to the movement as the sensor module may temporarily record a stream of data in a buffer in the event that data that had recently been recorded may need to be examined or more permanently recorded in response to a determination that an occurrence of a movement to track is found. In other embodiments the determination of the occurrence of a movement to track is an indication that the movement to track is about to begin in the near future. In some embodiments the sensor module is adapted to store data permanently or temporarily and may further be adapted to store data for predefined periods of time in certain circumstances such as when populating a data buffer.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball in an attempt to make a goal may result in a determination that the motion of the ball in response to the kick which could include motion of the ball before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the rotation of the individual s chest through one hundred and eighty degrees of rotation when making an offensive movement may result in a determination that the rotation of the individual s chest which could include motion of the individual s chest before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked.

Next as step in response to the determination of the occurrence of a movement to track an initial spatial orientation of the object may be determined. In some embodiments the determination of an initial spatial orientation of the object may be made by reference to a coordinate axis system.

A coordinate axis system is a useful analytical tool for monitoring changes in the spatial orientation of an object . illustrates an exemplary three dimensional Cartesian coordinate axis system having three axes an X axis a Y axis and a Z axis. Two vectors G and B are superimposed on the coordinate axis system illustrated in . The G vector pointing in the Y direction represents a gravity vector. The B vector represents a resultant magnetic field vector.

Returning to the discussion of step in one embodiment the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the object may be made with respect to a gravity vector such as that illustrated in . In another embodiment the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the object may be made with respect to an earth magnetic field vector such as that illustrated in . In other embodiments the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the object may be made with respect to characterizations of the way that the object translated and rotated in three dimensional space with six degrees of freedom as explained with reference to .

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the soccer ball relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. movement of the ball resulting from the kick may be defined for example as the spatial orientation of the soccer ball just before at the moment of or just after the soccer ball was swiftly kicked by the individual s foot depending on the particular application and algorithms used. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the determination of the initial spatial orientation of the individual s chest relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. the one hundred and eighty degree rotation may be defined for example as the spatial orientation of the individual s chest just before at the moment of or just after the individual s chest began rotating depending on the particular application and algorithms used.

At step after the determination of the initial orientation of the object at a first time has been made a change in the spatial orientation of the object may be determined. In an embodiment the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the object at step may be made similarly to the determination of the initial orientation of the object at step except that additional information about changes in the orientation of the gravity vector and or the magnetic field vector as the object moves may be additionally factored in.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the soccer ball relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. movement of the ball resulting from the kick may be defined for example as the change in spatial orientation of the soccer ball from the time that the initial orientation of the soccer ball was identified to a later point in time when the ball is still moving or has ceased moving depending on the particular application and algorithms used. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest relative to the specific movement to be tracked i.e. the one hundred and eighty degree rotation may be defined for example as the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest from the time that the initial orientation of the individual s chest was identified to a later point in time when the individual s chest is still moving or has ceased moving depending on the particular application and algorithms used.

At step an activity metric is determined based on the change in the spatial orientation of the object determined in step . The nature of the activity metric may change based on the athletic activity that the individual is participating in as well as particular object that is being monitored. In one embodiment the activity metric may relate to for example a launch angle a rate of rotation a speed a jump height a jump force a jump distance a kick force a kick distance a characterization of a specific type of athletic movement or a reaction time measurement. In other embodiments the activity metric may be for example the rate of rotation the plane of rotation the jump force force profile force acting upon the body of the athlete or the ground or the object stroke information in tennis swing profile in golf baseball hockey stick kick profile of a leg angle position of a bike pedal power output of a cyclist fatigue tremors starting to occur in repeated motion i.e. running lifting swimming rowing etc. posture throwing or arm swing technique and shooting technique.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the change in the spatial orientation of the ball resulting from the kick may be used to determine for example a launch angle of the ball a rate of rotation of the ball launch speed estimated speed or similar metrics. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest during the one hundred and eighty degree rotation may be used to determine for example that the individual had been posting up a defender and then executed a one hundred and eighty degree spin move to maneuver around the defender or similar metrics. In other embodiments the change in the spatial orientation of the individual s chest may be used to determine a jump height or jump force.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the activity metric to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. In one embodiment the output may be an audible visual and or haptic output.

In some embodiments of the present invention instead of a desire to monitor changes in the spatial orientation of an object of interest there may be a desire to correlate movements of objects such as the individual s body or the piece of the individual s athletic equipment to activity metrics based on a predetermined correlation stored in a data structure. A common analytical framework may be used to carry out such correlations. This analytical framework is illustrated by .

With reference to in such an embodiment the individual may use the sensor module in the athletic activity monitoring system to determine such correlations to object movement according to movement correlation process as follows.

First at step the sensor module may detect movement of the object . This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process as described above.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the detected movement may consist of the soccer ball rolling on the ground as a result of being dribbled by the individual . If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the detected movement may consist of the individual s chest moving forward as the individual dribbles a basketball down the court.

In some embodiments the sensor module may then determine that the movement of the object indicates the occurrence of a movement to track. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process as described above.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball in an attempt to make a goal may result in a determination that the motion of the ball in response to the kick which could include motion of the ball before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the movement of the individual s chest sharply upward away from the ground as a result of the individual jumping to for example take a jump shot attempt a dunk or attempt to block a shot may result in a determination that the upward movement of the individual s chest which could include motion of the individual s chest before during and or after the determination was made should be tracked.

Next at step the sensor module may record movement data in response to identifying a movement to track. In one embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball may be recorded. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the movement of the individual s chest sharply upward may be recorded.

Next at step the sensor module may determine a correlation between the recorded movement data and an activity metric. In one embodiment this determination may be based on correlation information stored in a data structure such as a lookup table.

A lookup table is a data structure usually an array or associative array often used to replace a runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation. The savings in terms of processing time can be significant since retrieving a value from memory is often faster than undergoing relatively processing expensive computation or input output operation. Lookup table figures may be pre calculated and stored in static program storage or pre fetched as part of a program initialization phase.

The nature of the correlation may depend on the particular application and algorithms used to establish the correlation. Also the nature of the activity metric may change based on the athletic activity that the individual is participating in as well as particular object that is being monitored. In one embodiment the activity metric may relate to for example a launch angle a rate of rotation a speed a jump height a jump force a characterization of a specific type of athletic movement or a reaction time measurement. In other embodiments the activity metric may be for example the rate of rotation the plane of rotation the jump force force profile force acting upon the body of the athlete or the ground or the object stroke information in tennis swing profile in golf baseball hockey stick kick profile of a leg angle position of a bike pedal power output of a cyclist fatigue tremors starting to occur in repeated motion i.e. running lifting swimming rowing etc. posture throwing or arm swing technique and shooting technique.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the correlation between the recorded movement data and an activity metric may rely on correlation data stored in a data structure that was derived from a function that expresses a relationship between soccer ball acceleration data and soccer ball launch speed metrics. In some embodiments the function underlying the relationship between soccer ball acceleration data and soccer ball launch speed may be based on empirical data for the specific model soccer ball.

If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the correlation between the recorded movement data and an activity metric may rely correlation data stored in a data structure that was derived from a function that expresses a relationship between chest acceleration data and for example jump height or jump force metrics. In some embodiments the function underlying the relationship between chest acceleration data and jump height may be based on data such as for example the individual s weight.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the activity metric to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process as described above.

The analytical frameworks outlined with respect to and detailing the basic spatial orientation process and the basic movement correlation process respectively may be used in embodiments of the present invention to monitor the individual s body or a piece of the individual s athletic equipment using a sensor module . However in some embodiments of the present invention these basic analytical frameworks may include additional steps that may provide improved capabilities thus offering the individual engaged in athletic activities better tools to assess their activities.

With reference to the active state process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the active state process may occur just prior to the steps of the basic spatial orientation process or the basic movement correlation process so that these processes may be carried out with more efficient sensor module function.

At step the sensor module may detect movement of the object at a first time. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process or step of the movement correlation process as described above.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the detected movement may consist of the soccer ball rolling on the ground as a result of being dribbled by the individual . If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the detected movement may consist of the individual s chest moving forward as the individual dribbles a basketball down the court.

Next at step the sensor module may determine that the movement of the object corresponds to a predetermined activation movement. In some embodiments the predetermined activation movement may include a series of discrete movements such as for example a ball being bounced three times in series the ball being thrown a predetermined height the ball being kicked with a certain level of force the individual jumping up and down three times in series or a movement that results in the acceleration of the sensor module exceeding and or falling below a predetermined threshold in absolute terms or for a predetermined period of time. In one embodiment movement of the object is detected based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is detected based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

The step of determining that the movement of the object corresponds to a predetermined activation movement may include comparing acceleration data associated with the predetermined activation movement to acceleration data detected in association with the movement of the object. Alternatively the step of determining that the movement of the object corresponds to a predetermined activation movement may include comparing timing data associated with the predetermined activation movement to timing data detected in association with the movement of the object.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the predetermined activation movement could be for example movement of the soccer ball after it had been stationary for a predetermined period of time the soccer ball being bounced three times the soccer ball being thrown into the air a certain height of period of time or a variety of other possible activation movements. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the predetermined activation movement could be for example movement of the individual s chest after the individual had been stationary for a predetermined period of time e.g. sitting on the bench the individual jumping up and down three times in a row the individual squatting three times in a row or a variety of other possible activation movements.

In some embodiments the monitored object can be considered stationary when the sensor module of the monitored object senses resultant acceleration of about 1 G i.e. resultant acceleration within a threshold tolerance of 1 G for example within 5 of 1 G . In some embodiments the monitored object can be considered stationary at times while being handled by an individual. For example a ball can be stationary for a period of time within a period of time in which a basketball player takes a jump shot with ball e.g. before release of ball from the hands of the individual ball can be considered stationary where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G . Also for example the ball can be stationary for a period of time within a period of time in which a baseball player performs a throw of ball e.g. a period of time spanning the transition from rearward motion to forward motion of the individual s throwing motion where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G .

Next at step after determining that an activation movement has occurred the sensor module may enter the active state. As previously described the active state may be characterized for example by the sensor module consuming more power or sampling data at a higher rate during the active state than prior to the active state.

Finally at step upon the sensor module entering the active state detection of movement of the object at a second time as detailed at step of the basic spatial orientation process or at step of the basic movement correlation process . In this way enabling various states may allow the sensor module to operate with reduced battery power reduced processing power or otherwise be more efficient.

With reference to the reference motion process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the reference motion process may effectively be substituted for step and of the basic movement correlation process outlined above so that the correlation and identification capabilities are enhanced.

At step the sensor module may record movement data possibly in response to identifying a movement to track in a previous step as outlined above . In one embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on acceleration data captured by the acceleration sensor of the sensor module . In another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on magnetic field data captured by the magnetic field sensor of the sensor module . In yet another embodiment movement of the object is recorded based on both acceleration data and magnetic field data.

If the monitored object is a soccer ball the movement of the soccer ball as a result of the individual swiftly kicking the ball may be recorded. If the monitored object is the chest of an individual playing basketball the movement of the individual s chest sharply upward may be recorded.

Next at step the sensor module may identify a matching athletic motion from a plurality of reference motions by comparing the movement data to data associated with the plurality of reference motions. In one embodiment as with step of the basic movement correlation process the identification may be made at least in part based on correlation information stored in a data structure such as a lookup table.

Particular to step identification of the matching athletic motion may be by reference to a plurality of reference motions. In other words at step the system is not limited to looking for a motion that matches a single motion e.g. kicking a soccer ball in an effort to score a goal . In some embodiments the system is not limited to looking for a motion that matches a single class of motions e.g. offensive soccer motions . In other embodiments the system is not limited to looking for a motion that matches motions in a single sport e.g. soccer motions . Alternatively when the activity is a team sport the matching athletic motion may be a motion commonly executed by a person during that team sport.

In one embodiment one or more of the reference motions may include a series of discrete movements. In some embodiments data associated with the plurality of reference motions may include acceleration data magnetic field data and or timing data. Of course the nature of the identifying matching athletic motion may depend on the particular application and algorithms used to establish the match. Also the nature of the matching athletic motion may change based on the athletic activity that the individual is participating in as well as particular object that is being monitored. In one embodiment related to basketball the matching athletic motion may be for example a pass motion an shot motion an jump shot motion a dunk motion a post up motion a cross over dribble motion a shot blocking motion a steal motion or a rebound motion.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the matching athletic motion to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the movement correlation process as described above. In this way the athletic motion identification capabilities of the movement correlation process may be enhanced by enabling identification and tracking of diverse types of motions executed during an activity.

With reference to the remote spatial processing or correlation process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the remote spatial processing or correlation process may effectively be substituted for step of the basic spatial orientation process or step of the basic movement correlation process outlined above so that activity metric determination may occur remotely.

At step a change in the spatial orientation of the object may be determined or movement data may be recorded. In an embodiment the determination of the change in the spatial orientation of the object or the recordation of movement data at step may be made similarly to the determination of the change in spatial orientation of the object at step of the basic spatial orientation process outlined above or to the recording of movement data at step of the basic movement correlation process .

Next at step the sensor module may wirelessly transmit data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement to a computer wherein the computer is remotely located from the user during the athletic activity. For example the remote computer may be server . In one embodiment the data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement may be transmitted to the remote computer during the athletic activity. In another embodiment the data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement may be transmitted to the remote computer after the athletic activity has been completed.

Next at step the sensor module may wirelessly receive activity metric data from the remote computer wherein the activity metric data is based on the transmitted data relating to the change in spatial orientation or to movement. Accordingly the determination of the activity metric as outlined for example at step of the basic spatial orientation process the determination of the activity metric based on correlation data possibly with reference to a lookup table as outlined for example at step of the basic movement correlation process may be handled by the remote computer. In one embodiment the activity metric data may be received from the remote computer during the athletic activity. In another embodiment the activity metric data may be received from the remote computer after the athletic activity has been completed.

In addition in certain embodiments because of the greater processing capabilities and resources of the remote computer the remote computer may be capable of providing additional information to the sensor module . In one embodiment the sensor module may receive training recommendation data from the remote computer in addition to the activity metric data. In another embodiment the sensor module may receive motivational content data from the remote computer in addition to the activity metric data.

In an embodiment the activity metric data received from the remote computer may include a comparison between data associated with the user for the present athletic activity and data associated with the user from a previous athletic activity. In another embodiment the activity metric data received from the remote computer may include a comparison between data associated with the user for the present athletic activity and data associated with a different individual s athletic activity.

Finally at step an output is provided that conveys the activity metric to the individual a coach a teammate a spectator or any other interested person. This step may be carried out in a similar fashion to step of the spatial orientation process or to step of the movement correlation process as described above. In this way the spatial processing or movement determining capabilities of the athletic activity monitoring system may be enhanced by shifting certain processing and analytical tasks to a remotely located computer such as a server computer with greater computational abilities and in some embodiments access to additional data or other resources.

With reference to the location process begins as step . In one embodiment the steps of the location process may occur after the steps of the basic spatial orientation process or the basic movement correlation process or just prior to the output steps of these processes.

At step the activity metric may be determined based on a change in the spatial orientation of the object as described at step of the spatial orientation process or based on the correlation described at step of the movement correlation process .

In one embodiment the activity metric may relate to for example a launch angle a rate of rotation a speed a jump height jump force a characterization of a specific type of athletic movement or a reaction time measurement.

The sensor module may be capable of being used to determine whether these movements are being done correctly and or how many repetitions of each movement were conducted.

In some embodiments of the present invention the sensor module may be capable of compensating for inherent deficiencies that may be present for various types of sensor contained within or in communication with the sensor module . Most real world sensors have limitations. For example accelerometers magnetometers and gyroscopes may have accuracy issues particularly when used at speeds or under other conditions that differ from their initial calibration conditions.

In some systems if sensor data such as acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data is temporarily lost or otherwise unavailable the data from the unavailable sensor is not used in subsequent processing or calculations. In other systems lost data may be estimated by straight line methods where for example it is assumed that the data stays constant or changes at a constant rate. However in some embodiments of the present invention sensor data such as one of acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data may be used to compensate for and or estimate the changes in the other of acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data based on known derived or estimate correlations between the two types of data or data extrapolation.

By combining the data produced by for example acceleration sensor and a magnetic field sensor systems and methods according to embodiments of the present invention are able to more accurately determine absolute data values or activity metrics even when data from one of the acceleration sensor or the magnetic field sensor is lost for any reason. Using the data that is not missing the system can continue to provide data values or activity metrics to fill in the holes until the missing data is regained or otherwise again sampled.

In other embodiments of the present invention angular momentum sensor data such as gyroscope data may be used in combination with one or more of acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor data for data calibration and or extrapolation.

In some embodiments of the present invention calibration and or generation of correction factor data for an acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor based sensor modules may be performed under a variety of different use conditions e.g. calibration data or correction factors may be generated for use at different movement speeds for use with an individual s body with a piece of athletic equipment for use in different sports for use under different wind conditions for use under different court or field conditions etc. Moreover this variety of correction factors and or calibration data may be collected in the background over time as the individual continues using the system. In this manner a lookup table or other universe or library of calibration data or correction factors may be built up and stored in the monitoring system optionally in the portable portion of the system such that an appropriate correction factor could be generated and applied for a full range of individual or athletic equipment speeds and or other use conditions.

A microprocessor provided with the system optionally in the portable portion of the system in the personal computer etc. may be programmed to interpolate between and or extrapolate from known calibration or correction factors to arrive at the most appropriate calibration or correction factor for use at any speed or other use condition s . Also in this manner different calibration or correction factors may be applied at different times during a single athletic performance e.g. based on the speed or other use conditions determined at a given time during the performance to further help improve the overall accuracy of the speed and distance monitor. By having a variety of correction or calibration factors available under different performance conditions the sensor module will tend to become more accurate particularly over time and with increased use because of the increased number of calibration and correction factors generated with increased use.

In one embodiment of the present invention the sensor module may be affected by perturbations in local magnetic fields such as the earth s magnetic field. The local magnetic field may be more variable at certain distances near the surface of the earth than at other distances further away from the earth. For example the local magnetic field may be more variable or perturbed within approximately three feet of the surface of the earth than at more than approximately three feet away from the surface of the earth. Accordingly in some embodiments magnetic field sensor data obtained from an object when the object is more than approximately three feet away from the surface of the earth may be used to extrapolate or otherwise estimate proper or likely magnetic field sensor data from when the object was within approximately three feet of the surface of the earth if the magnetic field sensor data from when the object was within approximately three feet of the surface of the earth is otherwise deemed to be unreliable due to the relatively high variability in local magnetic fields such as the earth s magnetic field near the surface of the earth.

In some embodiments sensor module of monitoring system can be mounted to an individual . In some embodiments multiple sensor modules can be mounted to individual e.g. one sensor module having axes at one or more oblique angles to another sensor module . In some embodiments sensor modules may be mounted to individual at different locations e.g. on the trunk of individual on one or more appendages of individual . For example individual may be an athlete performing an athletic activity. Monitoring system including sensor module mounted to individual is referred to as monitoring system .

In some embodiments sensor module can be activated i.e. enter an active state in response to sensing an activation motion or movement of individual the terms motion and movement are used interchangeably herein . In some embodiments the activation motion may be for example jumping above a predetermined height jumping a predetermined number of times in within a predetermined period walking a predetermined number of steps. In some embodiments the activation motion may be for example a sequence of motions e.g. motion in response to three jumps performed in quick succession or within a predetermined time period such as for example 3 seconds . Upon activation sensor module begins to store e.g. in memory and or transfer sensed data to a remote device as described herein. In some embodiments in an active state sensor module may continuously sense data e.g. acceleration data data representative of acceleration is determined by acceleration sensor of sensor module and magnetic field data data representative of a magnetic field is determined by magnetic field sensor of sensor module . In some embodiments data is sensed by sensor module periodically e.g. every 50 milliseconds ms every 10 ms every 1 ms .

In some embodiments sensor module can be deactivated in response to sensing a deactivation motion individual . In some embodiments the deactivation motion may be for example any of the motions described above as an activation motion.

In some embodiments monitoring system can be used to define a motion. For example monitoring system can be used to define a motion made by individual in terms of data sensed by sensor module during performance of the motion. Monitoring system can perform operations as described herein to determine such activity metrics using any suitable components. For example sensing operations as described may be carried out by a sensor of sensor module of monitoring system e.g. acceleration sensor or magnetic field sensor as appropriate . Also for example operations involving processing of data e.g. identifying determining calculating storing may be carried out by processor of sensor module or by a processor of any other device of or in communication with monitoring system e.g. server personal computer or portable electronic device .

In some embodiments calibration data is sensed by sensor module when individual or at least sensor module is in a calibration state. In some embodiments sensor module is in a calibration state when sensor module is stationary e.g. with respect to an external coordinate system i.e. a coordinate system independent of sensor module such as for example coordinate system depicted in for a period of time e.g. 10 ms or longer . In some embodiments sensor module can be considered stationary when sensor module senses resultant acceleration of about 1 G i.e. resultant acceleration within a threshold tolerance of 1 G for example within 5 of 1 G . In some embodiments sensor module can be considered stationary at times while individual is performing a movement. For example sensor module can be stationary for a period of time within a period of time in which a basketball player jumps e.g. a period of time connecting spanning the transition from downward motion of individual while bending to initiation the jump to upward motion of individual to begin launch of the jump sensor module can be considered stationary where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G . Also for example sensor module can be stationary due to its location on individual though individual is performing a motion e.g. a sensor module connected to the foot of individual may be considered stationary each time the foot is planted during a running movement of individual where resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is about 1 G .

Sensor module is depicted in the calibration state in . Sensor module may be in the calibration state at any point relative to an athletic activity e.g. before during or after an athletic activity . In some embodiments sensor module is determined to be in a calibration state and calibration data can be sensed each time sensor module is stationary. In some embodiments sensor module is determined to be in a calibration state and calibration data can be sensed each time sensor module is stationary for more than a threshold duration e.g. 1 second where calibration data has not been sensed for a threshold duration e.g. 1 minute 10 minutes 30 minutes .

In some embodiments in the calibration state acceleration sensor of sensor module senses acceleration data. In some embodiments magnetic field sensor of sensor module senses magnetic field data e.g. data relating to the magnetic field of the Earth . In some embodiments calibration data includes both acceleration data and magnetic field data. In some embodiments calibration data includes one of acceleration data and magnetic field data.

In some embodiments in the calibration state the acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module is acceleration due to gravity which can be used by monitoring system to determine one or both of orientation of acceleration due to gravity with respect to sensor module and magnitude of acceleration due to gravity at sensor module together gravity vector .

In some embodiments in the calibration state magnetic field sensor of sensor module senses one or both of orientation of a magnetic field with respect to sensor module and magnitude of the magnetic field at sensor module together magnetic field vector .

In some embodiments sensor module senses calibration data that is to be relied upon for one or more subsequent calculations. In some embodiments the calibration data sensed when sensor module is in the calibration state can be used to establish external coordinate system . In some embodiments external coordinate system can be established by reference to the orientation of gravity vector e.g. to establish the direction of down since gravity is known to cause downward acceleration . In some embodiments external coordinate system can be established by reference to the orientation of magnetic field vector e.g. to establish a constant reference direction since the magnetic field will typically be appreciably constant over the area of a typical play area for an athletic activity . In some embodiments external coordinate system can be established by reference to the orientation of gravity vector and the orientation of magnetic field vector .

During motion individual and sensor module may move in any or all of six degrees of freedom three linear degrees 1 up down e.g. along the Y axis in external coordinate system 2 left right e.g. along the X axis in external coordinate system and 3 backward forward e.g. along the Z axis in external coordinate system and three rotational degrees 1 yaw e.g. in the angular direction in external coordinate system 2 roll e.g. in the angular direction in external coordinate system and 3 pitch e.g. in the angular direction in external coordinate system .

Individual or other person may desire to know activity metrics of individual for example to learn the effects of actions of individual . Monitoring system may determine such activity metrics e.g. identification of forces acting on or applied by individual identification of a motion made by individual determination of a jump characteristic of individual and determination of a reaction time of individual . Sensor module may output data representative of such activity metrics e.g. to a display device of personal computer or portable electronic device . Such data may be outputted from sensor module in raw form e.g. unprocessed signals from acceleration sensor and or magnetic field sensor or in representative form e.g. data that results from processing signals from acceleration sensor and or magnetic field sensor . In some embodiments monitoring system outputs a representation of one or more activity metrics in a manner perceivable by individual and or other person.

Data representative of such activity metrics can be processed and or output in any suitable manner such as for example those described herein.

In some embodiments for example as shown in an external coordinate system e.g. external coordinate system is determined at a first time see e.g. operation where sensor module is in a calibration state at the first time. In some embodiments the orientation of an internal coordinate system fixed with reference to sensor module e.g. internal coordinate system is determined relative to external coordinate system see e.g. operation . For ease of description internal coordinate system is described herein to align with external coordinate system at the first time but it should be understood that internal coordinate system need not align with external coordinate system e.g. internal coordinate system may be established by an angular offset from external coordinate system and that internal coordinate system need not be characterized by traditional coordinate components but may be characterized simply by some reference establishing the relative orientation of sensor module with respect to the external coordinate system e.g. external coordinate system . Components of internal coordinate system are designated in the figures as X e.g. left right Y e.g. up down Z e.g. backward forward e.g. yaw e.g. roll and e.g. pitch and changes in the coordinate components are designated as X Y Z and respectively see e.g. .

For example as depicted in in some embodiments acceleration sensor is used to determine the orientation of gravity vector with respect to sensor module i.e. with respect to internal coordinate system at the first time see e.g. operation and in some embodiments magnetic field sensor is used to determine the orientation of magnetic field vector with respect to sensor module at the first time see e.g. operation . In some embodiments the orientation of internal coordinate system with respect to external coordinate system can be determined based on one or both of gravity vector and magnetic field vector see e.g. operation . In this way an initial orientation of individual can be determined based on the initial orientation of sensor module including internal coordinate system within external coordinate system .

In some embodiments monitoring device determines and or outputs one or more sensed motion characteristics of individual see e.g. operation including for example position of individual or a portion thereof orientation of individual or a portion thereof orientation and or magnitude of speed of individual or a portion thereof orientation and or magnitude of acceleration of individual or a portion thereof orientation and or magnitude of forces applied to individual or a portion thereof duration of movement of individual or a portion thereof posture of individual or a portion thereof rotation of individual or a portion thereof and or a degree of correspondence to a movement data profile or changes therein.

In some embodiments for example see rotation e.g. three dimensional rotation of individual including for example rotation of individual as a whole or of one or more monitored portions of individual recognizing that portions of individual may move relative to each other can be determined between the first time and a second time see e.g. operation where individual is in motion at the second time. In some embodiments such rotation can be output by monitoring system and or used by monitoring system for further operations.

For example in some embodiments the change in orientation of individual between the first time and the second time is determined based on magnetic field data sensed by magnetic field sensor from the first time to the second time. For example the change in orientation of individual between the first time and the second time may be expressed by the angular difference of axes X Y and Z between the first time and the second time with respect to external coordinate system depicted as and .

In some embodiments for example see the change in position of individual between the first time and the second time is determined see e.g. operation based on acceleration data sensed by acceleration sensor from the first time to the second time. In some embodiments such change in position can be output by monitoring system and or used by monitoring system for further operations.

For example the change in position of individual between the first time and the second time may be expressed by the linear difference in position of sensor module along of axes X Y and Z between the first time and the second time with respect to external coordinate system depicted as X Y and Z .

As described individual s motion between two points in time can be characterized by change in position and change in orientation of sensor module between the two points in time. In some embodiments a more complete representation of individual s motion can be characterized by monitoring change in position and change in orientation of sensor module between multiple sequential points in time. In other words the technique described above for characterizing individual s motion between two points can be repeated from the second time to a third time. Change in position and change in orientation can be measured absolutely e.g. with continuing reference to the position and orientation of sensor module at the first time which may be a calibration state or relatively e.g. with reference to the immediately preceding position and orientation or any other sensed position and orientation . As will be appreciated the greater the rate of sampling of position and orientation the more complete the representation of individual s motion will Le. In some embodiments where change in position and change in orientation is measured relatively sensor module may not be calibrated with respect to an external coordinate system.

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine an indication of the posture of individual . In some embodiments such posture can be output by monitoring system and or used by monitoring system for further operations. Posture can be determined based on the orientation of a sensor module mounted to individual . For example a sensor module can be mounted on the trunk of individual in a predetermined or otherwise calibrated orientation with reference to individual such that monitoring system can determine the posture of individual based on the orientation of sensor module determined as described above . For example sensor module may be mounted on individual such that a reference coordinate direction coincides with the direction of a gravity vector or magnetic field vector when individual s trunk is perpendicular to the ground. In some embodiments if monitoring system detects that the reference coordinate direction coincides with the gravity vector or magnetic field vector monitoring system may determine that individual is in a standing position. In some embodiments if monitoring system detects that the reference coordinate direction is orthogonal to the gravity vector or magnetic field vector monitoring system may determine that individual is in a prone or supine position. In some embodiments multiple sensor modules can operate similarly mounted to an individual to determine sub postures of different portions of individual and more complex overall postures of individual may be determined based on comparisons of the determined sub postures to each other or to data defining reference postures.

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine an indication of orientation and or magnitude of acceleration of individual together an acceleration vector and change therein. In some embodiments such indication of orientation and or magnitude of acceleration of individual or change therein can be output by monitoring system and or used by monitoring system for further operations. Magnitude and direction of acceleration can be sensed directly by sensor module with reference to internal coordinate system . Monitoring system can determine change in magnitude and direction of acceleration based on this sensed data see e.g. operation . Change in magnitude of acceleration from a first time to a second time can be determined by calculating the difference between the magnitude of acceleration sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module at the first time and the magnitude of acceleration sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module at the second time. Change in direction of acceleration from a first time to a second time can be determined by calculating the difference between the angle of an acceleration vector see e.g. sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module at the first time and the angle of acceleration vector sensed by acceleration sensor of sensor module at the second time. Such change in direction of acceleration can be correlated to the corresponding orientation of individual by reference to the orientation of sensor modulo determined based on magnetic field data sensed by sensor module as described above. Thus as described change in orientation position magnitude of acceleration and direction of acceleration can be determined to characterize the motion of individual for a series of points in time.

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine an indication of orientation and or magnitude of forces applied to or by individual and change therein. In some embodiments such indication of orientation and or magnitude of forces applied to individual or change therein can be output by monitoring system and or used by monitoring system for further operations. In some embodiments monitoring system can sense acceleration of individual via acceleration sensor of sensor module e.g. as described above . In some embodiments monitoring system may receive data representative of a mass of individual which in some embodiments can be input into monitoring system for example using an interface thereof e.g. an input of personal computer or portable electronic device such as for example a keyboard microphone or touchscreen . In some embodiments in the event that a sensor mounted on individual is mounted on a portion of individual with a separately identifiable mass e.g. an arm of individual the mass of individual can be input for that sensor as the mass of the monitored arm of individual . In some embodiments mass of individual can be defined as a default value which can be overridden in the event a mass of individual is input. In some embodiments monitoring system can determine force for a given acceleration e.g. determined as described above of individual based on the determined acceleration and the mass of individual e.g. by multiplying mass and acceleration . Force can be determined in any direction since acceleration can be sensed in any desired direction. For example lateral side to side vertical up down and or longitudinal front back forces applied to or by individual can be determined as can combinations thereof based on components of acceleration data sensed in the desired direction. Lateral forces may dominate i.e. be the strongest component force when for example individual cuts left or cuts right. Vertical forces may dominate when for example individual jumps or drops toward the ground. Longitudinal forces may dominate when for example individual stops or begins running.

Movement of individual may be represented by one or more sensed motion characteristics including for example position of individual or a portion thereof orientation of individual or a portion thereof orientation and or magnitude of speed of individual or a portion thereof orientation and or magnitude of acceleration of individual or a portion thereof orientation and or magnitude of forces applied to individual or a portion thereof duration of movement of individual or a portion thereof posture of individual or a portion thereof and or rotation of individual or a portion thereof or changes therein. Individual may perform any movement such as for example a jump a backflip a cut right a cut left a slide a reverse of direction a barrel roll a kick or a swing.

In some embodiments monitoring system may identify a movement of individual based on one or more of the sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data which may be associated with the time at which the data was sensed of individual in performing the movement. For example if individual performs a backflip monitoring system may identify that individual has performed a backflip. Any movement of individual may be monitored and identified including for example a throw of an object a kick of an object a jump a jump shot a layup a slide a left turn a right turn a reverse in direction a change in position a sprint a pose a dive .

In some embodiments movement data profiles i.e. one or more of sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data that define a movement for one or more movements may be stored within or otherwise accessible by monitoring system such that monitoring system can compare sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data with the movement data profiles.

In some embodiments monitoring system may compare sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data of individual with one or more movement data profiles see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system may perform such comparison continuously.

In some embodiments upon determining a sufficient degree of correspondence between the sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data and a movement data profile or portion thereof see e.g. operation monitoring system identifies the motion corresponding to that movement data profile as the movement performed by individual see e.g. operation . In some embodiments a sufficient degree of correspondence is determined where the difference between the sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data and the movement data profile is less than a predetermined threshold the threshold may be different for different movement data profiles .

In some embodiments the identified motion can be stored by monitoring system as described herein e.g. in memory of sensor module of in a memory of server personal computer or portable electronic device In some embodiments characteristics of the identified motion are determined and stored in association with the identified motion e.g. acceleration speed distance moved duration of movement or forces acting on or applied by individual during the identified motion .

In some embodiments the identified motion is output in a manner perceivable by individual or other person e.g. via a visual display or audio speaker of or in communication with sensor module portable electronic device or personal computer see e.g. operation . In some embodiments the identified motion is output in conjunction with characteristics of the identified motion in a manner perceivable by individual or other person e.g. via a visual display or audio speaker of or in communication with sensor module portable electronic device or personal computer .

In some embodiments movement data profiles can include expressions of acceleration data and magnetic field data and variables derived therefrom e.g. force acceleration magnitude acceleration orientation magnetic field magnitude magnetic field orientation and can be expressed and or stored as data structures within monitoring system for example as an algorithm as a graphical curve or as a lookup table.

In some embodiments monitoring system may determine a reaction time of individual . In some embodiments an instruction is communicated to individual to perform a particular instructed movement e.g. complete a backflip reach a maximum or target acceleration reach an optimal or target trunk position . In some embodiments the instruction may be transmitted to and received by sensor module e.g. from an external device such as for example portable electronic device and output from sensor module in a manner perceivable by individual e.g. via a speaker or display of or in communication with sensor module see e.g. operation . In some embodiments the instruction may be communicated to individual without being passed through sensor module . For example an external device such as for example portable electronic device may output the instruction in a manner perceivable by individual e.g. via a speaker or display of or in communication with electronic device . In some embodiments the instruction may be communicated to individual by another person e.g. by a person operating an external device such as for example portable electronic device yelling the instruction to individual at an appropriate time where the person may be prompted to do so by the external device .

In some embodiments monitoring system determines the reaction time of individual to be the time between an instruction being sent or received as described above and the time individual begins or completes the instructed movement . In some embodiments acceleration data and magnetic field data of individual are determined after an instruction is sent or received see e.g. operation to identify a movement performed by individual see e.g. operation . In some embodiments acceleration data and magnetic field data derived from individual are compared to a movement data profile of the instructed movement see e.g. operation . In some embodiments if the movement performed by individual corresponds to a movement data profile of the instructed movement see e.g. operation monitoring system calculates the reaction time of individual as the elapsed time between sending or receiving the instruction and beginning or completing the instructed movement see e.g. operation . In some embodiments a degree of correspondence may be determined by monitoring system for a monitored movement of individual where the degree of correspondence provides an indication of how closely the movement of individual corresponded to a movement data profile. Such a degree of correspondence can be based on the magnitude of the difference between the sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data and the movement data profile.

In some embodiments monitoring system can compare such a degree of correspondence with a target degree of correspondence or range thereof and if the movement of individual does not reach the target or is outside the range monitoring system may instruct individual to repeat the movement or may provide an indication that the individual s attempt to perform the instructed movement was not successful. In some embodiments monitoring system may provide feedback e.g. via an audio speaker visual display or haptic output to help guide individual through performance of the instructed movement in order to help individual improve performance of the movement and achieve a greater degree of correspondence with the instructed movement. For example monitoring system may provide output alerting individual of deficiencies in individual s movement e.g. by identifying portions of individual s movement where data representing individual s movement deviates most significantly from the movement data profile for the instructed movement .

In some embodiments monitoring system may define a movement data profile for an instructed movement. In some embodiments an instruction is communicated to individual to perform a particular instructed movement as described above see e.g. operation . In some embodiments acceleration data and magnetic field data of individual are determined after an instruction is sent or received see e.g. operation . In some embodiments the sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data are used to define a movement data profile for the instructed movement see e.g. operation . Such a movement data profile can be stored and used for example in subsequent identification of a movement of individual or of reaction time of individual as described herein. In some embodiments monitoring system identifies the beginning and end of the movement of individual automatically e.g. the beginning of the movement may be identified upon sensed acceleration data crossing above a threshold value remaining above a threshold value for a predetermined period of time or upon acceleration data and magnetic field data of individual corresponding to a predetermined pattern and the end of the movement may be identified upon sensed acceleration data crossing below a threshold value remaining below a threshold value for a predetermined period of time or upon acceleration data and magnetic field data of individual corresponding to a predetermined pattern .

Defining a movement data profile is described above in terms of an instructed movement for clarity but is not limited to instructed movements. In some embodiments individual may select or input an identifier e.g. a label such as for example a text string a number an image for a movement to define e.g. using an interface including one or more movement identifiers to select from or an input to input a movement identifier where the interface or input may be a part of or in communication with sensor module for example an interface of sensor module personal computer or portable electronic device .

In some embodiments acceleration data derived from motion of individual can be used to determine a jump characteristic of individual . For example in some embodiments acceleration data derived from motion of individual can be used to determine a jump height characteristic e.g. the maximum height of a jump of individual . Also for example in some embodiments acceleration data derived from motion of individual can be used to determine a jump force characteristic e.g. the force applied during a jump of individual .

In some embodiments monitoring system determines that individual has performed a jump see e.g. operation . In some embodiments acceleration sensor is an inertial system and thus does not sense acceleration due to gravity in free flight. Also in free flight movement of individual typically will not cause significant acceleration. In some embodiments monitoring system determines that individual has performed a jump by sensing a resultant acceleration of about zero e.g. acceleration over a period of at least 100 ms characterized by a mean resultant acceleration of less than 15 of 1 G i.e. acceleration due to gravity .

In some embodiments once it has been determined that a jump has been performed monitoring system analyzes sensed acceleration data derived from motion of individual from before the jump was detected to determine a time of initiation of the jump when the motion leading to take off was initiated for example after bending the legs the moment the legs begin to extend to propel individual from the ground see e.g. operation and a time of take off of the jump when individual left the ground see e.g. operation . In some embodiments this acceleration data derived from motion of individual is analyzed based on data stored in a buffer of sensor module as described herein.

In some embodiments the time of initiation of the jump is determined to be a time during a period immediately preceding takeoff at which resultant acceleration sensed by sensor module is at a minimum for the period. In some embodiments the period may be for example about 50 ms. In some embodiments vertical velocity of sensor module is determined to be zero at the time of initiation of the jump.

In some embodiments the time of take off of the jump is determined to be the time at which resultant acceleration sensed by the sensor module reaches about zero. In some embodiments vertical acceleration of sensor module is sensed between initiation of the jump and take off of the jump. In some embodiments monitoring system determines vertical velocity of sensor module at take off see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system determines vertical velocity of sensor module at take off based on the vertical velocity of sensor module and the acceleration data sensed between initiation of the jump and take off of the jump. In some embodiments monitoring system determines vertical velocity of sensor module at take off based on the vertical velocity of sensor module and the acceleration data sensed between initiation of the jump and take off of the jump by a calculation using the following formula V V adt.

In some embodiments monitoring system determines a jump characteristic of individual based on the vertical velocity at take off see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system determines a maximum jump height of the jump of individual based on the vertical velocity at take off and conservation of energy principles. In some embodiments monitoring system determines a maximum jump height of the jump of individual by a conservation of energy calculation based on the vertical velocity at take off for example using the formula MV MgH H V 2 g where M is mass of individual and cancels out H is maximum jump height g is acceleration due to gravity and Vis vertical velocity at take off.

In some embodiments monitoring system determines a jump characteristic of individual based on acceleration data sensed during the jump. In some embodiments monitoring system senses acceleration data over one or more periods of time during the jump see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system receives data representative of the mass of individual which can be input directly into monitoring system by individual e.g. via an interface thereof or which can be approximated based on a preset default value see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system integrates the acceleration over one or more periods of time during the jump see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system multiplies the result of the integration by the mass of individual see e.g. operation . In some embodiments monitoring system determines jump force of the jump of individual based on the integration of the acceleration multiplied by the mass of individual see e.g. operation . Jump force of individual can change throughout a jump. In some embodiments monitoring system determines jump force as described above for a plurality of periods throughout the jump. In some embodiments monitoring system determines all of a subset of determined forces throughout the jump as a jump force profile. In some embodiments monitoring system determines the maximum or minimum jump force throughout the jump.

Monitoring system can output representations of activity metrics of individual including for example forces acting on or applied by individual a motion made by individual a jump characteristic of individual and a reaction time of individual in a manner perceivable by individual or other person e.g. a coach trainer or spectator . Data generated within or received by any component of monitoring system can be transmitted processed and output in any suitable manner including those described herein.

For example in some embodiments representations of activity metrics can be output e.g. via a visual display an audio speaker or a haptic output to a portable electronic device e.g. portable electronic device or personal computer e.g. personal computer . In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and output for example representations of activity metrics in real time representations of past activity metrics representations of predicted activity metrics representations of comparisons of a current or most recent value for an activity metric to a past value for that activity metric representations of comparisons of one activity metric to a different activity metric representations of comparisons of a value for an activity metric to a target value for the activity metric representations of comparisons of a value for an activity metric for an individual to a value for the same or a different activity metric for a different individual.

In some embodiments representations of activity metrics can be presented as functions of one another or of other variables. For example jump height can be presented as a function of trunk orientation or of launch angle of a ball. Also for example activity metrics can be presented as a function of location e.g. location on a playing field proximity to a player proximity to a goal as a function of an event e.g. scoring of a field goal committing a foul as a function of an environmental condition e.g. ambient temperature precipitation or as a function of a physiological condition of an individual e.g. heart rate body temperature . Information relating to such variables e.g. location information event information environmental condition information and physiological condition information may be provided to monitoring system from appropriate sensors incorporated therein or from elements outside of monitoring system that are in communication with monitoring system .

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine and output such representations in any perceivable way for example numerically e.g. by outputting a value indicative of the activity metric or comparison textually e.g. by outputting a word or phrase indicative of the activity metric or comparison graphically e.g. by outputting a graph or other image indicative of the activity metric or comparison or tabularly e.g. by outputting a table indicative of the activity metric or comparison .

In some exemplary embodiments identified movements of individual are depicted in a display such as for example output display which in some embodiments may be a display of any element described herein such as for example sensor module portable electronic device personal computer group monitoring device see e.g. . In some embodiments display may be a display screen of a portable electronic device e.g. portable electronic device or personal computer e.g. personal computer or may be a printed page. In some embodiments display may display a representation of each movement of individual identified by monitoring system for a period e.g. during an athletic activity during a defined period of time for the lifetime of monitoring system see e.g. .

In some embodiments display may display an indication of intensity of the identified movements. For example an indication of the acceleration speed distance moved duration of movement or force of an identified motion may be displayed. Such indication of intensity may represent the intensity of a single motion or may represent the intensity of multiple instances of motions identified as the same type e.g. an average or maximum intensity .

In some embodiments an indication of overall performance of individual can be determined and displayed based on sensed acceleration data and magnetic field data. In some embodiments indication of overall performance of individual can be determined based on characteristics of one or more identified motions of individual e.g. number of instances of a type of motion duration of motion or of a type of motion intensity of motion or of a type of motion . In some embodiments indication of overall performance can be represented numerically see e.g. . In some embodiments indication of overall performance can be represented graphically see e.g. graph in 

In some embodiments monitoring system may determine and display may display any of the representations described herein for a single individual or for multiple different individuals . In some embodiments display may display any of the representations described herein comparatively for two or more individuals. For example in some embodiments display may display a comparative bar chart showing the intensity of one or more types of movement of one individual in juxtaposition with the intensity of one or more types of movement of a different individual . Also for example in some embodiments display may display an overall performance comparison juxtaposing indication of overall performance for one individual with indication of overall performance for a different individual .

In some embodiments monitoring system may determine and display may display a graphical timeline of identified movements performed by individual see e.g. . In some embodiments graphical timeline may include indications of each identified movement presented according to the time at which the movement occurred. In some embodiments indications that correspond to identified movements having a characteristic exceeding a threshold may be represented as distinct indications which may appear visually different from other indications . For example distinct indications may be larger than other indications may be differently colored than other indications or may be marked with a graphic such as for example a star.

In some embodiments monitoring system may determine and display may display a graph e.g. star plot depicting types and intensities of identified motions of individual see e.g. . In some embodiments star plot may include a representation of types and intensities of identified motions of individual overlaid on a second representation of types and intensities of motions. In some embodiments second representation may represent averages of types and intensities of motions of a group of individuals. In some embodiments second representation may represent averages of types and intensities of motions of individual over a different time period than that represented by representation . In some embodiments second representation may represent types and intensities of motions of a different individual than individual .

In some embodiments activity metrics can be output in a game like manner. Points or other positive or negative feedback may be determined and output based on values for activity metrics for individual . Comparisons based on such values or feedback can influence progress in the game. For example such values or feedback may be compared to past values or feedback for the same individual and improvement may result in positive progress being made in the game e.g. a higher level being designated to a game account of individual . Also for example such values or feedback may be compared to values or feedback of a different individual including data of or purported to be of a professional athlete or other well known individual and progress in the game may be determined based on that comparison. Also for example such values or feedback may be compared to target values or feedback and progress in the game may be determined based on that comparison. Also for example in some embodiments such activity metrics can govern capabilities of a virtual player in a virtual game by being uploaded to or otherwise accessed by the game e.g. the maximum jump height of an individual may limit the maximum jump height of a virtual avatar of the individual in a virtual game .

In some embodiments monitoring system can be used as a standalone monitoring system. In some embodiments however monitoring system or components thereof can be used in conjunction with or incorporated into other monitoring systems including for example those disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 077 494 filed Mar. 31 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

For example in some embodiments any of the characteristics including values and or outputs described herein can be used and or output in conjunction with characteristics from other monitoring systems for example monitoring devices and associated components that sense characteristics e.g. movement performance and or physiological characteristics of one or more objects or players engaged in an athletic activity such as described above for example with respect to the group monitoring system . For example an individual engaged in an athletic activity may be separately monitored by a different monitoring device e.g. a monitoring device including a heart rate monitor a global positioning signal receiver a temperature sensor a wind sensor a moisture sensor or motion of an object e.g. a ball used in such activity may be monitored such that additional characteristics of the individual s performance or object s motion can be monitored and or output for observation by for example a coach trainer or spectator or for later review by the individual himself Simultaneously characteristics of individual may be monitored and or output as described herein with reference to monitoring system . The characteristics resulting from monitoring of individual can be used together with the characteristics resulting from other monitoring devices monitoring individual and or an object. For example characteristics derived by monitoring individual as described herein with reference to monitoring system can be displayed in a time correlated manner with characteristics derived from other monitoring devices. Also for example characteristics derived by monitoring individual as described herein with reference to monitoring system can be expressed as a function of characteristics derived from other monitoring devices or vice versa . Also for example new characteristics can be determined based on analysis of both characteristics derived by monitoring individual as described herein with reference to monitoring system and characteristics derived from other monitoring devices e.g. the time it takes for the individual to react to an instruction to kick a monitored ball .

For example jump height of individual may be monitored during performance of an athletic activity and trajectory of a monitored ball may also be monitored during performance of the athletic activity. A monitoring system taking both of these characteristics into account may display or otherwise output jump height of individual in conjunction with a characteristic of a sports object such as for example the launch angle of the ball after each jump which for example may help individual evaluate characteristics of his jump shot see e.g. . For a series of jumps maximum jump height of individual may be expressed as a function of trajectory of the ball. Similar comparison combinations and or representations can be provided for any other combination of characteristics derived by monitoring individual as described herein with reference to monitoring system and characteristics derived from other monitoring devices.

In some embodiments monitoring system can provide real time feedback to individual . Such real time feedback can be provided during any activity of individual for example during a training exercise. In some embodiments monitoring system may monitor individual via sensor module while individual performs a movement see e.g. operation . Individual may perform the movement repeatedly with the goal of improving some aspect of his performance of the movement e.g. increasing his jump height decreasing his reaction time or more accurately performing the movement . It is believed that the provision of timely concise periodic feedback about an aspect of a movement that an individual is working to improve helps the individual to more efficiently improve that aspect of movement. In some embodiments sensor module coupled to individual while individual is performing such movements transmits data relating to an aspect of the movement e.g. a selected aspect the individual is working to improve to a remote device e.g. portable electronic device see e.g. operation . The remote device may receive the data see e.g. operation and display a representation of the data e.g. via a display screen audio speaker or haptic output of or in communication with the remote device to individual during or immediately following each repetition of the movement see e.g. operation . The representation may be for example an expression of a value related to the movement e.g. jump height may be represented by the number of vertical inches jumped see e.g. and or an expression of a comparison of a value related to the movement to a previous or target value related to the movement e.g. a jump height of 20 inches where a previous jump height was 19 inches may be displayed with a positive signal such as a green background or a plus sign to show improvement while a jump height of 18 inches where a previous jump height was 19 inches may be displayed with a negative signal such as a red background or a minus sign to show decrease in performance see e.g. . Data from repeated movements can be stored for later display and analysis e.g. display of a graph showing a representation of each movement for example as shown in .

For example in some embodiments monitoring system can determine jump height of a jump of individual as described above and can output e.g. automatically a representation of the jump height of the jump to a remote device being viewed by individual e.g. portable electronic device . To facilitate viewing by individual the remote device may be located such that its output is perceivable by individual during performance of the movement and the representation may occupy substantially all of a display of the remote device. In this way individual receives immediate feedback as to the height of the jump. Monitoring system can then determine jump height of any number of jumps of individual and can similarly output representations of the jump height of each jump. Such operations can be repeated as desired. Real time knowledge of individual s jump height can help individual understand the progress individual is making in improving his jump height for example by allowing individual to make adjustments to his movement form and immediately determine the effects of such adjustments. Having such knowledge is believed to drive more rapid improvement than would be achieved without having such knowledge.

For example in some embodiments monitoring system can determine activity metrics of the movement of individual determined as described herein including for example reaction time acceleration applied forces extent of movement and change in position and can output e.g. automatically a representation of such activity metrics of a first movement to a remote device being viewed by individual e.g. portable electronic device . In this way individual receives immediate feedback as to the activity metric s of the first movement. The instruction to perform an action e.g. triggering the beginning of the timed period for determining reaction time can be provided to individual via the remote device being viewed by individual . For example the instruction may be provided via an audio or visual output from the remote device. In some embodiments monitoring system can be configured to instruct a single movement repeatedly. In some embodiments monitoring system can be configured to instruct one of a set of movements e.g. a movement can be selected at random from a database of movement data profiles . In some embodiments the timing of the instruction output may vary e.g. be randomized within a given range in some embodiments a countdown may be displayed to help prepare individual for an impending instruction and in some embodiments initiation of such timing and or count down may depend on a determination by monitoring system that individual is stationary. The instruction can be for example a word describing the instructed movement e.g. jump dive cut left backflip or simply an output indicating the time to begin an instructed movement where the instructed movement is known e.g. where monitoring system is configured to instruct a single movement repeatedly . In some embodiments the instruction is provided by a change in a color or symbol displayed by the remote device e.g. a display of remote device may change from red to green indicating that individual should perform a jump one side of a display device may turn a particular color indicating that individual should perform a lunge toward that side or an arrow may be displayed pointing in a particular direction for example down indicating that individual should perform a corresponding movement for example drop to a prone position . In some embodiments after outputting the instruction monitoring system can determine activity metrics of the movement of individual determined as described herein including for example reaction time acceleration applied forces extent of movement change in position degree of correspondence to an instructed movement and can output a representation of the reaction time. Monitoring system can determine reaction time of any number of repeated reactions of individual and similarly output a representation of the reaction time of each reaction. Such operations can be repeated as desired. Real time knowledge of individual s reaction time can help individual understand the progress individual is making in improving his reaction time for example by allowing individual to make adjustments to his movement form and immediately determine the effects of such adjustments. Having such knowledge is believed to help an individual achieve more rapid improvement than would be achieved without having such knowledge.

In some embodiments monitoring system can determine a degree of correspondence of a movement of individual and may provide an indication e.g. via an audio speaker visual display or haptic output of for example portable electronic device and or group monitoring device of such degree of correspondence to individual immediately following performance of the movement. In some embodiments monitoring system can compare such degree of correspondence with a target degree of correspondence or range thereof. If the movement of individual does not reach the target or is outside the range monitoring system may immediately instruct individual to repeat the movement or may provide an indication that individual s attempt to perform the instructed movement was not successful. In some embodiments monitoring system may provide feedback e.g. via an audio speaker visual display or haptic output to help guide individual through performance of the instructed movement in order to help individual improve performance of the movement and achieve a greater degree of correspondence with the instructed movement. For example monitoring system may provide output alerting individual of deficiencies in individual s movement e.g. by identifying portions of individual s movement where data representing individual s movement deviates most significantly from the movement data profile for the instructed movement .

In some embodiments a plurality of individuals may be monitored. For example a plurality of individuals may be monitored via a plurality of sensor modules by a plurality of monitoring systems or a plurality of individuals may be monitored via a plurality of sensor modules by the same monitoring system . Such individuals may be monitored in any manner desired for example simultaneously at different times while participating in different athletic activities while participating in the same athletic activity. Activity metrics derived from each of the plurality of individuals and activity metrics can be similarly compared combined and or represented as described above. Such comparison combination and or representations can be made based on each individual considered separately see e.g. which shows two individuals separately compared on a subset of individuals grouped together e.g. a team midfielders of a team or on all monitored individuals. In a game setting such comparison combination and or representations can be correlated to game events such as a goal a ball traveling out of bounds a penalty kick or a jump ball which can be output in relation to contemporaneous activity metrics of individual s as described.

Such comparing combining and or representing data derived from monitoring individual s and or monitored objects can provide benefits to for example the individuals participating in an athletic activity coaches spectators physicians and game officials. Such persons may interact or work together during a session of athletic activity for a variety of reasons.

For example it may be desired that a coach monitors the performance of the monitored individual s and makes recommendations or otherwise influences their performance in order to maximize fitness level of individual s . Alternatively or additionally it may be desired that the coach monitors and influences individual s to help maximize the effectiveness of individual s in the athletic activity. Further it may be desired that the coach monitors and influences individual s to help maximize the probability of success in the athletic activity where success may be for example defeating an opposing team in a game such as for example soccer or achieving maintaining a desired level of fitness for one or more individual s participating in the athletic activity . A session of athletic activity may include for example a training session e.g. a field session a gym session a track session or a competitive session e.g. a soccer match or a basketball game .

In some exemplary embodiments the coach may monitor one or more individual s and or monitored objects and may provide feedback to individual s in order to track and maintain or improve the health safety and or performance of individual s .

The coach must consider these and other goals monitor the activity of individual s and or monitored objects and make decisions to influence the performance of individual s both individually and as a group. In doing so the coach depends on information about individual s and their performance while participating in a session of athletic activity. A monitoring system e.g. monitoring system that provides data about individual s and or monitored objects interacted with by the individuals can provide the coach with easy to understand information about individuals participating in the athletic activity beyond that which can be directly observed thereby facilitating quick and effective decision making by the coach to maximize the probability of achieving success in the athletic activity.

As noted above a variety of information may be communicated between any of the elements of monitoring system including for example sensor module personal computer portable electronic device network and server . Such information may include for example activity metrics device settings including sensor module settings software and firmware.

Communication among the various elements of the present invention may occur after the athletic activity has been completed or in real time during the athletic activity. In addition the interaction between for example sensor module and personal computer and the interaction between for example the personal computer and the server may occur at different times.

In the case of a plurality of monitored individuals and or monitored objects in some embodiments sensor devices e.g. sensor module s associated with each monitored individual and or object may each transmit data to a different associated remote device e.g. personal computer and or portable electronic device . In some embodiments multiple sensor devices e.g. sensor module s associated with monitored individual s and or objects may transmit data to the same associated remote device. In some embodiments multiple sensor devices e.g. sensor module s associated with monitored individual s and or objects may transmit data to an intermediate device e.g. a computer acting as a base station to receive data locally and transmit such data to one or more external devices with or without processing such data for example as described herein for re transmission to remote devices e.g. via network and or server . Such data transmission as described can occur in substantially real time e.g. during an athletic activity for real time analysis or can occur after completion of the athletic activity e.g. for post game analysis . Data transmitted can be in any form ranging from raw data sensed by sensors e.g. acceleration sensor and magnetic field sensor of sensor module or data resulting from any processing operation e.g. such identifying determining calculating or storing as described herein . Any processing of the data as described herein can take place at any device that receives data transmission as described.
