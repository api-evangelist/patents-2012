In one embodiment including a progressive gaming scheme the accounting system includes a machine paid progressive meter and an attendant paid progressive meter. The machine paid progressive meter monitors the progressive win values paid out for a progressive game. Additionally the attendant paid progressive meter monitors and counts the value of all winnings from a particular progressive game paid out.

In one embodiment there are a set of meters in the GMU that serve a function similar to those in the gaming machine. The GMU meter is typically meter data not directly available from the game. Meters from the game are commonly called hard meters while the GMU meters are usually referred to as soft meters. In one embodiment meters maintain accounting information game play or other systems events. In one embodiment meters are maintained in a special area of memory that is non volatile. This is done so that in the case of unexpected power failure the current meter values will not be lost. Player terminals meters are maintained by each player terminal and keep track of ticket transaction summaries game play summaries cash transaction summaries and other essential accounting information.

As shown in in one embodiment one or more gaming machines include an External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter . More particularly when the casino gaming system generates a jackpot and awards the jackpot to a player at a gaming machine the amount of the winning jackpot is recorded on the External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter . Otherwise stated the system based jackpot is awarded to a player at a gaming machine and the amount of the winning jackpot is recorded on a gaming machine based meter. The player may be randomly determined. Additionally the trigger for awarding the jackpot may be randomly determined based on predetermined criteria set by the casino or gaming system manufacturer. Once the jackpot win occurs the player at the selected gaming machine is notified usually by a visible sign or message. In one embodiment the amount of the jackpot win or bonus win is recorded on the External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter .

Referring now to a casino gaming system is illustrated. The casino gaming system includes multiple gaming machines connected via a network to a back end system . In one embodiment a router connects the gaming machines to the back end system . In one particular embodiment the router is a GameNet router that routes information from the GMU in each gaming machine to a Game Net Server which is part of the back end system . In one such embodiment the back end system also includes the iSERIES server i.e. IBM iSERIES server which includes a slot accounting system a slot marketing system and a casino management and accounting system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other components may be included in the back end system .

In one embodiment the casino gaming system includes a system generated jackpot awarded to players on the casino floor. The jackpot may be a time and value based award that is funded by marketing dollars and is paid to the winning player who has a player tracking card inserted into a gaming machine at the time the winning value is selected. In one embodiment the award is available to all players based on the grouping of the specific settings which may include all gaming machine on the casino floor. Alternately the casino may restrict the grouping to a specific number of gaming machines by gaming machine denomination s and or by gaming machine manufacturer s and or by gaming machine zone s or a set of specific asset gaming machine numbers. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the jackpot award may be funded by a means other than marketing dollars.

In one embodiment the casino operator determines the criteria for triggering the jackpot award. For example in one embodiment the casino operator enters an average jackpot win amount an average award time and an average reset time. The actual award grows from the reset value towards the desired value. The progressive growth is not linked to a wagering activity on the casino floor. At a random time during the progressive growth the award is triggered. At the award time the actual value is stopped from growing and further and is randomly awarded out the floor.

In general once a jackpot win occurs the back end system delivers a message to the gaming machine regarding the awarded jackpot win. In one embodiment the value of a system generated jackpot is recorded on a game External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter . Additionally in an optional embodiment the casino gaming system may also award consolation prizes to those players who do not win the jackpot. In this embodiment the back end system sends consolation information to the qualifying gaming machines. The value of the consolation prizes may be recorded on the game External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter . Further in an alternate embodiment the back end system can send instructions to lock up a gaming machine upon the occurrence of a system generated jackpot win.

More particularly upon the occurrence of jackpot win the back end system sends information to a controller located on a gaming machine . The controller causes an External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter at the gaming machine to keep track of winning jackpots generated by the back end system and award at the gaming machine .

In one embodiment a controller located on the gaming machine receives a message from the back end system regarding a system generated winning jackpot. More particularly in one embodiment the controller is a NT controller board that is modified to accept transactions from the back end system . Optionally in an alternate embodiment the NT controller board is modified to accept transactions from the iSERIES server which is a back end system main frame.

In one example a transaction received from the back end system includes information containing the value of the winning jackpot amount. After receiving the information containing the jackpot win amount from the back end system the NT controller board will transfer the jackpot winnings to the game. More particularly in one example embodiment the NT controller board will use the SAS AFT Long Poll command 0x72 with a transfer type code e.g. to transfer bonus jackpot win amount from host to gaming machine and force attendant pay lockup to transfer the cashable winnings to the game. This will cause the gaming machine to lock itself up into a hand pay condition for the amount of the jackpot and will require an employee to perform a jackpot reset on the gaming machine. Once the attendant resets the game the game s External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter will increment for the amount of the jackpot and send a message to the NT controller board detailing the amount of the meter incrementation. This information is then passed on to the back end system by the NT controller board.

Additionally the NT controller board may also accept a transaction from the back end system including information containing the value of a consolation prize. More particularly in one embodiment after the system generates and awards a jackpot the system may also award consolation prizes to one or more players. Typically the consolation prizes are given to players who meet certain criteria. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the criteria may be configured by the manufacturer and or the casino. For example in one embodiment a player is eligible for a consolation prize if he has a player card inserted in a qualified gaming machine and game play is activated on the qualified gaming machine at the time of the jackpot occurrence. The back end system identifies the casino players who qualify for a consolation prize and transfer a consolation prize amount to a consolation account which is accessible to each qualifying player via a user interface. In one embodiment each qualifying player may access the account via the iView. Alternately the qualifying player may access the consolation account via a standard keyboard.

Once a qualifying player is identified the back end server system sends a message to each gaming machine having an inserted player tracking card. More particularly the back end system sends a message to the NT controller board on the gaming machine wherein the message includes information regarding the consolation prize amount along with instructions for the NT controller board to transfer cashable winnings to the game. In one example embodiment the NT Controller Board uses the SAS AFT Long Poll command 0x72 with a transfer type code transfer bonus coin out win amount from host to gaming machine to transfer the Cashable winnings to the game. Upon receiving the instructions the game will add the amount of the consolation prize to an External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter . Once the credits are applied to the game the game s External Machine Paid Bonus Win meter will increment for that amount. Further once the game increments the External Machine Paid Bonus Win meter the NT controller board receives information from the game that the meter has been incremented. Additionally the NT controller board will in turn pass the meter incrementation information along to the back end system .

In an alternate embodiment the NT controller board may also validate a player s PIN. Optionally in another embodiment the validation process may be carried out via another component of the casino system.

In one embodiment the External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter tracks taxable events occurring at each gaming machine. The External Attendant Paid Bonus Win meter is incremented at the gaming machine and nothing is given to the players. Otherwise stated the system generates a jackpot award and sends a message which causes the meter at the gaming machine to be incremented for the amount of the award. This places the winnings into the gaming machines memory as required by certain jurisdictions. However the money is not usable on the gaming machine.

The following embodiment illustrates the task of applying a system generated jackpot win amount to a game in a casino gaming system. Initially an NT controller board code is modified to have a new compile option LEB that performs the following operations. First the existing asset specific 212 transaction is received from the system that contains the value of a server based jackpot e.g. a Power Winners jackpot . Second the NT controller board uses an SAS AFT command with the following parameters to apply the jackpot amount to the game as an External Attendant Paid Bonus Win. 

The game then locks itself up into a hand pay condition for the amount and needs an employee jackpot reset. Once this lock up occurs the External Attendant for the game and the system is dispatched. Paid Bonus Win meter records the amount. The NT control board then reports the result of the transfer to the system. There is no Slot Jackpot Transaction 30 Jackpot Request 32 or Jackpot Reset 40 Transaction associated with this process.

Regarding Gamenet tasks the Gamenet passes the new transaction to the iSERIES server. The iSERIES server then generates a report that justifies the power winner jackpot amount to the meter on the machine. Additionally information that is added to the end of the 212 Power Winner Transaction.

POS. 68 68 1 byte binary display type O ALL assets 1 Only Asset with card in 2 Assets without card in.

Alternatively another embodiment illustrates performing the task of applying a system generated consolation prize to a game in a casino gaming system. In this embodiment a game such as Power Winners is set up to award a consolation prize to all players that had their cards inserted into a gaming machine but did not win the big prize. Additionally the iSERIES server sets a new bit that instructs the NT controller to send an external bonus command to the machine.

As described above the iSERIES server has a report that justifies the power winner consolation amount transferred to the meter step on the machine. Additionally the iSERIES server has to deduct the win amount in the 257 to the consolation balance for the player. For example if the consolation prize was 50.00 and the player only withdraws 25.00. 25.00 should still be available in the player s account.

Regarding NT tasks if the compile option LEB is included in the build then the NT Controller Board code is modified to perform the following operations when activated in the 151 transaction 

 1 The existing asset specific 151 transaction is received from the system that contains the value of the Power Winner Consolation Prize.

 2 The player will access their money through the Power Rewards button on iVIEW or the PROMO button on the keypad.

 4 The NT Controller Board will use the SAS AFT Command with the following parameters to apply the consolation amount to the game as an External Machine Paid Bonus Win. 

The game adds the consolation prize to the credit meter. Once the consolation prize is added to the meter the External Machine Paid Bonus Win meter for the game and the system are incremented for the amount. The NT reports the result of the transfer to the system in a 257 transaction with New Type field.

One embodiment of the above described progressive game and method configured in accordance with the claimed invention is implemented over a gaming system on a system game user interface of a gaming machine. The gaming system includes one or more gaming machines that are connected to a system server preferably over a network. The system game user interface utilized by the time based progressive game and method provides enhanced player satisfaction and excitement through player competition or perceived competition and additional opportunities to win which results in increased user playing time on games in the system.

Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals denote like or corresponding components throughout the drawings and more particularly to A and B there is shown an embodiment of a progressive game implemented on a progressive processing system . Specifically shows a time based progressive game implemented on a progressive processing system that includes system gaming servers a slot management system a casino management system gaming machines a progressive engine 3and 4party business servers and 3and 4party devices and web sites . In one preferred embodiment the time based progressive game is a promotional game in that it is funded using non wagered dollars. The time based progressive game is preferably customizable enabling gaming parameters of the time based progressive game to be controlled by casino administrators that implement and manage the game.

Specifically a casino that employs a preferred embodiment of the progressive game is able to select the targeted progressive prize size and targeted progressive prize length of time until the award is given. This affords casino administrators a much greater and desirable amount of control in contrast to typical progressive games that are usually driven by components such as coin in to the gaming machines in the system which are not controlled by the casino. Furthermore in a preferred embodiment of a progressive game casino administrators are also able to customize the shape of the payout curve i.e. the curve of progressive prize size versus time at which the progressive prize is paid out . This as well is a highly desirable degree of control that is achievable in a preferred embodiment of a progressive game . This payout curve increases the desired excitement and anticipation of the players for the specific progressive game.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the casino administrators typically control 1 the targeted length of time at which each progressive prize is to be won 2 the targeted progressive prize value in dollars 3 the enticement factors if any that are used to help increase player excitement and or control of the payout curve and 4 the progressive prize reset value. Correspondingly in a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the progressive processing system typically controls the remaining factors of the progressive game including by way of example only and not by way of limitation 1 the targeted increment rate of the progressive prize which is calculated using the targeted progressive prize value the targeted progressive prize time and any added enticement factors 2 the random number generation algorithm used to determine if there will be a progressive prize winner and 3 if a progressive prize is to be awarded the random number generation algorithm used to determine who the award winner will be.

In another preferred embodiment of the progressive game the player selection may not use a random number generator at all. For instance by way of example only and not by way of limitation the slot management system SMS may pick the person with the longest current play session the person with the most money played the person who lost or won the most money in the last fifteen minutes the first person to insert a player card into a gaming device at the start of the last fifteen minute period or any other identifiable selection criteria.

The progressive game includes several desirable characteristics. For example in a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the player has the opportunity to win a progressive prize from the very beginning of the promotional progressive game cycle. Additionally in a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the progressive prize growth rate is not directly linked to the wagered coin in of floor play i.e. coin in from participating gaming machines does not directly contribute to the progressive prize growth . However the progressive prize can be indirectly or partially linked if desired with activity on the gaming floor using an enticement factor as described in further detail below. Such an enticement factor can create a casino moderated ebb and flow in response to gaming activity if the casino so desires.

In some preferred embodiments the progressive game uses one or more various enticement factors that speed up and or slow down the incremental growth rate of the targeted progressive prize. In one preferred embodiment one such enticement factor referred to herein as a floor activity enticement factor is based on gaming activity on the floor. In an additional preferred embodiment another such enticement factor referred to herein as an erratic movement enticement factor provides the addition of randomized movement to the incremental growth rate which gives the progressive increment rate a desirable look and feel i.e. makes the players feel like something is happening or that something is about to happen .

In yet an additional preferred embodiment another such enticement factor is based on the number of eligible players in the progressive gaming system e.g. the number of player card inserted in gaming machine and not the coin in amount. Various other types of enticement factors are customizable as desired to influence player behavior. For example in one preferred embodiment the display digits of the time based progressive game count faster from 1 to 3 then slower from 4 to 6 and finally at a medium count rate from 7 to 9.

With respect to another aspect of a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the winning player is selected randomly from among all active players at the time the progressive is awarded. In this regard an active player is defined as a player who has a player tracking card inserted into a gaming machine in the gaming system. In another preferred embodiment more than one player is randomly selected from among all active players at the time the progressive prize is awarded. In one such preferred embodiment the primary winning player receives X of the progressive prize and the rest of the winning players receive the remainder 100 X of the progressive prize.

In a preferred embodiment as shown in the progressive game is a system game that is displayed on a system game user interface such as an iVIEW type device described in further detail below . However in another preferred embodiment the progressive game may be implemented over another gaming platform. Preferably one embodiment of the progressive game is a time based and value based progressive game having a progressive prize that is funded from marketing dollars which is paid to one or more players who have a player tracking card inserted into the game when the award is activated. However in another preferred embodiment the time based progressive game may utilize other funding methods as indicated in A and B e.g. wagered dollars third party incentives third party services and the like .

In another aspect of a preferred embodiment the progressive game is self tunable to a desired casino profitability level by adjusting the targeted progressive prize amount to be awarded and the targeted time in which the progressive prize is to be awarded during the processing of the progressive prize information which takes into account the total money in and out of the entire business per unit time. In one preferred embodiment no player interaction is required with the progressive game in order to enhance the player s ability to win or enhance the amount of the player s win. However in another preferred embodiment the progressive game may utilize or allow at least some limited type of player interaction like a simulated game bingo. Moreover an alternative to dispensing cash to players at the gaming terminal is to dispense the prizes to player account buckets including bonus points eCash eGameCash and the like.

As stated above preferably all players that have their player cards inserted into an eligible gaming machine in the gaming system are eligible to win the progressive prize. Additionally the progressive prize that is available may be grouped in many different ways including by way of example only and not by way of limitation by game denomination by group of game machines on the floor i.e. grouped according to a distinguishable game machine characteristic or by random grouping of game machines on the floor. Alternatively the progressive prize available may be inclusive of all game machines on the floor. Otherwise stated in a preferred embodiment of the time based progressive game gaming machines on the floor are dynamically groupable by virtually any desired criteria. Moreover the progressive prize is preferably awarded to a randomly chosen player once the progressive prize requirement has been satisfied typically using a random number generator algorithm. Alternatively in another preferred embodiment the winner of the progressive prize is selected by type of players e.g. club level silver gold platinum and the like . Typically historical play data is typically used to calculate the players club level.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game a player inserts its player tracking card in an associated game machine . The player is then able to view specific progressive games prizes on the system game user interface that are eligible to the player. In one preferred embodiment the progressive values the progressive rules and any help information are all displayed to the player over the system game user interface from a gaming system server. Preferably the player is automatically eligible for a specific set of progressive games and does not need to interact with the system game user interface to enhance the player s opportunity to win one of the progressive games. Additionally in one preferred embodiment the player is able to select to play a specific progressive game from amongst a plurality of eligible progressive games. For example the number of choices may be limited to just one or two of a multitude. In another preferred embodiment the player may select to play a plurality of eligible progressive games simultaneously. Typically when a player removes its player tracking card from the progressive game the player becomes ineligible to win a progressive prize.

As stated above in a preferred embodiment of the progressive game to be eligible to win a specific progressive prize the player must have its player tracking card inserted in a game machine that is associated with the specific progressive prize at the time of progressive prize is given. For example in one specific non limiting example the casino may run three gaming promotions simultaneously one for nickel 0.05 denomination machines one for quarter 0.25 denomination machines and one for all machines on the floor. In such an embodiment a player that has its player tracking card inserted into a nickel machine is eligible to win both the nickel promotion and the floor wide promotion i.e. the player is able to select to play a plurality of eligible progressive games simultaneously . The progressive game need only know which player tracking cards are inserted at which game machines as well as details of the base game e.g. game denomination in order to be able to award progressive game winnings to the player.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game when determining what progressive prizes to make available casino personnel have to ability to control 1 the types of progressives games awards to make available 2 the progressive details e.g. progressive prize value and time to progressive prize payout of progressive games awards made available and 3 how the progressive funds are distributed to a player that wins a progressive prize.

With respect to the types of progressives the progressive game enables casino personnel with the ability to provide different progressives for different players by utilizing grouping criteria that includes by way of example only and not by way of limitation game denomination grouping of gaming machines by physical location on the gaming floor grouping of all gaming machines on the gaming floor player tracking card player level e.g. silver gold platinum and combinations thereof. Additionally rated theoretical wins or losses for a player or group of players could also be used in the player selection criteria.

As discussed above in one preferred embodiment the targeted progressive value is modified by a yield analysis to correlate with the desired casino profitability. For example if a casino had low earnings last week and the casino ran a 10 000 progressive game then the casino may only want to give a 5000 progressive game this week. In another preferred embodiment the progressive processing system is modified dynamically prior to the next weekly recurring progressive game. This automatic tuning of the desired casino profitability may involve altering the progressive prize size and or progressive prize time thereby tuning to the current business needs. In some preferred embodiments this tuning takes place while the progressive game is live i.e. in progress .

With respect to the progressive details of progressive games awards made available the progressive game enables casino personnel to determine the targeted time at which a progressive prize is given and the targeted dollars amount that will be distributed at that time. As previously stated in one preferred embodiment these targeted values are theoretical average values. The actual progressive prize time and progressive prize dollar amount will vary. As such players and potential players will not be able to guess the exact time or amount of the progressive prize and use this information to camp out when the progressive prize is imminent.

The following is a non limiting example of a progressive promotional award customized by a casino using the time based progressive game . A casino desires a daily progressive that pays an average of 300 with a start reset value of 85. All machines on the floor are eligible to participate in the progressive. Using a Promotion Administration Tool the casino would enter the following information Targeted progressive value 300 Progressive reset value 85 Machines included in progressive All Targeted progressive prize time 24 hours 0 minutes daily Number of Winners 1 Percentage of pot for each winner 100 and optionally the tolerance range for the desired numbers e.g. progressive value 300 25 . This criteria is typically categorized in table format for a casino administrator to complete including the percentage for each winner in the event of multiple winners in a single progressive game. Various examples of progressive parameter set up screens are shown in B and C .

Referring again to A and B in one preferred embodiment the group of gaming devices in the specific promotion is set up in the SMS slot management system and or the CMP CMS casino management personnel system system to create a promotion ID. This promotion ID is then assigned to a progressive ID in the progressive processing system . In this manner the eligible players that are available to win the specific progressive ID are controlled outside of the server of the progressive processing system . In this preferred embodiment the progressive processing system decides when a progressive prize will be awarded and the value of the progressive prize to be given. In such a preferred embodiment the previously existing servers in the casino select who will win the progressive prize. In this manner a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system is easily incorporated with slot floor systems in the field that have promotional capability.

Additionally the progressive processing system can be utilized by any business that seeks to offer promotional givebacks to their customers. In such an embodiment these businesses merely have to select winners from their customers when the progressive processing system notifies them to do so. Preferably the casino s other systems would manage player accounts and the computing devices as currently preformed. Typically these systems would not require the support of progressive processing system . In another preferred embodiment the software of the progressive processing system is tightly embedded into existing operating business servers.

A preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system includes a progressive engine . In a preferred embodiment the progressive engine performs several calculations utilized in the progressive game . These calculations are performed at predetermined time slices and time sub slices in accordance with the targeted progressive prize time . In one preferred embodiment a time slice is equal to 1 100of the total targeted length of time for the progressive to be awarded as set by casino personnel. In one such embodiment the progressive will be won 50 of the time on or by the targeted set time and will always be won by 125 of this desired time. In another preferred embodiment there is no absolute payout time prompt. A sub slice is yet a smaller slice of time within a time slice. Preferably a time sub slice is close to a minute in size but obviously will vary in length depending on the desired targeted length of time selected for awarding the progressive prize. At each sub slice of time the progressive engine tests for a winner. In a preferred embodiment the progressive engine uses time slices and sub slices to accommodate progressives of any length of time ranging from five minutes to five years as shown in .

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game a setup procedure is performed for each progressive game. Preferably this process includes resetting the progressive prize to the progressive reset value setting a progressive timer to the progressive start time setting a sub slice timer this should be the same as the progressive timer to begin setting the time slice counter to zero setting the time slice increment rate setting the number of time sub slices per time slice setting the time sub slice increment rate and starting the progressive game .

In one preferred embodiment of the progressive game the following formulas and calculations are employed. In a preferred embodiment the proper time slice increment rate is calculated by dividing the desired length of time for the progressive game by 100 which is the number of time slices in this embodiment. The result is the targeted length of each time slice in minutes. Thus in an example 24 hour progressive game period the time slice increment rate would be 14.4 minutes slice. During a tournament game the time based progressive game preferably uses values from a table based on the number of the current time slice.

Another preferred aspect of a progressive engine is the ability to emulate a traditional progressive game e.g. a bonus progressive game if desired that is tied to wagering activity on the gaming floor. In one preferred embodiment the progressive engine emulates the heart beat of the floor e.g. the number of players connected to the progressive gaming system but is not tied in anyway to the wagering activity.

Additionally in a preferred embodiment of the time based progressive game the number of time sub slices per time slice is calculated by first truncating the time slice increment rate. If the resulting value is less than one then the number of time sub slices per time slice is set to one. This ensures that there is always at least one time sub slice per time slice. Preferably there is always at least one time sub slice per time slice because the time based progressive engine tests for a progressive winner and increments the progressive prize based on the time sub slices. Therefore there must be at least one time sub slice per time slice in order to insure the math for the progressive game will work correctly. Accordingly in the 24 hour progressive game period example discussed above there are 14 time sub slices.

Continuing in a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the time sub slice increment rate is calculated by dividing the time slice increment rate by the number of time sub slices per time slice. In this manner the length of each sub slice is determined. Typically this value is close to one minute. Thus in an example 24 hour progressive game period the time sub slice increment rate is 14.4 minutes time slice incremental rate divided by 14 minutes number of time sub slices per time slice 61.7143 seconds.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game progressive gaming calculations are performed during every time sub slice interval of the progressive game by the progressive engine . Preferably at the start of a new sub slice the by the progressive engine runs a test to determine if a progressive prize is to be awarded at that time. Additionally the growth rate of the progressive prize for each sub slice is also determined at the start of a new sub slice. In a preferred embodiment these functions are repeated at the start of every time sub slice until the progressive prize is awarded. Moreover in a preferred embodiment of the progressive game it is possible for the progressive prize to be won instantly i.e. in the first time sub slice of the first time slice or for the progressive game to run until the game has passed the 100th time slice. In one preferred embodiment the progressive game is able to continue for many time slices past the 100time slice instead of having the progressive game incorporate a forced payout when the 100time slice is reached. In such an embodiment each of these time slices is the same length as the slices before the 100time slice. In one preferred embodiment the progressive game also incorporates one or more enticement factor calculations that run in the background on the system server independent of which particular progressive games are active . These calculations are backed up data every 15 minutes as well as returning data to the progressive engine on request.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system the progressive game allows players to have the opportunity to win the progressive prize as soon as the progressive game begins. In one preferred embodiment there is not any progressive prize value trigger that must be reached in order to allow the progressive prize to be eligible to be won other than the initiating of the progressive game itself. In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game a calculation is made for each time sub slice to determine if there is a win of the progressive prize. For each time sub slice there is a different number of remaining possible winning time sub slices. Therefore a calculation is performed at the beginning of every time sub slice for the length of the progressive game in order to determine whether the progressive prize is given. For each calculation the progressive game accesses an associated table see example Winning Time Slice Table below for the win value i.e. number of winning time slices of the current time slice.

Continuing in a preferred embodiment of the time based progressive game if the random number picked is less than or equal to the win value in the Winning Time Slice table for the current time slice then the progressive prize value the progressive pot is awarded. In a preferred embodiment the number of time sub slices is multiplied by 1 000 000 so that the win value from the table is comparable to the random number based on the entire time slice. For example if there is one time sub slice per time slice in a progressive game then there is a one in 1 000 000 chance of selecting a winning time slice. In this same manner referring to if there are 14 time sub slices then there is an eight in 14 000 000 chance of selecting a winning time slice. This mathematical profile is selected in order to create to casino administrator s desired payout curve. Moreover this mathematical profile is applicable to any length of tournament. In one preferred embodiment if the 125time slice is reached the progressive prize is automatically won on the first sub slice test. However in other preferred embodiments the progressive prize is automatically won at a different time slice or is never automatically won at any time slice.

In one preferred embodiment above table is loaded into the progressive processing system by selecting and dragging points on the payout curve after which the number of time slices of winning tickets is reverse calculated as well as the associated probability of winning. In one preferred embodiment the payout curve can be manually modified or alternatively the payout curve drawn for the user.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game if a win value is not selected for a time sub slice that produces a progressive prize then the progressive prize value is incremented. This is sometimes referred to as the pot growth rate. In one preferred embodiment the pot growth rate formula has a non linear growth rate. Additionally in one preferred embodiment the pot growth rate loosely associates the movement of the progressive pot value to the number of active players. However in another preferred embodiment the pot growth rate is not associated with the number of active players. In one specific embodiment the pot growth at any given minute is described by the following formula Base growth rate for current time slice 15 minute enticement factor sub slice enticement factor 

The formula in the above non limiting example calculates a dollar value to be added to the progressive pot value that is visible to the players and which can be won over the next time sub slice. In one specific embodiment components of the formula include 1 the desired overall pot growth for the entire length of the progressive game 2 base growth rate for sub slices in this time slice 3 a 15 minute floor activity enticement factor 4 a time sub slice random enticement factor. However other preferred embodiments of the progressive game include fewer components e.g. fewer enticement factors additional components e.g. more enticement factors or modified components e.g. different enticement factors without departing from the scope of the claimed invention.

In one specific non limiting example 300 is the desired or theoretical average value for the progressive game to distribute on a daily basis. In this non limiting example the reset value of the progressive pot is 85. Therefore the progressive pot grows during a targeted progressive game by 215 i.e. 300 minus 85 . Once again this desired progressive prize value of 300 is an average. If the progressive prize actually paid out every time that the progressive pot hit exactly 300 players would only play the progressive game just as the pot approached the 300 value.

As described above in a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the base growth rate formula for the progressive pot value is customizable. However a preferred embodiment of the progressive game further includes several pre designed growth rate formulas that can be utilized by a casino or other hosting establishment. One such pre designed growth rate formula component of the progressive game is a front loading curve for the progressive prize incrementing rate that increases quickly in the beginning and then later tapers off.

Examinations of casino information have shown that this type of front loading of a progressive prize value may increase progressive game play. In preferred embodiments of the progressive game this front loading curve is similar for all progressive games regardless of 1 the actual dollar amount being played on the progressive games and 2 the actual dollar amount being awarded for the progressive games. Preferably the base growth rate for time sub slices is the component of the formula that keeps the progressive pot tracking correctly. This base growth rate value is determined by locating a value in a Pot Growth table and multiplying that value by the remaining factors of the progressive incremental growth rate formula. Preferably the base growth rate remains the same for each time sub slice in a given time slice.

In a preferred embodiment the current time slice is utilized to locate a Pot Growth rate value on a Pot Growth table. In one specific non limiting example at time slice 4 the following formula is used to calculate the base growth rate for this time slice overall desired pot growth average reset pot growth value table time slice 10 000 OR 300 85 pot growth value table 4 10 000 OR 215 300 10 000 6.45 Total amount to add during this time slice 

In the above non limiting example the number 10 000 was incorporated into the formula to generate the Progressive Pot Growth table shown in . Dividing by 10 000 produces the correct amount of total dollars to increment the pot growth for the time slice. Continuing in this non limiting example the value 6.45 is the total amount to be added to the progressive prize value for this time slice. In a preferred embodiment this value is divided by the number of time sub slices per time slice. In the above non limiting example which is based off of a one day progressive game the progressive pot growth rate value is 14. However this value will vary depending on the length of the progressive game. In this regard a six month progressive would have approximately 1296 time sub slices per time slice. 6.45 14 Sub Slices 0.46 Base Growth rate for this time sub slice 

In one preferred embodiment the data in is entered manually by a casino administrator while in another preferred embodiment points on the payout curve are selected and dragged by a casino administrator in order to create the table.

A preferred embodiment of the progressive game includes what is referred to herein as an enticement factor. One specific non limiting example of an enticement factor is a 15 minute floor enticement factor. In a preferred embodiment the 15 minute enticement factor is configured to give players the impression that the progressive growth rate is linked to actual progressive play on the gaming floor. In one preferred embodiment the 15 minute enticement factor produces up to 23.75 of the base growth rate of the progressive pot for a given time sub slice. Alternatively this information may be manually entered by a casino administrator.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game this component of the front loading curve utilizes a separate calculation that is performed on a server that tracks player activity during a rolling 24 hour period and return values to any progressive game upon request. For example in one preferred embodiment the progressive engine requests a rank value from this enticement factor calculation. This enticement factor calculation uses in the following formula Rank 47.5 200

The result of this formula is a value between 0.2375 and 0.2375. Notably this equates to the 23.75 desired range of change. In the above example this value is then multiplied by the base growth rate for this sub slice in order to determine the final value.

In the following non limiting example an example rank of 87 is selected for illustrative purposes Base Growth Rate of Time Sub slice Rank 47.5 200 OR in this example 0.46 87 47.5 200 OR 0.46 0.1950 0.09 for the 15 minute floor enticement factor 

As described above a preferred embodiment of the progressive game utilizes another calculation to produce for a 15 minute floor enticement factor or other enticement factor in another preferred embodiment . A 15 minute interval is a preferred time interval because this time interval correlates with the current network capacity or interval rating for many casino systems. In one embodiment the progressive game performs this additional calculation every 15 minutes preferably on the quarter hour. In order to perform this calculation the progressive game tracks the floor activity for the last 15 minutes. This floor activity value is typically captured by an Interval Rating Engine or other appropriate engine in the progressive processing system . Referring now to in a preferred embodiment the floor activity value is logged to a rolling table that keeps this value for each 15 minute period over the last 24 hours. Preferably this rolling table includes 96 rows i.e. four 15 minute periods per hour multiplied by 24 hours . As shown in each time a new value is calculated this new value replaces the oldest value on the rolling table from 24 hours ago. In a preferred embodiment this enticement factor calculation is constantly performed regardless of whether there is any active progressive game play. This ensures that there are always floor activity values for the last 24 hours if a progressive game is to start at any time.

Additionally a preferred embodiment of the progressive game requires that the enticement factor background process also sort the floor activity values into a second table as shown in . This enables the time order to be preserved in the first table i.e. the rolling table. The enticement factor background process sorts these floor activity values by the number of players from the least number of players to the greatest number of players. In this manner the time period with the biggest value would be in row . After the time periods have been sorted by activity level the enticement factor background process returns the rank of the current time slice i.e. a number between 1 and 96 to the progressive game upon request.

Another preferred embodiment of the progressive game includes a different enticement factor. A non limiting example of another enticement factor is a minute by minute floor enticement factor. In a preferred embodiment the minute by minute enticement factor is configured to give players the impression that the progressive growth rate has more life e.g. a more erratic less predictable growth rate . Preferably the minute by minute enticement causes the progressive growth rate to erratically move in a 10 range. In other preferred embodiments the minute by minute enticement causes the progressive growth rate to erratically move in a 5 or 15 range. In one specific non limiting example the following formula defines the minute by minute floor enticement factor Random 2000 1000 10 000

This formula returns a value between 0.1 and 0.1 with four decimal point accuracy. This equates to a 10 range. In a preferred embodiment this minute by minute floor enticement factor is multiplied by the base growth rate for this sub slice to determine the final progressive value. In one specific non limiting example the random number equating to the minute by minute floor enticement factor is 0.0473. Base Growth rate for this sub slice Random 2000 1000 10 000 Or in this example 0.46 0.0473 0.02

Therefore in a preferred embodiment the final calculation for the determining the progressive pot growth rate of the front loading curve utilizes the above described components of the formula curve. In one specific embodiment the pot growth at any given minute is described by the following formula Base growth rate for sub slice 15 min. enticement factor min. by min. enticement factor Or incorporating the above selected sample values 0.46 0.02 0.09 0.53 total to be added to the progressive pot during this sub slice .

Referring now to a logic flow diagram of a preferred embodiment of the time based progressive game is shown. details the process that is undergone during the execution of the time based progressive game .

Furthermore with respect to the distribution of progressive funds illustrates a comparison of the percentage of the theoretical average of the progressive pot value i.e. percentage of the targeted progressive prize value versus the cumulative chance to win. This comparison chart elucidates the front loading concept that is employed by a preferred embodiment of the progressive game . In one preferred embodiment the progressive prize has a lower cumulative probability of being awarded early in the time period and increases to a higher cumulative probability of being awarded later in the time period.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system the cumulative percent chance to win is a statistical technique used to create a winning time slice table as shown above. The winning time slice table is referenced at each time sub slice to determine the chance for a progressive prize to be won at that time sub slice. In a preferred embodiment the winning time slice table has 125 values that represent the number of winning time sub slices out of 1 000 000 in any given time slice. The winning time slice table contains cumulative percent chance values. In this regard the cumulative percent chance of selecting a progressive prize at any given time slice increases the closer that time slice is to the targeted progressive prize time. In a preferred embodiment the cumulative percent chance is within a range of time that is acceptable to allow the progressive game to have a broad enough range of lengths that players are unable to determine the ending time of the progressive game with any degree of accuracy.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system the winning time slice table is generated using a spreadsheet that includes automated formulas. This enables a user to fill in some data in the table and then have the remainder of the data automatically generated. In a preferred embodiment the spreadsheet shows the cumulative payback percent chance at each time slice. One example of the formula for finding how many time slices exist at each time slice is 

Time Slice Number where the value added to the exponent is equal to the Time Slice Number divided by a value based upon the slice number and key time slice settings. In a preferred embodiment the divide value based on slice number is determined after the user decides what time slices they want to effect and the cumulative percent chance to win at each time slice.

In one specific example shown below the value for time slices 1 80 is 168.59 Original div value . This value is used in the Additive to factorial column. Any change to this value then filters through the spreadsheet thereby producing a new percent chance to win value for all time slices. Preferably setting a goal seek value in the Used for Goal Seek column changes the value in the Original Div Value column. In one specific example this is a built in function of the spreadsheet.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system a casino operator creates an original table. In one such embodiment an operator creates a probability curve by choosing one or more key time slices. The operator then decides what percent of the winners should occur by the chosen key slices. For example in one embodiment the 80time slice is selected as the time slice by which to have 10 of all progressive prizes are to be awarded. Preferably at the 100time slice 50 of the progressive prizes have been won so as to make the overall average length of the progressive games be approximately equal to the targeted award time. Continuing at the 115slice 95 of the progressive prizes have been won. Finally in one preferred embodiment at the 125time slice 100 of the progressive prizes have been won thereby restricting the top end length of the progressive game to be 25 over the targeted progressive time. In this one preferred embodiment the 25 value was chosen arbitrarily and can be modified or removed altogether to suit customer preference.

Preferably adding to this 25 in value entails adding corresponding additional time slices after the 125time slice. In other preferred embodiments there are multiple key time slices both before and after the 100time slice. However even in such preferred embodiments the target for the cumulative percent chance to win at each key slice becomes larger as the slice number increases.

In another step involved with creating an original table the user would then seek for the desired percent for the first key slice by changing the original div value divisional value . Continuing the user would repeat this process for each remaining key and finally for the 125time slice. The winning tickets column is then filled with the correct number of time sub slices to ensure the progressive plays as intended.

In another aspect of a preferred embodiment the spreadsheet is used to calculate for each time slice the cumulative chance for the progressive prize to be won. This is determined by 1 finding the percent chance to fail for a given time slice 2 multiplying the percent chance to fail for all time slices up to a given point i.e. this is the cumulative percent chance to fail at this point and 3 subtracting the cumulative chance to fail from 100 percent to find the percent chance to win.

In the table above at Time Slice 1 there is 1 winning time sub slice. There are 999 999 chances in 1 000 000 to lose i.e. 99.9999 chance to lose . As this is the first time slice 99.999 is also the cumulative percent chance to fail. The chance to win at this point is then 100 99.9999 or 0.0001 .

Referring now to the table and time slice 2 there are two winning time sub slices and a 99.9998 chance to lose on this time slice. By multiplying 99.9999 i.e. the cumulative chance to fail at time slice 1 times 99.9998 i.e. the cumulative chance to fail at time slice 2 it is determined that there is a 99.997 cumulative percent chance to lose at time slice 2. Correspondingly this translates into a 0.0003 chance to win at time slice 2.

Referring now to the table and time slice 3 there are 5 winning time sub slices and a 99.9995 chance to lose on this time slice. By multiplying 99.9997 i.e. the cumulative chance to fail at time slice 2 times 99.9995 i.e. the cumulative chance to fail at time slice 3 it is determined that there is a 99.992 cumulative chance to lose at time slice 3. This correlates with a 0.0008 chance to win at time slice 3.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game after the progressive engine has determined that there is a winner for the current time sub slice the system then randomly selects a winner of the progressive game using a random number generating algorithm. In one preferred embodiment a player is eligible to win the progressive prize if they have a player tracking card inserted in a game machine that is eligible to win that specific progressive prize at the time the progressive prize is selected. For example if the progressive prize was awarded for all nickel machines on the floor the progressive game would select a winner randomly from one of the player tracking cards inserted into any nickel machine on the casino floor. In the case of a progressive game that awards to multiple winners multiple cards are chosen as winners in accordance with the set up of the progressive game. In these types of multi winner progressive games each player may win an equal share or there may be a range of payouts.

If there are no players playing on eligible gaming machines for a specific progressive game at the time that the progressive game determines there is a win for that progressive game the progressive prize will be awarded to the next player s to insert a player tracking card into an eligible game machine . In another preferred embodiment the progressive prize is deposited into a winning player s account without even requiring the player to be present. In one such embodiment the winning player is then notified of the deposit by e mail mail or other known means.

In another preferred embodiment of the progressive game all active players on the floor are eligible to win the progressive prize not only the player with inserted player tracking cards. In one embodiment the winning non player tracking card player must use the progressive prize at that winning machine since the player does not have a player tracking card to associate the winning with that player.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game progressive prize is then dispensed to the winning player by crediting the player s eGameCash bucket. As shown in a player is able to view his or her eGameCash bucket screen as well as other game setup screens and personal account screens typically via the user interface in the progressive processing system . In one embodiment as shown in these credits in the player s eGameCash bucket can be transferred as shown on the eGameCash purchase screen to the base game upon request from the player following PIN entry or some other suitable means of player identification . Additionally personal account activity screens are also displayed in . Referring now to a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system also includes a tournament selection screen game setup screen for modifying a bingo game and a personal account display screen that shows both cashable and uncashable funds for a system game in the same display screen. shows a progressive game displaying the attract mode screen on the user interface as well as an award display screen that is shown to a player after winning a progressive prize.

In a preferred embodiment of the progressive game the application design of the progressive game includes many various programs. Preferably such programs include by way of example only and not by way of limitation a master maintenance program including a graphic user interface a link maintenance program a promotion detail maintenance program a progressive update program a progressive winner program a progressive increment override program a Pick the Winner program and a create promotion program machines and or player .

The master maintenance program enables data entry for the promotion master file. This program calls the link maintenance program and enables the user to set up the progressive link.

Referring now to one specific non limiting embodiment of a user interface shown in an iView type device is described herein in greater detail. The user interface is sometimes referred to herein as additional in that the user interface is preferably separate from the gaming screen or other gaming presentation . Further the user interface is sometimes referred to herein as embedded in that the user interface preferably includes its own processor in some preferred embodiments of the invention. The functionality of the user interface includes by way of example only and not by way of limitation the ability to display animation multimedia and other web type content. The embedded additional user interface enables presentation of additional information e.g. enhanced player information to a player or potential player through the web page display screen in an exciting eye catching format while not interfering with the normal gaming processes being displayed on the gaming screen . Further the embedded additional user interface does not interfere with the normal gaming hardware in the gaming machine but rather is easily integrated into a gaming machine .

In situations involving multiple gaming machine or gaming component manufacturers an embedded additional user interface can be incorporated into a game machine either originally or by retrofitting without requiring access to the game logic or other gaming systems that might be proprietary and inaccessible with a game machine from another gaming manufacturer. Thus in a preferred embodiment of the invention the embedded additional user interface which includes a web page display screen for presenting supplementary information to a player is incorporated into a gaming machine in addition to the standard gaming screen typically found in a gaming machine. The embedded additional user interface may also be incorporated into a gaming machine that utilizes a gaming region e.g. a reel spinner instead of a standard game machine . This supplemental information may include general gaming information player specific information player excitement and interest captivation content advertising content targeted or otherwise and the like. Further in other preferred embodiments the embedded additional user interface may have the ability to interact with the game logic of the gaming processor and thus provide further functionality such as bonus games and or the ability to incorporate awards promotional offers or gifts from the web page display screen to the game machine . Moreover the web page display screen may display supplemental information in an attract mode when there is no game play occurring.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention the embedded additional user interface is used to make casino services more accessible and friendly to casino players. In one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface is designed to interface with the hardware configuration of game platforms currently employed in an existing gaming communication systems network thus decreasing implementation costs for the casino. A standard gaming network interface to the systems network such as a Mastercom system includes a multi drop bus method of communicating to a keypad and display. The Mastercom system is available from Bally Manufacturing and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 429 361 to Raven et al. incorporated herein by reference. One such currently utilized bus is an EPI bus Enhanced Player Interface bus which uses industry standard IC hardware and signaling.

In one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface is used to replace upgrade an EPI device. Preferably the embedded additional user interface replaces the EPI device in the game machine in a plug and play manner. In other words the old EPI device can be unplugged from the bus and the new embedded additional user interface can simply be plugged into the IC bus of the gaming machine where the user interface utilizes the currently employed industry standard IC hardware and signaling without requiring any further modification. The embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface reads incoming IC data content translates the data into a web authoring language e.g. HTML DHTML XML MACROMEDIA FLASH animated Gifs and JAVA Applets and maps the data to the web page display screen . In this manner the previous IC data messages which were typically presented on a two line twenty character VF display are automatically transformed by the embedded additional user interface into an attention grabbing animated multimedia web page style format. This results in enhanced player satisfaction and excitement with extremely minimal retrofitting requirements.

Since in one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface utilizes IC hardware and signaling this enables the user interface to speak and understand the IC protocol message set and thus communicate directly with the gaming processor of the gaming machine or other networked devices in the same fashion in which the gaming processor previously communicated with the EPI device. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment of the invention the functionality of the previously utilized hardware e.g. the EPI device is replaced and substantially upgraded with the integration of the embedded additional user interface into the gaming machine . As such the external hardware of any such system components e.g. a keypad and a two line twenty character VF display is eliminated.

As stated above in one preferred embodiment the incoming data received by the embedded additional user interface is IC signaling protocol however in other preferred embodiments other serial communication protocols or electronic communication format are utilized. Preferably the embedded processor communicates with the gaming processor and or other connected devices over an IC bus or over another serial communications bus in embodiments that utilize another protocol . The web page display screen of the embedded additional user interface is preferably a color graphic touch screen display. Preferably the embedded processor is at least a 32 bit processor. A preferred embodiment utilizes a 32 bit processor because cryptographic techniques such as SHA 1 and DSA algorithms are written and operate natively on a 32 bit system. Additionally the Microsoft Windows environment which is utilized in some preferred embodiments of the invention is also 32 bit. Further the internal operating system of the embedded additional user interface is preferably customized to match the specific hardware to which the internal operating system attaches.

Preferably the embedded additional user interface is an embedded computer board that in addition to the embedded processor and the web page display screen further includes a removable memory storage device e.g. COMPACT FLASH card as shown in and a network adapter port. Content and feature updates to the embedded additional user interface are accomplished by physically swapping out the Memory storage device or other memory storage device . Thus in order to retrieve data from the embedded additional user interface the data is accessed by physically removing and reading the Memory storage device .

In one preferred embodiment the internal operating system utilized by the embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface is WINDOWS CE version 4.2 or higher . Preferably the embedded additional user interface is built upon a PXA255 based board developed by the Kontron Corporation. Additionally in a preferred embodiment of the embedded additional user interface the browser control for the web page display screen is MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER 6.0 or higher which is shipped standard with WINDOWS CE 4.2 the preferred internal operating system for the embedded processor .

Referring now to in this preferred embodiment content may be locally downloaded. Specifically in one preferred embodiment the content is updated through a physical USB or other connection that is used to download the new content. In one preferred embodiment the data on the Memory storage device can be accessed by connecting a separate computer to the network adapter port of the embedded additional user interface . This embodiment allows updating the contents of the operating system changing the operating system itself and receiving data from the Memory storage device . Physical removal of the Memory storage device is also still be an option for update and inspection of files on the embedded additional user interface .

In one preferred embodiment a portable computer is used to store and publish data content to the Memory storage device on the embedded additional user interface as well as to receiving data from the Memory storage device on the embedded additional user interface. In this embodiment all content on the embedded additional user interface is authenticated as if it were a gaming machine.

In another preferred embodiment a network adapter port is run on the embedded computer board of the user interface . This embodiment also includes a boot loader. Further in this embodiment the portable computer described above includes components for use in uploading data to and downloading data from the Memory storage device on the embedded additional user interface . Specifically the components that run on the portable computer are for moving new data content to the embedded additional user interface and for validation and verification of the data content that is on the embedded additional user interface. Preferably all data that is used to update the Memory storage device moves to or from the embedded additional user interface over the single built in network adapter port on the board.

Prior to the advent of the embedded additional user interface of the invention gaming regulators would have been unwilling to allow casino administrators to design their own content. However due to the cryptographic technology implemented by the embedded processor in the embedded additional user interface a certification process is provided by the invention with sufficient security for gaming regulators to allow casino administrators to design their own content. Specifically in one preferred embodiment the certification process offered ensures authentication and non repudiation of the casino administrator designed web content. Preferably in the invention the certification process provided further ensures auditability and traceability. Various cryptographic technologies such as authentication and non repudiation described herein below are utilized in preferred embodiments of the invention to provide sufficient security for gaming regulators to allow casino administrators to design their own content.

In one preferred embodiment this certification process is used to certify signed content created by the casino owners in the same manner that a signed program is certified. Preferably PKI Public Key Infrastructure is utilized in the certification process. PKI is a system of digital certificates Certificate Authorities and other registration authorities that verify authenticity and validity. In one preferred embodiment a new tier or second PKI is created that is rooted in the primary PKI and that leverages the capabilities of the certificate e.g. a x509 certificate that allow for limited access. Thus this preferred embodiment allows the attributes within the certificate to be used to provide levels of code access and acceptance in the gaming industry.

In one embodiment the content is protected by digital signature verification using DSA Digital Signature Algorithm or RSA Rivest Shamir Adleman technology. In this regard the content is preferably protected using digital signature verification so that any unauthorized changes are easily identifiable. A digital signature is the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature in that it binds an individual s identity to a piece of information. A digital signature scheme typically consists of a signature creation algorithm and an associated verification algorithm. The digital signature creation algorithm is used to produce a digital signature. The digital signature verification algorithm is used to verify that a digital signature is authentic i.e. that it was indeed created by the specified entity . In another embodiment the content is protected using other suitable technology.

In one preferred embodiment a Secure Hash Function 1 SHA 1 is used to compute a 160 bit hash value from the data content or firmware contents. This 160 bit hash value which is also called an abbreviated bit string is then processed to create a signature of the game data using a one way private signature key technique called Digital Signature Algorithm DSA . The DSA uses a private key of a private key public key pair and randomly or pseudo randomly generated integers to produce a 320 bit signature of the 160 bit hash value of the data content or firmware contents. This signature is stored in the database in addition to the identification number.

In another preferred embodiment the invention utilizes a Message Authentication Code MAC . A MAC is a specific type of message digest in which a secret key is included as part of the fingerprint. Whereas a normal digest consists of a hash data the MAC consists of a hash key data . Thus a MAC is a bit string that is a function of both data either plaintext or ciphertext and a secret key. A MAC is attached to data in order to allow data authentication. Further a MAC may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. Typically a MAC is a one way hash function that takes as input both a symmetric key and some data. A symmetric key algorithm is an algorithm for cryptography that uses the same cryptographic key to encrypt and decrypt the message.

A MAC can be generated faster than using digital signature verification technology however a MAC is not as robust as digital signature verification technology. Thus when speed of processing is critical the use of a MAC provides an advantage because it can be created and stored more rapidly than digital signature verification technology.

In one preferred embodiment the authentication technique utilized is a bKey electronic key device. A bKey is an electronic identifier that is tied to a particular individual. In this manner any adding accessing or modification of content that is made using a bKey for authentication is linked to the specific individual to which that bKey is associated. Accordingly an audit trail is thereby established for regulators and or other entities that require this kind of data or system authentication.

Referring now to in one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface connects to an Ethernet networked backbone instead of a local system network. Currently most casino networks are not Ethernet networked but rather are smaller more simplistic local system networks. Thus in this Ethernet networked backbone embodiment the current system network is replaced by an industry standard Ethernet backbone such as 10 100 base T Ethernet running over Cat 3 4 5 6 or higher. Thus a standard 10 100 base T Ethernet card is added to the processor in this embodiment. Preferably the network employs TCP IP HTTP and XML messaging or a variant of XML. Nevertheless any suitable protocol may be used.

Further in another preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface connects to a full featured back end download configuration server through the above described Ethernet networked backbone as shown in . In such an embodiment the full featured server can schedule downloads of content gaming or otherwise as well as upload information from the gaming machines such as what options the gaming machines currently possess. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment the primary use of the server is as a data download and data retrieval server. While this server does upload and download web content style information it is typically not connected to the World Wide Web. This server must be authenticated just like a game machine to make the content served to the embedded additional user interface acceptable to the gaming regulators. Preferably utilization of the Ethernet networked backbone and the server provides many system benefits including but not limited to reliability maintainability security content staging content testing deployment procedures and incident recovery. In one embodiment deliverables also preferably include content templates and guidelines for casino owners and administrators to create their own web content for deployment to the web server. In one embodiment the web server has its content authenticated in the same manner as the embedded additional user interface to allow content to be downloaded to the web page display screen .

Referring now to in another preferred embodiment of the invention the functions previously performed by the gaming monitoring unit as shown in of the gaming machine are supported by the embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface . Otherwise stated the GMU code is transitioned from the gaming monitoring unit into the embedded processor in the embedded additional user interface . Accordingly such a configuration removes the need for the gaming monitoring unit in the gaming machine . This results in a significant reduction in the amount and complexity of the hardware as well as completing a phased transition of more traditional style gaming machines into more modernized upgraded gaming machines.

Thus in such a preferred embodiment the invention is directed towards an embedded additional user interface that is incorporated into a gaming machine the gaming machine in turn including a game machine or other appropriate gaming region e.g. spinning reels but does not include a gaming monitoring unit . Such an embedded additional user interface still includes a web content capable display screen and an embedded processor . Once again the web content capable display screen presents web information to a user via the display screen. The embedded processor preferably utilizes an internal operating system. Furthermore in this embodiment the embedded processor additionally includes standard gaming monitoring unit functionality GMU code since it replaces the gaming monitoring unit in the gaming machine . As before the embedded processor reads incoming data translates the data into a web protocol web authoring language if necessary and maps the data to the web content capable display screen .

In a preferred embodiment information can also be input by a user into the web page display screen of the user interface . The web page display screen of the user interface employs a virtual keypad. Further the user interface uses a keypad dictionary that allows a user to be able to enter a vastly greater amount of information than was previously possible using a twelve digit VF keypad. For example the virtual key on the touch screen that is displayed by the browser is pressed by a user. This calls the keypad object by calling its dispatch interface with a string that identifies which virtual key was pressed. The keypad object looks up the string in the dictionary object that has been loaded at initialization time with a set of keys to return when that string is passed to it. When it retrieves this set of zero or more key characters it passes them to the GMU by calling the interface exposed by the object.

Typically a network interface or equivalent system is used to control the flow of funds used with the gaming machine within a particular casino. By utilizing the embedded additional user interface of the invention the gaming network interface can be instructed to move funds between player s accounts and gaming devices by merely touching the web page display screen . In addition many other more sophisticated commands and instructions may be provided. Thus the embedded additional user interface improves the player and casino employee interface to the gaming machine directly at the gaming device itself.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention the web page display screen of the embedded additional user interface enables a player to be shown player messages in an animated multimedia web content style environment. These messages would previously have been displayed in a significantly more mundane format on a separate display device e.g. a two line VF display device . In some preferred embodiments touch screen buttons in the web page display screen are used by the player to navigate between windows in web page display screen and allow access to system functions such as cashless withdraw balance requests system requests points redemption and the like. In other preferred embodiments of the invention the web page display screen utilizes various other data input techniques commonly known in the art instead of the touch screen data entry. Thus implementation of the embedded additional user interface is an efficient highly beneficial and substantial upgrade to a gaming machine that greatly increases the functionality over what was previously possible using an EPI device.

In one preferred embodiment text data messages are translated into web page navigation requests by the embedded processor and then displayed on the web page display screen as shown and discussed with respect to below. Script languages such as JAVA SCRIPT and VB SCRIPT are also utilized for some of the web pages. Preferably the embedded additional user interface emulates the twelve digit keypad and the two by twenty VF display on the web page display screen which has touch screen capabilities. In this embodiment commands that were previously displayed on the two by twenty VF display are matched to a corresponding URL and a browser is used to render the page on the web page display screen . The web pages displayed contain touch screen keys that effectively emulate hardware keys.

With reference to in one preferred embodiment of the invention a dictionary URL approach is used for translating the data messages into web page information. In this manner data messages are looked up in a dictionary data file where they can be redirected to an attractive URL. The embedded processor responds to requests on the IC bus that were intended for the prior art enhanced player interface EPI device VF display. The web page display screen is not a passive display device like traditional PC monitors but rather the display screen must respond to commands with text type responses. These requests include initialization requests status requests and display requests. With reference to as each text data message to be displayed is passed into the embedded processor the processor calls a URL Dictionary to look up a URL with which to replace the text data message. Once the substitution is complete the embedded processor instructs the web page display screen to present or navigate to the appropriate web page.

Accordingly with reference to a URL Dictionary component is used to map a text string sent from the embedded processor and intended for the display on the two by twenty VF display to a URL that can be used to display a much more visually enhanced graphical representation of the same message. Thus the URL Dictionary component contains a listing of the possible text messages to be supported that could be sent from the embedded processor and a mapping to a set of the desired eye catching web content to be displayed on the web page display screen . In this event that a message is not in the URL Dictionary such a message is mapping to a page that substitutes for the two line mode.

In the preferred embodiments described above the embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface reads incoming IC data messages translates the IC data messages into a web authoring language e.g. HTML DHTML XML MACROMEDIA FLASH and maps the newly translated web page data message to the web page display screen . Additionally the embedded additional user interface can also read incoming data messages that are already in a web authoring language e.g. HTML DHTML XML MACROMEDIA FLASH and map this web page data to the web page display screen . Further and highly advantageously a preferred embodiment of the invention also allows casinos that are using the embedded additional user interface to design and use their own content thereby giving the casinos the ability to decide what the web page presented on the web page display screen of the user interface will look like.

The potential advantages of utilizing the embedded additional user interface of the invention are numerous.

Referring now to a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system as shown in A and B information utilized by the system to generate a progressive game includes by way of example only and not by way of limitation the following preferred specification parameters average length of time is in minutes 15 characters leading zeros all amount fields are in whole dollars 15 characters leading zeros progressive game code is generated on the iSERIES server 8 characters the system PROG.ID is generated by the engine 8 characters NUMBER OF SLOTS is generated on the iSERIES server 10 characters leading zeros number of slots included in the promotion NUMBER CARDED SLOTS is generated on the iSERIES server 10 characters leading zeros number of slots machines included in a promotion with player cards inserted and SEQUENCE NUMBER generated on the iSERIES server 3 characters leading zeros.

In one specific preferred embodiment in order to generate a new promotion progressive game to the progressive processing system the user first creates a new promotion on the iSERIES server. Next the SMS slot management system programming detects the new promotion progressive game should be activated and generates an ADD TO ENGINE transaction. Preferably the transaction is then sent to a data queue SDSM0068. In one preferred embodiment the ADD transaction written to the data queue contains the following data fields 

In one preferred embodiment the connection program on the iSERIES server reads the data queue and forwards the ADD TO ENGINE transaction to the engine . When the engine receives the ADD TO ENGINE transaction the engine generates a PROG.ID CODE and responds with the following data back to the iSERIES server. Preferably the connection program writes the following image to a data queue SDSM0066.

In a preferred embodiment the SMS programming on the iSERIES server reads the data queue SDSM0066 and updates the promotion record as having been added and activated on the engine . Additionally the engine PROG.ID is linked to the new promotion progressive game code.

In one specific preferred embodiment in order to delete remove an existing promotion progressive game on the progressive processing system the user first flags the existing promotion for deletion on the iSERIES server. Preferably the SMS programming then generates a DELETE FROM ENGINE transaction and sends this transaction to a data queue SDSM0068. In one preferred embodiment the DELETE transaction written to the data queue contains the following data fields 

In a preferred embodiment the connection program on the iSERIES server reads the data queue and forwards the DELETE FROM ENGINE transaction to the engine . When the engine receives the DELETE FROM ENGINE transaction it removes the progressive game from its active progressive games and responds with the following data back to the iSERIES server. Preferably the connection program writes the following image to a data queue SDSM0066.

In a preferred embodiment the number of slots and number of carded slots in a promotion progressive game may require updating. Preferably the iSERIES server SMS programming periodically updates each active promotion game Number of Assets and Number of Carded Assets . Once the iSERIES server has been updated it notifies progressive processing system of the updated values with an UPDATE NUMBERS transaction and sends the transaction to a data queue SDSM0068. Preferably the UPDATE NUMBERS transaction written to the data queue contains the following data fields 

In a preferred embodiment the connection program on the iSERIES server reads the data queue and forwards the UPDATE NUMBERS transaction to the engine . When the engine receives a UPDATE NUMBERS for the promotion it uses these numbers to compute the value of the promotion progressive prize. Preferably the engine does not need to respond to the UPDATE NUMBERS transactions.

In a preferred embodiment the promotion progressive game may be required to obtain promotional prize values from the engine . The iSERIES server SMS programming periodically acquires the active promotional progressive prize values for each active promotion progressive prize from the engine using a GET CURRENT VALUE transaction which sends the transaction to a data queue SDSM0068. Preferably the GET CURRENT VALUE transaction written to the data queue contains the following data fields 

In a preferred embodiment the connection program on the iSERIES server reads the data queue and forwards the GET CURRENT VALUE transaction to the engine . Preferably when the engine receives a GET CURRENT VALUE transaction for a promotional progressive game it responds with the following data to the iSERIES server. Preferably the connection program writes the following image to a data queue SDSM0066.

In a preferred embodiment the SMS programming on the iSERIES server reads data queue SDSM0066 and updates the promotional progressive prize value with the current cash value from the engine .

Referring now to another aspect of a preferred embodiment of the progressive processing system when the engine has determined that it is time for a promotional progressive prize to be awarded the engine generates a SELECT WINNER VALUE transaction. The engine informs the iSERIES server of the win event by sending the following transaction to the iSERIES server. Preferably it also stops incrementing the promotional progressive prize s value. In a preferred embodiment the iSERIES server connection program writes the following image to a data queue SDSM0066.

In a preferred embodiment the SMS programming on the iSERIES server reads the data queue SDSM0066 updates the promotional progressive prize s value and selects a winning player.

Once the progressive processing system indicates that the criteria has been met for awarding the progressive prize for a promotional progressive game the iSERIES server programming selects a winner of the progressive prize. Specifically the iSERIES server programming reads all SMS active slot machine asset records from the active assets file SFPAT and builds a work file SFPP7 . In one preferred embodiment the slot machine selection only includes slot machines with 1 a player card inserted 2 where the player s card type matches the card type s assigned to be included in the promotion 3 where the slot machine s zone on the casino floor matches the zone s assigned to be include in the promotion and 4 where the slot machine s SMS manufacture code matches the manufacture code s to be included in the promotion. Preferably the work file SFPP7 contains the following data 

In a preferred embodiment once all included assets records have been written into the work file the number of included records is known. Preferably the programming uses a random number program to generate a random number between one and the number of records in the work file SFPP7. In a preferred embodiment this record contains the winning player s account number and the slot machine asset number. Preferably the progressive processing system designates this player as the winning player to the promotional progressive game . In a preferred embodiment the system broadcasts transactions to all slot machines on the casino floor announcing the winner as well as sending a transaction to the slot machine of the winning player announcing the selected player as winner.

If no winner selected the iSERIES server programming passes by the selecting a winner transactions until the next cycle e.g. approximately 15 seconds to one minute . Preferably once the SMS programming on the iSERIES server selects a winning player it notifies the engine of the winner with a POST WINNER DATA transaction and sends the transaction to a data queue SDSM0068. In a preferred embodiment the POST WINNER DATA transaction written to the data queue contains the following data fields 

In a preferred embodiment the connection program on the iSERIES server reads the data queue and forwards the POST WINNER DATA transaction to the engine . When the engine receives the POST WINNER DATA transaction it transmits the winning player data to any signage connected thereto. Preferably the engine does not need to respond to the POST WINNER transaction.
