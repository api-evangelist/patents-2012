Electronic devices such as smartphones and tablet computers are sometimes equipped with cameras. Cameras may for example be used to allow a user to capture a video or a still photograph.

Electronic devices with cameras typically provide a number of camera features which are provided by hardware and software of the electronic devices. For example such devices sometimes have the ability to zoom focus on a subject and trigger a camera flash. Electronic devices sometimes have the ability to perform image processing on a captured image. For example electronic devices are sometimes configured to remove a red eye effect apply a software based zoom or to provide another effect.

Such camera features of electronic devices are typically limited by the hardware and or software capabilities of the electronic device.

Other example embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed descriptions in conjunction with the drawings.

Referring first to a top view of two example electronic devices is illustrated. The electronic devices include a first electronic device and a second electronic device .

In the example embodiment illustrated the first electronic device is a smartphone and the second electronic device is a tablet computer. A smartphone is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capability than a basic non smart cellular phone. For example a smartphone may have the ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.

A tablet computer which may also be referred to as a tablet is an electronic device which is generally larger than a mobile phone such as a smartphone or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized.

The electronic device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna .

A user of the electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using an input interface in conjunction with the display . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the electronic device provides telephony functions and may operate as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. a voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the electronic device .

As illustrated in the software modules may include operating system software and one or more additional applications or modules such as for example a camera feature sharing module an instant messaging application and or a secure communication application .

In the example embodiment of the camera feature sharing module the instant messaging application and the secure communication application are illustrated as being implemented as stand alone applications . However in other example embodiments the camera feature sharing module the instant messaging application and or the secure communication application could be provided by another application or module such as for example the operating system software . Furthermore while the camera feature sharing module the instant messaging application and the secure communication application are each illustrated with a single block the functions or features provided by any of the camera feature sharing module the instant messaging application and or the secure communication application could in at least some embodiments be divided up and implemented by a plurality of applications and or modules. Similarly in at least some embodiments features of two or more of these applications or modules could be provided by a single application or software module.

The camera feature sharing module is configured to allow the electronic device to enter a camera feature sharing mode with another electronic device having a similarly configured camera feature sharing module . In the camera feature sharing mode the electronic device which may be referred to as a first electronic device is permitted to access a camera related feature of another electronic device which may be referred to as a second electronic device using the short range communication module . Similarly in the camera feature sharing mode the electronic device which may be referred to as a first electronic device allows another electronic device which may be referred to as a second electronic device to access a camera related feature of the electronic device i.e. of the first electronic device using the short range communication module .

Accordingly when the camera feature sharing module places the electronic device in the camera feature sharing mode bi directional sharing of camera related features is provided on the electronic device . That is the electronic device permits another electronic device to access a camera related feature and is also itself permitted to access a camera related feature of the other electronic device.

In at least some embodiments in the camera feature sharing mode the electronic device which may be the first electronic device described with reference to is permitted to control a flash of another electronic device which may be the second electronic device described with reference to . Similarly a first electronic device may allow its flash to be controlled by a second electronic device . Accordingly in at least some embodiments in the camera feature sharing mode one electronic device may act as a camera and another electronic device may act as an auxiliary flash. The electronic device which acts as an auxiliary flash may for example be directed at a subject which the electronic device which acts as a camera is taking a picture of. For example where the first electronic device is to act as a camera and the second electronic device acts as a flash the flash of the second electronic device may be directed at the side of a subject and the camera of the first electronic device may be directed at the front of a subject. When a user of one of the electronic devices wishes to capture an image the flash on the second electronic device is triggered and the camera on the first electronic device captures an image. The flash on the first electronic device may in at least some embodiments be triggered concurrently with the flash on the second electronic device .
