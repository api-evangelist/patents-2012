This invention relates to direction finding DF systems and more particularly to systems for finding the angle of arrival of radio frequency signals received from a transmitter.

DF systems have receiving antennas located at a DF site for receiving a target signal from a transmitter located at some bearing angle from the DF site. DF systems determine the angle of arrival AOA of the target signal at the DF site but typically do not determine the distance between the DF site and the transmitter.

Geolocation systems find the geolocation of a transmitter within a region. By knowing the location of the transmitter in the region a geolocation system can determine the angle of arrival of the target signal at any receiving antenna in the region and can determine the distance between the transmitter and the receiving antenna.

Geolocation systems determine the location of a transmitter using two or more antennas at spatially separated antenna sites. Two DF systems can determine the location of a transmitter by finding the intersection of the lines from the DF system at the measured AOA s. Geolocation systems can use time difference of arrival TDOA of signals from the transmitter to the antennas to determine the geolocation of the transmitter. TDOA systems require three or more sites to be highly synchronized in time to less than 10 nsec require a broadband network to transfer signals to a central processor produce large errors when the main signal is blocked by a building or something else and produce very large errors if the transmitter is not within the triangle defined by the three sites.

DF systems in general are simpler and less expensive than geolocation systems. DF systems are of two main types phase comparison and amplitude comparison.

In phase comparison DF systems two or more antennas are configured so that the relative phases of the antenna outputs are unique. The angle of arrival is computed by analyzing the relative phases of the antenna outputs. Interferometer systems are examples of phase comparison DF systems. Interferometer systems have relatively high angle of arrival AOA measurement accuracy 1 3 but their costs are high and extensive phase calibration is required. The interferometer systems must be thermally calibrated or compensated and multiple antennas are needed for each band to resolve ambiguities. For lower frequencies the antenna arrays can get quite large.

In Watson Watt systems two co located sets of antennas are oriented perpendicularly and the signals from the sets of antennas are subtracted. The bearing angle is computed by taking the arctangent of the ratio of the subtracted signals. The subtraction is done at RF and requires the phase of the two antennas cables and subtraction circuit to be well matched. This operation inherently makes Watson Watt systems phase sensitive. Watson Watt systems are inexpensive and compact with medium AOA accuracy 4 7 however they usually only cover up to 1 GHz.

In amplitude comparison DF systems two or more unique amplitude outputs are obtained from one or more directional antennas positioned at different angles. The angle of arrival is computed by analyzing the relative amplitudes of these outputs.

The antennas in DF systems are connected to one or more radio receivers. The radio receivers have various configurations including single channel and multi channel radio receivers. The antenna systems include for example configurations such as i a single channel receiver connected to a single antenna ii a single channel receiver connected to multiple antennas and iii a multi channel receiver connected to multiple antennas.

In one example of an amplitude comparison DF system a single antenna for receiving the transmitter signal is attached to a rotating pedestal and is connected to a single channel receiver. The angle of arrival of the transmitter signal is determined as the pedestal angle where the received signal is strongest.

In another example of an amplitude comparison DF system a multi antenna array is connected to one or more receivers for receiving the transmitter signal. The power levels of the signals received by the different directional antennas are used to determine the angle of arrival of the transmitter signal. With well selected antennas the power levels of the received signals at the strongest two adjacent antennas in a multi array of antennas are unique for determining the angle of arrival of the signal.

The multi antenna array systems using amplitude comparison of the power level have the following advantages over other DF systems no phase calibration stability requirements no precise timing requirements inexpensive one set of antennas can cover a wide frequency range simple power calibration the package containing the system can be light weight and compact insensitivity to aging and thermal issues since these effects tend to be common mode to all antennas and hence are cancelled in the Power calculations.

The multi antenna array systems using amplitude comparison of the power values have the disadvantages of low accuracy and high sensitivity to RF local field amplitude variations caused by multipath and other problems.

Some direction finding systems are mobile and are located on vehicles. As the vehicles move the systems calculate the angle of arrival of received signals. To do so the angle of arrival outlier measurements are discarded and the rest of the measurements are processed to calculate a weighted mean angle of arrival. Some direction finding systems are stationary and operate to determine the angle of arrival of a stationary transmitter.

While many amplitude comparison DF systems have been employed the systems suffer from poor accuracy or high sensitivity to multipath interference and non ideal antenna and system characteristics. Many of these problems cannot be corrected by calibration. While such amplitude comparison DF systems are inexpensive compact and relatively free from thermal and phase problems they generally have low AOA accuracy 10 15 where higher AOA accuracy of from 1 3 is needed.

In consideration of the above background there is a need for improved multi antenna array amplitude comparison DF systems with higher accuracy and with reduced sensitivity to problems which cannot be corrected with calibration.

The present invention is a direction finding system for finding the angle of arrival of a target signal from a transmitter. The system includes a plurality of directional antennas positioned to face different directions for receiving the target signal. The antennas are mounted as an antenna array on a rotatable mount for supporting and rotating the antenna array. A receiver unit connects to the directional antennas and down converts the radio frequency signals to intermediate frequency IF signals that are digitized by an A D converter providing digital values representing the target signal. A computer computes the power in the signals of interest from the A D samples. A computer stores calibration information for the directional antennas processes the digital values and the calibration information to determine a rotation angle for rotating the antennas to provide new digital values processes the new digital values and the calibration information to determine an intersection angle and subtracts the rotation angle from the intersection angle to determine the final value for the angle of arrival of the target signal.

The direction finding system uses calibration information which is PowerCal values determined for a pair of adjacent antennas and the measured digital values are processed to form Power values for the pair of adjacent antennas.

The direction finding system determines the rotation angle as an angle where the PowerCal values are free of ambiguities and exhibit a long steep and smooth slope.

In one embodiment of the direction finding system the computer executes the processing steps of determining if an ambiguity exists in the digital power value and upon detecting the ambiguity commands the rotatable mount to rotate an increment angle. The computer repeats the determining step for one or more increment angles until the PowerCal values are in a region free of ambiguities.

In one embodiment of the direction finding system the receiver unit includes one or more receivers that connect to the directional antennas through a switch. The switch connects different ones of the directional antennas to the receiver at different times whereby the receiver processes the outputs from the connected ones of the directional antennas.

The direction finding system includes an antenna array unit supporting the plurality of directional antennas positioned to face different directions for receiving the target signal includes a rotatable mount for supporting and rotating the antenna array unit includes a receiver unit having one or more receivers for down converting the radio frequency signal to an intermediate frequency IF that is digitized by the A D converter. A computer computes the power in the signal of interest form the digital power values from the A D samples. A computer stores calibration information for the directional antennas as a function of angular direction and provides PowerCal calibration data values for a pair of the antennas. The computer provides Power measured data values for the received signals from the pair of antennas for the target signal compares the Power measured data values with the PowerCal calibration data values to determine a rotation angle for rotating the antenna array unit provides new Power measured data values for the received data values from the pair of antennas for the target signal at the rotation angle location interpolates the PowerCal values to determine the intersection angle where the new Power data values intersect the PowerCal calibration data values and subtracts the rotation angle from the intersection angle to determine the final value for the angle of arrival of the target signal.

The foregoing and other objects features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description made in conjunction with the drawings.

In a block diagram representation of a direction finding system is shown including a multi antenna array unit a radio receiver unit and a computer . The direction finding system operates to detect the angle of arrival AOA of received radio frequency RF signals called target signals from a transmitter with an unknown bearing. In the embodiment of the antenna array unit includes N directional antennas . . . . . . N 1 N. In typical embodiments the number N can be any integer value equal to two or more. In one embodiment the antennas are broadband spiral antennas. Broadband spiral antennas are selected because they a work well with horizontal and vertical polarization b have roughly constant antenna beam width over a wide range of frequencies c are small flat and light weight and d have good antenna gain 6 dB . To cover a wider range of frequencies multiple sets of antennas can be used. For example 8 inch diameter antennas are used to cover 0.5 6 GHz and 2 inch spirals are used to cover 4 18 GHz. Spiral antennas that cover lower frequencies get large as the wavelength gets larger. To go down to 150 MHz the selected spirals are about 30 inches in diameter making the array diameter about 55 inches.

The antenna array unit includes a rotatable table which enables the azimuth angle of the antennas . . . N to be selected for each target signal. The multi antenna array unit connects to a radio receiver unit . The radio receiver unit includes one or more receivers including the receivers . . . R where R is any integer equal to or less than N. The R receivers receive N signals from N antennas. When R is equal to N there is a receiver for each antenna. When R is less than N two or more antennas share the same receiver. When R is equal to one all antennas share the same receiver.

The connect unit in the antenna array unit selects the particular one or ones of the antennas to be connected to the receiver unit at any particular time. If the number of antennas equals the number of receivers that is R equals N then connector unit is an N channel cable. If the number of antennas is less than the number of receivers that is R less than N then connect unit includes a switch for switching receivers among antennas.

The received target signals down converted by the receiver are processed in the IF processing unit . The IF processing unit has both analog and digital embodiments. In analog embodiments processing unit includes for example analog filters and analog power meters for determining power values of the IF signals which are input to computer . In digital embodiments processing unit includes one or more A D converters and the converted signals are connected to the computer . In one embodiment multiple A D converters are provided one for each of the receivers . In other embodiments one or more A D converters are shared among multiple receivers.

With received antenna signals that are fairly constant over the measurement period a switch and single receiver will provide good AOA measurements. This measurement period usually takes 1 100 msec depending on the signal integration desired. If the received signals are short such as radar pulses switching between antennas is a fairly poor technique as each antenna will have different pulses. If the signal transmitter is a rotating antenna radar AOA errors will occur. Using multiple receivers to simultaneously measure the power in the same pulse eliminates this problem.

The connector unit in the antenna array unit selects by direct connection in a cable or through a switch for switching the particular one or ones of the antennas to be connected to the receiver unit at any particular time. The received target signals detected by the receivers are processed in the IF processing unit and are connected to the computer . The computer is typically a standard microprocessor that operates to control all of the subsystems and communicate with the user. In some embodiments the computer includes a field programmable gate array FPGA to perform functions such as switch control and signal processing that need to be done quickly. The computer processes the converted signals to calculate the signal power values for angle of arrival determination. To calculate the signal power values the computer filters off all signal energy not in the prescribed bandwidth of the signal of interest. The signal power values are the total signal power in the signal bandwidth. The filtering can be done with digital filtering or an FFT. The computer also connects to rotatable table the switch and the receiver for controlling the timing and selection of the antennas to be connected to the receiving unit and for controlling the processing of data received. The receivers are controlled by the computer subsystems to set the center frequency bandwidth and gain to down convert the signals of interest. When the system is commanded to take a recording it records a short burst from each of the antennas to determine the signal level. Then longer recordings are made switching through each of the antennas with the gain of the receiver set to the level to optimize the A D input level and keep the SNR as high as possible. These recordings are used to determine the power level for the AOA algorithms. The direction finding system operates to detect the angle of arrival of received radio frequency target signals using an amplitude comparison algorithm. The power levels of the target signals received by the different antennas . . . N are used to determine the angle of arrival. A pair of the adjacent ones of the antennas . . . N is selected for any particular received target signal where the pair is the two adjacent antennas with the strongest received signal levels for the target signal. If the RF power of the signal changes in the time it takes to record the signal from two adjacent signals AOA errors will result. The switch should be switched between adjacent antennas as fast as possible to minimize the change in received signal strength. In one embodiment for high speed the switching of the switch is performed in a high speed FPGA under control of the system computer . The FPGA is used to do fast switching to minimize the chance that the target signal changed power between consecutive switch positions.

In a block diagram representation of a direction finding system is shown including a 6 antenna array unit with a radio receiver unit . The direction finding system operates to detect the angle of arrival AOA of received radio frequency RF signals called target signals . In the embodiment of the antenna array unit includes six directional antennas . . . . The antennas are typically identical but can be different. The antennas form a 6 antenna array unit where the antennas are arrayed at 60 intervals to cover a 360 angular range for receiving target signals. In a single receiver embodiment for the radio receiver unit includes a single receiver that receives signals from the antennas . . . one at a time through operation of switch . The received target signals detected by the receivers are A D converted in the A D converter unit and the converted signals are connected to the computer . The computer processes the converted signals to calculate the power in the signal of interest for angle of arrival determination.

In the block diagram representation of the physical signal path extends from the antenna through receiver and A D converter to the computer . The signal spectrum into the receiver is at RF frequencies. The signal spectrum output from the receiver and input to the A D converter is at IF frequencies. The A D converter digitizes the IF signal producing at its output a digital time waveform representation of the IF signal.

In a block diagram representation of the computer signal processing steps for one embodiment for determining signal power values includes a multiply by window function an FFT function and a sum function . The multiply by window function processes the A D samples to feed the FFT the weighted output consists of real data samples. The FFT function processes the real data and produces outputs in bins in the form of complex data having I and Q components. The sum function forms the sum over the FFT bins containing the signal of interest. The sum is the square of the I and Q components I Q which produces the signal power for the signal of interest.

In a representation is shown of the signal spectrum of the SIGNAL OF INTEREST as isolated by FFT processing.

In a block diagram representation of the direction finding system is shown with the multi antenna array unit shown in a perspective view. In the antenna array unit includes six directional antennas . . . . In one embodiment each of the antennas is an eight inch broadband spiral antenna. The switch in the antenna array unit selects the particular one or ones of the antennas . . . to be connected to the receiver unit at any particular time. In alternate embodiments the receiver unit has two receivers one for the two strongest antenna signals or has six receivers one for each of six antennas . The received signals detected by the receiver unit are A D converted in the A D converter UNIT and the converted signals are connected to the computer . The computer processes and stores the signal power values for angle of arrival determination. The computer also connects to rotatable table the switch and the receiver for controlling the timing and selection of the antennas to be connected to the receiving unit and for controlling the processing of data received.

In a schematic view of antenna patterns and from the pair of antennas and of the multi antenna array unit of and are shown. A received RF target signal from a transmitter is shown. The angle of arrival of the RF signal from transmitter in the example of is between 180 and 240 measured relative to the reference direction . Of course the angle of arrival can be any value from 0 to 360 . The pair of antennas selected from the multi antenna array unit is determined as the pair of antennas having the strongest signals. Since the antennas . . . are directional the pair of antennas and together are likely to have the strongest signals for a target signal having an angle of arrival between 180 and 240 . The antennas and are the selected pair for purposes of the example with a target signal having an angle of arrival of 199.6 . If the angle of arrival were between 0 and 60 60 and 120 120 and 180 240 and 300 or 300 and 360 then the selected pairs likely would be antennas and and and and and and respectively.

In the received power level for the antenna is designated with a solid circle at the intersection of the received signal and the array pattern Received Power . The received power level for the antenna is designated with a solid circle at the intersection of the received signal and the array pattern Received Power .

In the multi antenna array unit of and is shown at the reference orientation with the plane of the antenna A1 normal to the reference direction as described in connection with . The antennas and are the selected pair of antennas for purposes of the and example where the angle of arrival of the RF target signal is between 180 and 240 . In the particular example described 199.6 . In the selected pair of antennas and each detects the target signal and produces target signal power values used to determine the angle of rotation required for the antenna array unit in order to provide an accurate angle of arrival determination. The angel of rotation can be positive or negative that is or .

In the multi antenna array unit of and is shown at a rotation angle orientation. The rotation angle orientation resulted by rotating the antenna array unit clockwise relative to the reference orientation of . In the selected pair of antennas and each detects the target signal and produces target signal power values used to determine the angle of rotation according to the angle of arrival algorithm processing.

The angle of arrival algorithm encompasses a number of processes. The angle of arrival algorithm requires calibration of each of the antennas in the antenna array unit . For each antenna array unit a calibration table of received calibration power levels is formed for each antenna in response to a transmitted calibration signal. The transmitted calibration signal is transmitted to cover the full angular range from 0 to 360 . In order to cover the full angular range from 0 to 360 each antenna is positioned relative to the direction of the calibration signal at each one of a number of calibration angles called angle calibration steps. In one embodiment the angle calibration steps are 2 apart so that there are 180 angle calibration steps required to cover the full 360 . The power measurements are made at each calibration step angle for each antenna and for each frequency over a frequency operation range. The frequency operation range is covered by frequency steps that typically range from 1 MHz steps to 50 MHz steps. The completed calibration table includes for each antenna a received calibration power level at each angle step for each frequency step.

In order to determine the angle of arrival of a target signal the first step is to determine the power levels received in each of the N antennas six antennas in the embodiment of and in response to receiving the target signal. The two adjacent antennas having the highest power levels are selected as the antenna pair for further processing and are named Antenna and Antenna .

Since any particular target signal to be processed to determine its angle of arrival may have a frequency that is in between the frequency step entries in the calibration table interpolation methods are employed to improve accuracy. The result of such interpolation is referred to as an interpolated calibration table and or as interpolated calibration data.

The initial processing determines the approximate frequency of a received target signal that is determines the target signal frequency. Assuming that the target signal frequency is not precisely one of the step frequencies in the calibration table but falls between step frequencies the calibration table is interpolated to provide interpolated calibration power levels at each of the step angles for each antenna in the antenna pair.

The interpolated calibration data for each antenna of the antenna pair has variations which may evidence for example ripple regions shallow slope regions and longer and steeper smooth slope regions. The regions are observable visually when plotted in a Power versus Angle graph but the regions are intrinsically present in the data whether graphed or not.

After forming the interpolated calibration power levels for each antenna the calibrated power difference values PowerCal are calculated by subtracting the ANTENNA 2 power values from the ANTENNA 1 values. The PowerCal values thus calculated will also typically evidence ripple regions shallow slope regions and longer and steeper smooth slope regions that vary as a function of angle. The calibrated power difference values PowerCal are processed to find a good region for further analysis. The good region selected is typically the longest region having a steeper smooth slope. The ends of the good region have power values that are away from the ambiguities caused by the ripples. Power buffer regions of 3 6 dB are typically used. The good region also has a frequency guard band to keep away from regions where the slope is shallow. A typical guard band is 2 MHz. These guard bands ensure that a noise or modulation on the signal does not cause enough of a power error to take the signal into ambiguous or high error angles. For the good region selected the maximum PowerCal PowerCal and the minimum PowerCal PowerCal are determined. These calibration values PowerCaland PowerCalare used to determine an appropriate angle and direction for rotating the antenna array unit for accurate angle of arrival determination.

After processing the calibration data to determine the calibration values PowerCaland PowerCalvalues the measured power levels for the target signal are processed. For the target signal the power difference values Power are calculated by subtracting the ANTENNA 2 power values from the ANTENNA 1 values for the target signal.

A determination is made as to whether the measured Power Power for the received target signal is greater than the calibration PowerCaland if greater the antenna array unit is rotated clockwise an angle until the measured Power Power is less than PowerCal. After such a rotation angle the received target signal is operating in the good region.

Also a determination is made as to whether the measured Power Power for the received target signal is less than the calibration PowerCaland if less the antenna array unit is rotated counter clockwise an angle until the measured Power Power is greater than PowerCal. After such a rotation angle the received target signal is operating in the good region.

After the antenna array unit has been rotated by the rotation angle or the PowerCal data is interpolated to determine the new measured angle of arrival. The new measured angle of arrival is the angle where the Powervalue intersects the PowerCal data.

After determining the new measured angle of arrival the rotation angle or is subtracted from the new measured angle of arrival to find the true angle of arrival.

In a plot of Power dB vs. Angle deg of Antenna is designated as curve and of Antenna is designated as curve . The curves and have smooth polynomial shapes and are idealized representations of antenna power levels detected by Antenna and Antenna from a calibration signal. Antenna and Antenna represent for example antenna A4 and antenna A5 respectively as depicted in . The curve in is a plot of the PowerCal versus Angle curve formed by subtracting the data values represented by curve from the data values represented by curve over an angular range from about 100 to 300 degrees.

While the antenna patterns for curves and of are smooth and monotonically decreasing from the center point such ideal patterns are not representative of most antennas. Unfortunately at most frequencies the antenna patterns in an array of antennas have ripple resulting in angle of arrival ambiguities.

In a plot of calibration data for two antennas is shown for a 2.42 GHz signal. Antenna is designated as having calibration curve and Antenna is designated as having calibration curve . Curve is determined as the PowerCal values by subtracting the curve values from the curve values over the range from about 100 to 300 . The calibration data represented by curve is used for determining the angle of arrival AOA of a target signal having a 2.42 GHz frequency. By way of example it is assumed that a target signal has measured values of power such that the difference of measured power between antenna and antenna is 9 dB that is Power 9.0 dB. For Power 9.0 dB the calibration data represented by curve in has seven angle of arrival ambiguities as indicated by the ripple in curve crossing the horizontal line designating the Power 9.0 dB value seven times.

In order to remove the angle of arrival ambiguities described in connection with processing of the calibration data and repositioning of the directional antennas is carried out. The antenna array unit and each of the antennas . . . are calibrated and the calibration values for each antenna are stored as calibration data in a calibration table. The calibration table contains the received power over 360 degrees of azimuth for all antennas at the frequencies of interest. In one embodiment the 360 degrees are covered using 2 degree azimuth steps. Of course smaller or larger steps can be used for higher or lower resolution. The frequency resolution is determined by the rate of change of the pattern over frequency for the frequencies of interest. In some bands as low as 1 MHz steps are used. In well behaved frequencies or low priority frequencies the calibration uses 50 MHz steps for example.

The table is compiled by putting the antenna array on a rotary stage and receiving the known signal transmitted by a local antenna. The power is measured for each antenna at each frequency and angle. The calibration can be done in an anechoic chamber an antenna range or in the deployment site.

An example of a calibration table segment at one frequency for an array with six antennas is shown in the following TABLE 1. Similar tables are generated for all frequencies of interest.

In plots of Received Power Differences PowerCal versus Angle for two pairs of antennas are shown over an angular range from 20 to 140 degrees for a 2340 MHz signal. The antenna system is the antenna array unit with the six antennas . . . . Each adjacent pair of the antennas . . . is used to cover approximately 70 degrees. More explicitly the antennas A1 and A2 cover 5 to 65 the antennas A2 and A3 cover 55 to 125 the antennas A3 and A4 cover 115 to 185 the antennas A4 and A5 cover 175 to 245 the antennas A5 and A6 cover 235 to 305 and the antennas A5 and A6 cover 295 to 5 .

In the curve represents the PowerCal difference between the A1 antenna and the A2 antenna values over the range from approximately 20 to 140 and the curve represents the difference values between the A2 antenna and the A3 antenna signals over the range from approximately 20 to 140 .

With the PowerCal difference calibration curves and of the good angles are identified. The useful ranges which contain the good angles are the portions of the curves and that are monotonic and are away from ambiguities or shallow slope regions. These useful good ranges are shown by the rectangles formed with dashed lines in . More particularly for the curve one useful range GOOD REGION 1 is from approximately 20 to 36 . For the curve one useful range GOOD REGION 2 is from approximately 80 to 95 . If no good region is found the system will check the calibration tables for other antenna in the array to see if rotating to different antennas will have good regions. For example if Antenna and Antenna don t have a good region perhaps Antenna and Antenna or Antenna and Antenna will have a good region. If the system does not have a good region at the given frequency the AOA is measured and reported to the user with an indication that the measurement likely has large errors. In actual testing 200 frequencies were checked and good regions of at least 6 degrees in width existed for every antenna pair.

In an expanded plot of Received Power Difference PowerCal versus Angle for the difference between the A1 and A2 antenna data values is shown as represented by curve in . The expanded angular range in is from 20 to 80 degrees. In that expanded range the GOOD REGION 1 extends from about 20 to 36 . The GOOD REGION 1 is the same as identified in . The GOOD REGION 1 includes regions before approximately 20 and after approximately 36 that appear noise free and hence act as guard bands around the GOOD REGION 1.

In a plot of the calibration Received Power Difference PowerCal versus Angle for the difference between the A1 and A2 antenna signals is shown as represented by curve over an angular range from 10 to 40 degrees for a 2340 MHz signal. A test RF signal to be measured for angle of arrival is originally detected with a Received Power value of approximately 4 dB indicating a new angle of arrival between 2 and 3 . Since the new angle of arrival is not within the GOOD REGION 2 the antenna unit of and is rotated a degrees to bring the received test signal within the GOOD REGION 2. The rotation angle is not known when the Power is measured. Due to the ambiguities caused by the ripples shown in there are multiple choices for . The smallest ambiguous value of a is used first to rotate the antenna array. If there are no ambiguities the calibration table is interrogated to determine the best estimate of the angle needed to get in the good region and the array is rotated by this amount. After this rotation Power is measured again. If this is in the good region the AOA is measured. If this is not in the good region the search process is repeated until Power is in the good region. In the example the angle of rotation equals approximately 20 and the measured angle of arrival is 22.5 for a net AOA of 2.5 . If the good region requires a significant rotation angle the calibration tables for the strongest antenna and the other adjacent antenna is checked to see if the good region for that antenna pair requires less rotation in the other direction. The angle of rotation has been observed in some embodiments to be 40 degrees however it is possible to have larger angles of rotation with a 6 antenna array.

If time permits or if higher AOA accuracy is desired the stage can be used to step across the angles in the good region taking multiple AOA measurements. The AOA measurements can be processed to remove outliers. This removal can be as simple as removing the high and low measurements or removing those measurements more outside 2 to 3 sigma from the mean value of the AOA measurements. The AOA measurements can be processed to weight the remaining measurements with the signal s signal to noise ratio SNR and compute the weighted mean of the remaining AOAs.

In a plot of the AOA Error versus Frequency is shown for calibration frequency steps of 5 MHz and of 20 MHz over the frequency range from 2340 MHz to 2400 MHz. It is apparent from that the error when using 20 MHz calibration frequency steps is less than about 5 and the error when using 5 MHz calibration frequency steps is less than about 2.5 . These errors are substantially less than errors that exist when no rotation occurs. Non rotation operation has errors which typically are 15 to 20 . The data for were taken at one angle in the good region. Using multiple angles in the good region reduced the AOA error significantly.

The present invention is implemented with further and other embodiments. For example the algorithms for implementing the antenna rotation include the following embodiments. The signal power is measured in many ways including i filtering the signal to the signal bandwidth and measuring the power with a power meter this operation can be done in analog on the IF signal and reading the resultant power value from a power meter or digitally on the digitized samples ii filtering the signal with a digital tuner and determining the power as the average of I Q from the complex tuner output samples and iii calculating an FFT on the signal and summing the power in all bins in the signal bandwidth as shown in .

If multiple signals are present in the processed bandwidth AOA errors can occur if the two signals have similar AOAs. If they are separated significantly in azimuth angle 120 and have similar power levels within 6 dB the system can measure the AOA on both signals however the AOA s will have somewhat larger errors than with only one signal present. The use of filtering such as a FFT greatly reduces or eliminates the impact of multiple signals at different frequencies. If there are multiple target signals at the same frequency with similar power levels from the same general direction the system is more likely to produce an incorrect AOA. If the multiple target signals come from significantly different directions the system is more likely to produce proper results for the strongest signal.

As still further embodiments various algorithms are used to interpolate the calibration table. For example linear interpolation is used for each angle between calibration table values at frequencies on either side of the signal frequency. Still further a spline fit is determined across more frequencies. Interpolation is done using linear power Watts or log power dBm .

If the antennas are well behaved with a minimum amount of ripple the antenna patterns are fit to polynomials. The use of polynomials calibration table storage space and allows the angle of arrival to be calculated instead of interpolated from the table.

The DF operation is performed with the assistance of computer program operations. A typical computer program for that purpose is listed hereinafter as Appendix 1. The computer program of Appendix 1 includes the subroutines listed in the following TABLE 2 

In TABLE 2 the 1routine DFcode.m executes to perform the DF method with a six element antenna array on rotatable table as shown in and . The execution operates to measure the Angle Of Arrival AOA of a signal which in the example described is at a frequency freq 2420 MHz over interpolated angles for calibration data from 0 to 360 . The antenna calibration data is read from the directory folderCal and is interpolated to return the 6 N table at frequency freq . N is the number of angles in the calibration table typically 180 2 deg increment . The angle data is processed with a spline fit to return the power values at the angles in array ang .

The 1routine DFcode.m calls the subroutines listed in TABLE 2. The subroutines are readCal.m calcPower.m getAntennas.m findGoodCalAngles.m readdPwr.m calcAOAfit.m processAOA.m and getAvgFFT.m. These subroutines are first called at the lines in Appendix 1 listed in the Call Subroutine Line column in TABLE 2. The subroutines begin at the lines in Appendix 1 indicated in the Start Subroutine Line column of TABLE 2.

The 2subroutine readCal.m called at line 2 of APPENDIX 1 starts at line 43 of Appendix 1. The 2subroutine inputs are folder directory with the calibration data files where the file contains only cal files and the header file freq signal frequency to return cal data for the six antennas MHz ang angles to return cal data deg . The 2subroutine output is pCal antenna power . The 2subroutine code executes pCal readCal folderCal freq ang to store the calibration table for frequency freq and ang angles.

The subroutine readADCsamples is another read subroutine and operates analogously to the readCal.m subroutine and for conciseness is not shown in the code of Annex . The receiver is tuned to freq MHz and bandwidth is set by the digital tuner. The decimation factor and read nSam sample values are input to fileOut on disk. The fs value is the sample rate used by the ADC. The readADCsamples subroutine call sets up the configuration freq decimation nSam for future readADC commands.

The 3subroutine calcPower.m called at line 4 of APPENDIX 1 starts at line 93 of Appendix 1. The ADC samples are read from a disk file where the inputs are file file name with the samples from the A D converter fs Sample rate used by the A D converter Msam sec freq Frequency of the signal of interest. The output is pwr dBm signal power dBm . The power for each of the six antennas is calculated and returns the six results in pwr dBm where pwr dBm calcPower folder fileOut fs freq . The 3subroutine calcPower.m calls at line 113 of Appendix 1 the 9subroutine getAvgFFT.m at line 274 of Appendix 1 where freq pwr getAvgFFT y fs nFFT computes and plots the Hanning windowed FFT of data in vector y.

The 4subroutine getAntennas.m called at line 6 of APPENDIX 1 starts at line 130 of Appendix 1 and operates to find the two adjacent antennas with the highest power. The 4subroutine determines the strongest antenna number and then the strongest adjacent antenna. The inputs pwr are the power values from each of the antennas dBm . The outputs are ant1 Antenna number with the highest power and ant2 Antenna number with 2highest power adjacent to ant1.

After finding the ant1 and ant2 in the 4subroutine the Power calibration differences for ant1 and ant2 are formed in line 7 of Appendix 1 dpCal curve dpCal pCal ant1 pCal ant2 and the Power measured signals for ant1 and ant2 are formed in line 8 of Appendix 1 dPwr curve dPwr pwr dBm ant1 pwr dBm ant2 .

In lines 11 through 25 of APPENDIX 1 the antennas are rotated clockwise at line 11 or counterclockwise at line 16 by a rotation angle.

The 6subroutine readdPwr.m called at line 26 of APPENDIX 1 starts at line 253 of Appendix 1 and operates to read the power levels for ant1 and ant2 and form the dPwr difference between the two. The computer system commands the receiver and A D converter to collect data read that data from disk and calculate the dPwr. The A D converter is read using configuration file established earlier with the line 3 of APPENDIX 1 call to readADCsamples . This config file fileDatCmd sets the signal frequency decimation factor bandwidth number of samples to read and which antennas to read. The digitized samples are stored file signal file family. The readADCsamples command appends the antenna number and suffix .dat on each output file name.
