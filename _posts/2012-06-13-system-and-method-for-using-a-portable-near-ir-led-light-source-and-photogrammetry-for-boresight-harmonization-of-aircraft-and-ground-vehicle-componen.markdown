This Application claims rights under 35 USC 119 e from U.S. application Ser. No. 61 498 705 filed Jun. 20 2011 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to sighting systems and more particularly to boresight harmonization and alignment systems.

Typically boresight alignment or harmonization of the mounting provisions of an air vehicle system or a component thereof requires removing the equipment. Upon completing the harmonization the equipment is re installed and the system undergoes a functional check. The harmonization is done with multiple adapters with varying degrees of complexity and expends valuable time and resources in addition to air vehicle down time. The boresight adapters themselves require alignment and calibration typically involving jigs and elaborate calibration setups.

One existing method uses lasers to measure boresight alignment by aiming lasers to a target board having markings attached to a certain location on an aircraft and these techniques are crude and not accurate for determining x y and z positions. Another existing technique uses gyros for boresight alignment. However this method provides the roll pitch and yaw and does not provide the x y and z coordinate positions.

There may be certain disadvantages to the traditional boresight alignment systems. These possible disadvantages may include unstable weapon system targeting accuracy high acquisition and life cycle costs high failure rate regular maintenance or calibration may be required lack of built in test hard to determine cause of failure and corrective action and a large logistic footprint. Current systems may also require a high level of skill and constant training to use. A minimum of two and normally three to five operators are needed and platform systems must often be removed prior to any checks.

Disclosed is a system and method for using a portable near infrared light emitting diode IR LED light source and photogrammetry for boresight harmonization of aircraft and ground vehicle components. In one embodiment the method includes measuring orientation and positional parameters of two or more fixed points and distances between the two or more fixed points using the portable near IR LED light source with a photogrammetric system. The two or more fixed points are reference points within the aircraft or the land vehicle. Measuring the orientation and the positional parameters of the two or more fixed points on the aircraft or the land vehicle includes measuring roll pitch and yaw of the two or more fixed points on the aircraft or the land vehicle. Measuring the distances between the two or more fixed points includes measuring x y and z direction distances between the two or more fixed points on the aircraft or the land vehicle. The orientation and positional parameters and the distances are measured with respect to one two or three axis.

The measured orientation and positional parameters of the two or more fixed points and the distances between the two or more fixed points on the aircraft or the land vehicle are compared with specified design parameters of the component in the aircraft or the land vehicle. The specified design parameters of the component in the aircraft or the land vehicle are predetermined and stored in a database of a computing system. Based on the comparison of an outcome the component in the aircraft is harmonized.

According to one embodiment the portable near IR LED light source is a portable near IR LED pen or a probe having two or more light emitting diodes LEDs . According to another embodiment the portable near IR LED pen includes eight LEDs.
