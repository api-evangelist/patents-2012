The present application is a National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT JP2012 051983 entitled Gamepiece Flicking Toy filed Jan. 30 2012 the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a game piece launching toy used while playing games in which game pieces such as marbles are launched.

A launching toy used while playing games in which spherical bodies such as marbles are launched is disclosed in the following PTL 1. This launching toy includes a toy body a pair of flipping members provided on the toy body and a pushing member that pushes out a spherical body placed between the flipping members. The pair of flipping members correspond to two tip portions that make a pair of circular arc shaped members. The distance between the tips of the flipping members is less than the diameter of the spherical body.

A user first places the spherical body between the flipping members and moves the spherical body toward the tips of the flipping member using the pushing member while holding down the toy body with the hands. In the process in which the spherical body moves toward the tips of the flipping member the distance between the tips of the flipping members is increased against the elastic forces of the tips. If the spherical body is further moved toward the tips of the flipping members the spherical body is eventually launched from between the flipping members by the elastic restoring forces of the flipping members.

In the aforementioned launching toy the force launching the spherical body is almost dependent on the elastic restoring forces of the flipping members. Therefore the force launching the spherical body from the toy body is approximately constant and the speed of the spherical body launched from the toy body is also approximately constant.

A game piece launching toy of the invention includes a toy body a flipping member installed on the toy body a pushing member configured to move a game piece placed on the toy body toward a tip of the flipping member and a restriction member installed on the toy body to be movable with respect to the toy body and operated by a user to restrict the flipping member. The game piece loaded into the toy body is launched from the toy body by a restriction force acting on the flipping member.

A user first loads the game piece used for play into the toy body operates the restriction member while holding down the toy body with the hands and restricts the tip of the flipping member. Then the game piece is moved toward the tip of the flipping member using the pushing member. Meanwhile since the tip of the flipping member is restricted by the user s hands via the restriction member a force checking the movement of the game piece using the pushing member is generated. If the game piece is further moved toward the tip of the flipping member against this force the tip of the flipping member is displaced against a restriction force generated by the user s hands. Then if the center of the game piece moves further forward than a contact point between the flipping member and the game piece the game piece is launched from the toy body by the restriction force acting on the flipping member by the user s hands.

In the invention the toy body may be provided with a pair of the flipping members and only one flipping member may be provided on the toy body. When the pair of flipping members are provided the restriction member restricts the pair of the flipping members so as to make the distance between tips of the flipping members less than the breadth of the game piece. For example if a spherical body is used as the game piece a restriction member restricts the flipping member so as to make the distance between the tips of the flipping member less than the diameter of the spherical body.

When only one flipping member is provided on the toy body the restriction member restricts the tip of the flipping member so as to make the spacing between the toy body having the game piece placed thereon and the tip of the flipping member less than the breadth of the game piece.

According to the invention when a user operates the restriction member while holding down the game piece launching toy with their hands the restriction force acting on the flipping member can be adjusted by adjusting the force input to the restriction member by the user s hands. Accordingly since the user can arbitrarily adjust the force launching the game piece from the toy body changes can be made to the speed of the game piece to be launched from the toy body. As a result the range of play using the game piece launching toy is broad and the user s enjoyment is enhanced.

A first embodiment of a game piece launching toy of the invention which is shown in to will be described below.

As shown in the first embodiment of the invention includes a toy body that for example imitates a character of an animation a pair of flipping members and that launches a spherical body B as a game piece used for play a pushing member that pushes the spherical body B loaded into the toy body and restriction members L and R that restrict tips of the flipping members and respectively. All of the flipping members and the pushing member and the restriction members L and R are attached to the toy body .

The toy body can be disassembled into several parts including a base . As shown in the base is formed with a launching port of the spherical body B. The flipping members and are respectively disposed on both sides of the launching port

The flipping member is pivotally supported within an imaginary horizontal plane by a pin L fixed to the base on the left side of the launching port in a direction in which the spherical body B is launched that is in the launching direction of the spherical body B. The flipping member is formed so that the width thereof increases gradually from a base end toward a tip and the width thereof decreases gradually from a vertex toward the tip . The vertex corresponds to the tip of a corner of the flipping member that projects toward the launching port . Both a rear oblique side extending from the base end toward the vertex and a front oblique side extending from the vertex toward the tip are linearly formed.

The flipping member is pivotally supported within the same imaginary horizontal plane as the flipping member by a pin R fixed to the base on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B. The flipping member is formed so that the width thereof increases gradually from a base end toward a tip and the width thereof decreases gradually from a vertex toward the tip . The vertex corresponds to the tip of a corner of the flipping member that projects toward the launching port . Both a rear oblique side extending from the base end toward the vertex and a front oblique side extending from the vertex toward the tip are linearly formed.

The flipping members and are arranged symmetrically with respect to a centerline Lc of the base along the launching direction of the spherical body B. An imaginary straight line L connecting the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member is always orthogonal to the centerline Lc under the condition that the angle of the flipping member to the centerline Lc is equal to the angle of the flipping member to the centerline Lc.

Additionally the spacing between the pins L and R is clearly wider than the diameter of the spherical body B and the spherical body B loaded into the toy body is movable along the launching port between the flipping members and supported by the pins L and R respectively.

The pushing member is supported by a rear portion of the base with respect to the launching port so as to be insertable in the launching direction of the spherical body B. If the pushing member is inserted into the toy body a tip of the pushing member projects into the launching port abuts against the spherical body B loaded into the launching port and causes the spherical body B to move toward the tips of the flipping members and .

A spring is built in the pushing member . A spring is compressed between the base and the pushing member by inserting the pushing member into the toy body so as to move the spherical body B toward the tips of the flipping members and . When the restriction on the pushing member is released the spring releases the elasticity accumulated by the compression and returns the pushing member to its initial position.

The restriction member L is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the base so as to be movable in a direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. If the restriction member L is pushed into the toy body from a side thereof a tip of the restriction member L abuts against an outer edge of the flipping member and a tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The restriction member R is disposed on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the base so as to be movable in a direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. If the restriction member R is pushed into the toy body from a side thereof a tip of the restriction member R abuts against an outer edge of the flipping member and a tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The restriction members L and R are arranged on both sides of the toy body across the launching port and a direction in which the restriction member L is pushed and a direction in which the restriction member R is pushed are opposite to each other. If the restriction members L and R are simultaneously operated such that the toy body is held with the hands the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member approach each other. The flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First a user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on a base plane. Then flipping members and are restricted by operating the restriction members L and R so as to be pushed into the toy body from both sides of the toy body while holding down the toy body with the hands. Accordingly the distance between the vertexes and becomes less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

Subsequently the spherical body B loaded into the launching port is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member . The spherical body B is pushed by the pushing member is moved forward in the launching direction on the launching port and abuts against the rear oblique side of the flipping member and the rear oblique side of the flipping member . Meanwhile since the flipping members and are restricted by the user s hands via the restriction members L and R forces checking the movement of the spherical body B using the pushing member act on the flipping members and . If the spherical body B is further moved toward the tips of the flipping members and against these forces since the spherical body B abuts against the rear oblique sides and of the flipping members and the tip portions of the flipping members and are displaced against the restriction forces generated by the user s hands so as to widen the distance between the vertexes and . Then if the center of the spherical body B moves forward further than the imaginary straight line L connecting the vertex and the vertex the spherical body B abuts against the front oblique sides and of the flipping members and and is launched forward in the launching direction from the toy body by the restriction forces acting on the flipping members and by the user s hands.

To describe the mechanism in which the spherical body B is launched in more detail as shown in first forces acting on the spherical body B via the rear oblique sides and from the flipping members and are decomposed into components that push the spherical body B against each other in the directions orthogonal to the centerline Lc and components that push the spherical body B backward in the launching direction to a state in which the spherical body B abuts against the rear oblique sides and of the flipping members and . The total of the components that push the spherical body B backward in the launching direction is equivalent to the forces checking the movement of the spherical body B using the pushing member .

As shown in if the spherical body B passes through the vertexes and of the flipping members and and abuts against the front oblique sides and forces acting on the spherical body B via the front oblique sides and from the flipping members and are decomposed into components that push the spherical body B in the directions orthogonal to the centerline Lc and components that push the spherical body B forward in the launching direction. The total of the components that push the spherical body B forward in the launching direction is equivalent to a force launching the spherical body B from the toy body .

According to the game piece launching toy configured as mentioned above when a user operates the restriction members L and R while holding down the game piece launching toy with the hands the restriction forces acting on the flipping members and can be adjusted by adjusting the forces input to the restriction members L and R by the user s hands. That is if the user holds down the game piece launching toy strongly with the hands the restriction members L and R are also operated with strong forces. Thus the restriction forces acting on the flipping members and also become strong. Therefore the forces pushing the spherical body B forward in the launching direction via the flipping members and also become strong and consequently the spherical body B can be quickly launched from the toy body .

In contrast if the forces with which the user holds down the game piece launching toy are weakened the forces operating the restriction members L and R also become weaker. Thus the restriction forces acting on the flipping members and also become weaker. Therefore the forces pushing the spherical body B forward in the launching direction via the flipping members and also become weaker and consequently the spherical body B can be slowly launched from the toy body . In this way since the user can arbitrarily adjust the force launching the spherical body B from the toy body changes can be made to the speed of the spherical body B to be launched from the toy body . As a result the range of play using the game piece launching toy is broad and the user s enjoyment is enhanced.

In the first embodiment of the game piece launching toy of the invention several modifications are present as follows. These modifications will be described below. In addition the constituent elements already described in the first embodiment will be designated by the same reference numerals and a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

As shown in a first modification of the first embodiment includes restriction members L and R and intermediate portions L and R.

The restriction member L is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by an upper member fixed on the base so as to be movable in the direction that is the vertical direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. A lower portion of the restriction member L is formed with a downward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes downward.

The intermediate portion L is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward the lower portion of the restriction member L. A side portion of the intermediate portion L that abuts against the slope of the restriction member L is formed with an upward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes downward. If the restriction member L is pushed into the toy body from the top the slope of the restriction member L abuts against the slope of the intermediate portion L and downward movement of the restriction member L is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion L thereat via the slopes and that abut against each other. Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The restriction member R is disposed on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the upper member so as to be movable in the direction that is the vertical direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. A lower portion of the restriction member R is formed with a downward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes downward.

The intermediate portion R is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward the lower portion of the restriction member R. A side portion of the intermediate portion R that abuts against the slope of the restriction member R is formed with an upward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes downward. If the restriction member R is pushed into the toy body from the top the slope of the restriction member R abuts against the slope of the intermediate portion R and downward movement of the restriction member R is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion R thereat via the slopes and that abut against each other. Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The restriction members L and R are arranged on both sides of the toy body across the launching port and a direction in which the restriction member L is pushed and a direction in which the restriction member R is pushed coincide with each other. Therefore it is easy to simultaneously operate the restriction members L and R. If the restriction members L and R are simultaneously operated the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member approach each other. The flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then the flipping members and are restricted by operating the restriction members L and R so as to be pushed into the toy body from the top while holding down the toy body with the hands. Subsequently the spherical body B is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

As shown in a second modification of the first embodiment includes levers restriction members in the invention L and R and intermediate portions L and R.

The lever L is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is pivotally supported within the imaginary horizontal plane by a pin L to the base

The intermediate portion L is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward one end of the lever L. A side portion of the intermediate portion L is formed with a backward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes forward in the launching direction of the spherical body B. One end of the lever L near the pin L abuts against the slope . If the other end of the lever L is operated so as to be pulled backward one end of the lever L pushes the slope of the intermediate portion L. That is the rotation of the lever L is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion L formed thereat via one end of the lever L and the slope . Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The lever R is disposed on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is pivotally supported within the imaginary horizontal plane by a pin R to the base

The intermediate portion R is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward one end of the lever R. A side portion of the intermediate portion R is formed with a backward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes forward in the launching direction of the spherical body B. One end of the lever R near the pin R abuts against the slope . If the other end of the lever R is operated so as to be pulled backward one end of the lever R pushes the slope of the intermediate portion R. That is the rotation of the lever R is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion R formed thereat via one end of the lever R and the slope . Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The levers L and R are arranged on both sides of the toy body across the launching port and a direction in which the other end of the lever L is pulled and a direction in which the other end of the lever R is pulled coincide with each other. Therefore it is easy to simultaneously operate the levers L and R. If the levers L and R are simultaneously operated the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member approach each other. The flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then the flipping members and are restricted by operating the other ends of the levers L and R so as to be pulled backward while holding down the toy body with the hands. Subsequently the spherical body B loaded into the launching port is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

As shown in a third modification of the first embodiment includes levers L and R and intermediate portions L and R.

The lever L is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is pivotally supported within an imaginary vertical plane by a pin L to the base

The intermediate portion L is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward one end of the lever L near the pin L. A side portion of the intermediate portion L is formed with a downward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes upward. One end of the lever L abuts against the slope . If the other end of the lever L is operated so as to be toppled downward one end of the lever L pushes the slope of the intermediate portion L. That is the rotation of the lever L is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion L formed thereat via one end of the lever L and the slope . Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The lever R is disposed on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is pivotally supported within the imaginary horizontal plane by a pin R to the base

The intermediate portion R is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward one end of the lever R near the pin R. A side portion of the intermediate portion R is formed with a downward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes upward. One end of the lever R abuts against the slope . If the other end of the lever R is operated so as to be toppled downward one end of the lever R pushes the slope of the intermediate portion R. That is the rotation of the lever R is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion R formed thereat via one end of the lever R and the slope . Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The levers L and R are arranged on both sides of the toy body across the launching port and a direction in which the lever L is toppled and a direction in which the lever R is toppled coincide with each other. Therefore it is easy to simultaneously operate the levers L and R. If the levers L and R are simultaneously operated the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member approach each other. The flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then the flipping members and are restricted by operating the other ends of the levers L and R so as to be toppled downward while holding down the toy body with the hands. Subsequently the spherical body B loaded into the launching port is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

As shown in a fourth modification of the first embodiment includes levers L and R and intermediate portions L and R.

The lever L is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is pivotally supported within the imaginary vertical plane by a pin L to the base

The intermediate portion L is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward one end of the lever L near the pin L. A side portion of the intermediate portion L is formed with an upward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes downward. One end of the lever L abuts against the slope . The other end of the lever L is formed so as to be bent downward. If the other end of the lever L is operated so as to be toppled upward one end of the lever L pushes the slope of the intermediate portion L. That is the rotation of the lever L is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion L formed thereat via one end of the lever L and the slope . Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The lever R is disposed on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is pivotally supported within the imaginary horizontal plane by a pin R to the base

The intermediate portion R is formed integrally with the flipping member and projects toward one end of the lever R near the pin R. A side portion of the intermediate portion R is formed with an upward slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes downward. One end of the lever R abuts against the slope . The other end of the lever R is formed so as to be bent downward. If the other end of the lever R is operated so as to be topped upward one end of the lever R pushes the slope of the intermediate portion R and the rotation of the lever R is converted into lateral movement of the flipping member having the intermediate portion R formed thereat via one end of the lever R and the slope . Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

Since the levers L and R are arranged on both sides of the toy body across the launching port if the levers L and R are simultaneously operated the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member approach each other. The flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then if the toy body is held down with the hands the other ends of the levers L and R that are bent downward abut against the base plane and the levers L and R are rotated upward by reaction forces acting on the levers L and R from the base plane. This restricts the flipping members and . Subsequently the spherical body B loaded into the launching port is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

Particularly according to this fourth modification the flipping members and are restricted simply by holding down the toy body placed on the base plane with the hands. Thus it is possible to operate the game piece launching toy even with a single hand.

As shown in a fifth modification of the first embodiment includes tab members restriction members in the invention L and R and intermediate portions L and R.

The tab member L is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the base so as to be slidable in a direction that is the lateral direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. One end of the tab member L projects from the toy body . The other end of the tab member L is formed with a rack

The intermediate portion L is formed integrally with the flipping member so as to become parallel to the tab member L. A rack is formed at the intermediate portion L so as to face the rack . A pinion gear engaged with the racks and is pivotally supported to the base . If the other end of the tab member L is operated so as to be pulled out from the toy body displacement of the tab member L is transmitted to the intermediate portion L via the rack the pinion gear and the rack and is converted into a movement in the lateral direction of the flipping member having the intermediate portion L formed thereat that is in a direction opposite to the tab member L. Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

The tab member R is disposed on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the base so as to be slidable in the direction that is the lateral direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. One end of the tab member R projects from the toy body . The other end of the tab member R is formed with a rack

The intermediate portion R is formed integrally with the flipping member so as to become parallel to the tab member R. A rack is formed at the intermediate portion R so as to face the rack . A pinion gear engaged with the racks and is pivotally supported to the base . If the other end of the tab member R is operated so as to be pulled out from the toy body displacement of the tab member R is transmitted to the intermediate portion R via the rack the pinion gear and the rack and is converted into a movement in the lateral direction of the flipping member having the intermediate portion R formed thereat that is in a direction opposite to the tab member R. Accordingly the tip portion of the flipping member moves toward the launching port

Since the tab members L and R are arranged on both sides of the toy body across the launching port if the tab members L and R are simultaneously operated the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member approach each other. The flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then the flipping members and are restricted by operating the tab members L and R so as to be pulled out from the toy body . Subsequently the spherical body B is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

As shown in a sixth modification of the first embodiment includes first and second bars restriction members in the invention F and S. The two bars F and S are combined via a pin fixed to a rear portion of the base with respect to the launching port

A tip of the first bar F extends toward the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and abuts against the outside of the flipping member . Meanwhile a tip of the second bar S extends toward the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and abuts against the outside of the flipping member . A base end of the first bar F extends to the right side of the launching port via the pin and a base end of the second bar S extends to the left side of the launching port via the pin .

If the base ends of the first and second bars F and S are brought close to each other the tips of the first and second bars F and S pinch the flipping members and and the vertex of the flipping member and the vertex of the flipping member approach each other. The flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then the index finger and the middle finger are hooked to the base ends of the first and second bars F and S. Subsequently the pushing member is pushed into the toy body using the thumb. At this time the tips of the first and second bars F and S are operated by reaction forces acting on the base ends of the first and second bars F and S from the index finger and the middle finger so as to approach each other. This restricts the flipping members and . Subsequently the spherical body B loaded into the launching port is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

Particularly according to the sixth modification it is possible to operate the game piece launching toy even with single hand as if operating a syringe.

As shown in a seventh modification of the first embodiment includes restriction members L and R intermediate portions L and R and a ring member .

The restriction member L is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the base so as to be movable in a direction that is the lateral direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. A slope approaching the centerline Lc of the base as it goes forward in the launching direction of the spherical body B is formed on the inside of the restriction member L.

On the other hand the restriction member R is disposed on the right side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the base so as to be movable in a direction that is the lateral direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. A slope approaching the centerline Lc of the base as it goes forward in the launching direction of the spherical body B is formed on the inside of the restriction member R.

The intermediate portion L is formed integrally with the flipping member . The intermediate portion L is formed with a slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes backward in the launching direction of the spherical body B. On the other hand the intermediate portion R is formed integrally with the flipping member . The intermediate portion R is formed with a slope that becomes more distant from the flipping member as it goes backward in the launching direction of the spherical body B.

The ring member is arranged between the restriction members L and R so that the center of the ring member is parallel to the centerline Lc and is movable in the direction opposite to the launching direction of the spherical body B with respect to the base . An outer periphery of the ring member abuts against the slopes and of the restriction members L and R and an inner periphery of the ring member abuts against the slopes and of the intermediate portions L and R.

The restriction members L and R are arranged on both sides of the toy body across the launching port and the direction in which the restriction member L is pushed and the direction in which the restriction member R is pushed coincide with each other. If the restriction members L and R are simultaneously operated both approach each other and the spacing between the slope of the restriction member L and the slope of the restriction member R is narrowed. If the spacing between the slopes and is narrowed the ring member moves backward in the launching direction of the spherical body B and causes the flipping members and to approach each other via the intermediate portions L and R. Accordingly the flipping members and are restricted to a state in which the distance between the vertexes and is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then flipping members and are restricted by operating the restriction members and so as to be pushed into the toy body from both sides of the toy body while holding down the toy body with the hands. Subsequently the spherical body B is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

As shown in an eighth modification of the first embodiment includes a restriction member . In addition one flipping member out of the two flipping members and is fixed in place.

The restriction member is disposed on the left side of the launching port in the launching direction of the spherical body B and outside the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by the base so as to be movable in a direction that is the lateral direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B.

First the user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then the flipping member is restricted by operating the restriction member so as to be pushed into the toy body from a side while holding down the toy body with the hands. Subsequently the spherical body B is moved toward the tips of the flipping members and using the pushing member .

Since the subsequent operation is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

In the first embodiment of the invention including the first to eighth modifications the flipping members and are pivotally supported by the pins L and R. Incidentally the two flipping members that make a pair may be constituted by one part formed in a circular arc shape as in the related art. In this case the distance between the tips of the flipping members and is preferably greater than the diameter of the spherical body B. Thus if the forces applied to the restriction members are weakened after the spherical body B is launched from the toy body the flipping members and try to return to their initial positions by the elastic restoring force of the circular arc shaped part and consequently also return the restriction members to their initial positions.

A second embodiment of a game piece launching toy of the invention which is shown in will be described below.

The second embodiment of the invention includes a toy body one flipping member that launches the spherical body B as a game piece a pushing member that pushes the spherical body B loaded into the toy body and a restriction member that restricts a tip of the flipping member . All of the flipping member the pushing member and the restriction member are attached to the toy body .

A base of the toy body is formed with a launching port for the spherical body B. The flipping member is pivotally supported within the imaginary vertical plane by a pin fixed to an upper part of the base . Since the shape of the flipping member is the same as that of the flipping members and in the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will be omitted here.

The spacing between the launching port and the pin is clearly greater than the diameter of the spherical body B and the spherical body B placed on the launching port is movable toward the tip of the flipping member between the flipping member supported by the pin and the launching port

Since the structure of the pushing member is the same as that of the pushing member in the first embodiment a detailed description thereof will also be omitted here.

The restriction member is disposed above the flipping member with respect to the launching port and is supported by an upper member so as to be movable in the direction that is the vertical direction orthogonal to the launching direction of the spherical body B. If the restriction member is pushed into the toy body a tip of the restriction member abuts against an upper edge of the flipping member and a tip portion of the flipping member is rotated toward the launching port

If the restriction member is operated a vertex of the flipping member approaches the launching port . The flipping member is restricted to a state in which the spacing between the vertex and the launching port is maintained to be less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

The user loads the spherical body B into the launching port inside the toy body placed on the base plane. Then the flipping member is restricted by operating the restriction member so as to be pushed into the toy body from the top while holding down the toy body with the hands. Accordingly the spacing between the peak and the launching port becomes less than the diameter of the spherical body B.

Subsequently the spherical body B loaded into the launching port is moved toward the tip of the flipping member using the pushing member . The spherical body B is pushed by the pushing member is moved forward in the launching direction on the launching port and abuts against a rear oblique side of the flipping member . Meanwhile since the flipping member is restricted by the user s hands via the restriction member a force checking the movement of the spherical body B using the pushing member acts on the flipping member . If the spherical body B is further moved toward the tip of the flipping member against the force since the spherical body B abuts against the rear oblique side of the flipping member the tip portion of the flipping member is displaced against the restriction forces generated by the user s hands so as to widen the spacing between the vertex and the launching port . Then if the center of the spherical body B moves forward further than an imaginary vertical line L drawn down from the vertex to the launching port the spherical body B abuts against the front oblique side of the flipping member and is launched forward in the launching direction from the toy body by the restriction force acting on the flipping member by the user s hands.

According to the game piece launching toy configured as mentioned above when a user operates the restriction member while holding down the game piece launching toy with the hands the restriction force acting on the flipping member can be adjusted by adjusting the force input to the restriction member by user s hands. That is since the user can arbitrarily adjust the force launching the spherical body B from the toy body changes can be made to the speed of the spherical body B to be launched from the toy body . As a result the range of play using the game piece launching toy is broad and the user s enjoyment is enhanced.

Additionally in the first embodiment of the invention including the first to eighth modifications and the second embodiment the launching toy using the spherical body B as a game piece for play has been described. However an object that can be used for the game piece is not the spherical body only. For example anything is available if objects including a round surface on a portion of the surface thereof such as a disk are adopted.

Although the preferred embodiments of the invention have been described the invention is not limited to the above embodiments. Additions omissions substitutions and other modifications of components can be made without departing from the concept of the present invention. The invention is not to be considered as being limited by the foregoing description and is limited only by the scope of the appended claims.

The invention relates to a game piece launching toy including a toy body a flipping member installed on the toy body a pushing member configured to move a game piece placed on the toy body toward a tip of the flipping member and a restriction member installed on the toy body to be movable with respect to the toy body and operated by a user to restrict the flipping member the game piece being launched using a restriction force acting on the flipping member.

According to the invention since a user can arbitrarily adjust the force launching the game piece from the toy body the range of play using the game piece launching toy is broad and the user s enjoyment is enhanced.
