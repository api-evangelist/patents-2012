This application claims the benefit of priority from provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 482 078 filed on May 3 2011 entitled Process Impact Matrix Development and Utilization. Application Ser. No. 61 482 078 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates generally to a system and method for determining and utilizing process impacts for an organization and more particularly to a system and method for determining and utilizing the process impacts using a process impact matrix.

Organizations such as businesses strive to accomplish various goals in order to achieve success in various areas. Such organizations may implement different processes in order to accomplish the various goals or meet various challenges. However these organizations may not fully recognize the extent to which each process impacts the various goals and challenges. A full understanding of such impact may allow an organization to improve a level of success in accomplishing the various goals and meeting such challenges.

According to one aspect of the disclosure a process impact matrix may be generated including one or more overall challenges of an organization. Each of the overall challenges may include one or more common or unique goals sub challenges. A plurality of processes that may be implemented by the organization may be included in the process impact matrix. An impact level may be determined indicative of an impact or affect a respective process has on each goal sub challenge. The impact levels may be converted to impact scores. A weighting factor indicative of a relative significance between each of the goals sub challenges may be used to scale the impact scores. The impact scores for each process may be used to determine a relative impact score indicative of an overall impact of each process with respect to the other processes. The relative impact scores may be used to prioritize the processes for subsequent analysis.

Other systems methods features and advantages will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems methods features and advantages be included within this description be within the scope of the invention and be protected by the following claims.

Organizations across various industries may implement various processes to accomplish various goals of the organization. A Process may refer to a way of executing any capability of the organization to achieve a result. Processes may also be referred to as capabilities . Organizations may implement processes without fully recognizing the impact the processes may have in meeting various challenges to their particular goals. Fully recognizing such impacts may allow an organization to prioritize processes according to such impacts. Challenges an organization may address by implementing such processes may be broken down to allow various levels of such impacts to be identified and analyzed. For example these challenges may be broken down into macroeconomic challenges industry specific challenges and organization specific challenges.

Macroeconomic challenges may refer to challenges an organization may face in order to be successful on a large scale level such as a global level. While macroeconomic challenges are based on large scale considerations such challenges may vary regionally. Examples of such macroeconomic challenges may be reduction of operating costs and gaining access to emerging consumer markets.

Industry specific challenges may refer to challenges an organization may face in order to be successful in a specific industry such as oil refining gas production and energy retail for example. Such challenges may be based on industrial trends and may vary based on numerous factors such as a particular industry segment and regional differences but may typically apply to all organizations operating in a specific industry. Table 1 below provides several examples of industry specific challenges for a number of different industries. Both the industries and industry specific challenges listed are for purpose of example only and may include fewer or additional industries and industry specific challenges.

Organization specific challenges may refer to challenges specific to a particular organization such as specific needs of company shareholders or stakeholders for example. Various organization specific challenges may be considered such as increasing a share of a domestic market e.g. to support local security of supply and increasing share of gas production e.g. to support a gas downstream business for example.

An organization may have various goals and sub challenges associated with these challenges. These goals and sub challenges may be common to two or more of the challenges or may be unique with respect to a particular challenge. In order to identify which processes of an organization are most impactful regarding these goals and sub challenges and ultimately the overall challenges e.g. macroeconomic industry specific and organization specific a process impact matrix may be generated.

The process impact matrix may list each overall challenge and each associated goal sub challenge G S where x is the xgoal sub challenge. In there are a total of a number of r goals sub challenges with the macroeconomic challenges having a number of n challenges the industry specific challenges having m n 1 challenges and the organization specific challenges having a number r m 1 goals sub challenges . However a process may be common among overall challenges thus reducing the total number of different goals sub challenges . Each process P where x is the xprocess and s is the total number of processes may also be received by the process impact matrix . Each impact cell may receive an impact level rating indicating the level of impact that a particular process has on each goal sub challenge . In one example impact level rating of each process may be qualitatively expressed such as that shown in . For example the impact level rating of each process on each of the goals sub challenges may be expressed as high H medium M or low L impact. Determination of the impact rating level of a process for a goal sub challenge may be determined through various types of input.

Once the process impact matrix has been completed with the qualitative analysis a quantitative conversion may be applied to generate the process impact matrix as shown in . In one example such quantitative conversion may include use of a relative weighting factor of each goal sub challenge as compared to one another. The weighting factor may be expressed as a percentage and may indicate the overall importance of an associated goal sub challenge with respect to all other goals sub challenges . The process impact matrix may include a weighting factor cell in which the weighting factor of a particular goal sub challenge may be received. In one example as a boundary condition the weighting factors add up to 100 when all summed together.

Additionally the qualitative impact level rating of the process impact matrix may be converted to a quantitative impact level score . In the example of high impact may be converted to three medium impact may be converted to 2 and low impact may be converted to 1. Alternatively other conversion scales may be used. Upon completing the conversion each process may be given a relative impact score which may be indicated in a relative score cell . The relative impact score may indicate the overall relative impact of a process compared to the other processes .

In the example of the relative impact score for each process may be calculated as the total sum of each weighted quantitative impact level. For example in the quantitative impact level score for process Pmay include a weighted sum of 0.01 3 . . . 0.05 1 0.04 1 . . . 0.06 3 0.03 2 . . . 0.07 1 to equal over overall relative score of 1.6.

Process impact matrices such as those shown in may be developed using macroeconomic challenges and industry specific challenges predetermined prior to being used for a particular organization. Such a predetermination can be made because regardless of which particular organization is being evaluated the macroeconomic challenges and industry specific challenges may be common. However the organization specific challenges may be determined based on the specific details of a particular organization.

The process impact matrix may receive the qualitative impact levels . The weighting factors may be determined and the process impact matrix may receive the determined weighting factors . The qualitative impact levels may be converted to quantitative impact scores . Alternatively the quantitative impact scores may be input into the process impact matrix directly bypassing the use of the qualitative impact levels . The relative impact scores may be calculated for each process . Upon determination of the relative impact scores the processes may be prioritized from highest to lowest relative impact score .

In one example a process impact matrix module may be stored in the memory and executed by the processor . The term module may be defined to include a plurality of executable modules. As described herein the modules are defined to include software hardware or some combination thereof executable by the processor . Software modules may include instructions stored in the memory or other memory device that are executable by the processor or other processor. Hardware modules may include various devices components circuits gates circuit boards and the like that are executable directed and or controlled for performance by the processor . The process impact matrix module may receive input from the input device in order to generate the process impact matrix which may include the forms similar to that shown in . The process impact matrix module may provide the process impact matrix to a display via a connection . The connections may be physical or wireless connections or some combination thereof. The connections may be private network based Internet based or any other suitable network configuration. The computer device may be part of a network allowing multiple input devices which may include separate computer device display input device configurations to be used to access the process impact matrix module in order to generate a process impact matrix .

In an embodiment the processes may be related to an objective of a particular organization or to a service that may be performed in order to accomplish the objective. These objectives may be the overall challenge discussed above or may be other challenges or objectives. The services may be the associated goal sub challenge discussed above or other goals or services related to an objective.

A service analysis tool may be included as part of the process analysis system. The service analysis tool may be stored in the memory and executed by the processor . The service analysis tool may be executed to determine a strength of a service for accomplishing a particular objective to which the service is related. The service analysis tool may be configured to execute a first scoring module to process a matrix including process information related to processes associated with particular services and objectives to identify those processes for which challenges and objectives may be developed. The first scoring module may convert the process information of the matrix into a scoring matrix. The scoring matrix may include numerical scores indicative of particular attributes of each process process attribute . The service analysis tool may execute a second scoring module to determine for each service average scores associated with one or more process attribute categories based on the scoring matrix. The service analysis tool may execute a third scoring module to determine an overall strength score for each service with respect to each objective. The overall strength score for each service may be based on the average scores. The service analysis tool may be further configured to determine through execution of the first and second scoring modules average scores associated with one or more process attribute categories associated with processes directly related to objectives.

Each process may be associated with various process information. The process information may be related to various process attributes. For example each process may be associated with a plurality of process attributes PA . Each process attribute PA may be associated with a predetermined process attribute category ATT .

The process attribute category may represent a particular quality of a process. For example one attribute category may be Content Details which may describe a level of development of a particular process based on predetermined criteria. Another example attribute category may be whether or not a Capability Assessment Model CAM is defined for a particular process. A CAM may be a specific model defining various capability levels uniformly applied to each process. Another example attribute category may be whether or not a particular process is associated with one or more key performance indicators KPIs . In one example KPI may be defined as particular metric or measure indicative of a level of success of a particular process.

As discussed above the goal sub challenge may be related to the services associated with an objective. The goal sub challenges to be used in the process impact matrix may be determined based on the strength of service s related to the goal sub challenge determined by the service analysis tool discussed above. The service analysis tool may be also further configured to identify the process attributes in the process attribute category of each process for improvement that maximizes an increase in the strength of services with respect to accomplishment of the objective.

The CAM discussed above may be a high performance capability assessment HPCA model. The HPCA model helps a business such as an energy business meet the challenges of the global marketplace by defining a scale of performance mastery along which the current practices of the business may be located. Thus processes identified with the service analysis tool may be applied to accomplish an overall objective identified with the process impact matrix and then evaluated with the CAM to determine a scale of performance mastery or capability of the business to perform the identified process.

The HPCA model includes a key factor dimension and a performance mastery scale dimension. The performance mastery scale dimension defines multiple mastery levels. The performance mastery levels form a scale of increasing organizational performance. The scale includes a Basic mastery level a Progressive mastery level a Leading mastery level and an Emerging mastery level along a horizontal axis and each of the four mastery levels in some capability areas may be further defined with three additional aspects namely procedures people and technology. Each performance mastery level includes criteria specific to a corresponding key assessment area. Each key assessment area identifies some aspect of a capability of an energy business.

A business capability can be defined as a bundle of closely integrated skills knowledge technologies and cumulative learning that is exercised through a set of processes such as the processes and that collectively represents an organization s ability to create value by producing outcomes and results. Capability may also be the processes . Capability areas do not represent a delineation of organizational responsibilities as the business outcomes of a capability may be the result of a number of cross functional teams. Capabilities of a business such as an energy business may be grouped into platforms. For example the HPCA model groups the capabilities of the energy industry into three high level platforms corresponding to an integrated oil and gas industry which platforms may include a plan and manage enterprise platform an operational business platform and a support services platform. Platforms may include sub platforms as well as capabilities. For example the operational business platform for a particular business such as the energy business may include sub platforms such as sub platforms for exploration and production gas refining marketing operations hydrocarbon supply chain and non hydrocarbon supply chain. Each sub platform may contain the capabilities.

The key factor dimension included in the HPCA model may establish a set of key assessment areas in which to analyze the capabilities of a business. Key assessment areas include performance capability criteria. Performance capability criteria populate the performance capability assessment model. The performance capability criteria may be specific to any one of many different business capabilities. For example the exploration and production sub platform corresponding to the operational business platform of an energy business includes performance capability criteria for exploration and appraisal development production market and exploration and operations support at each of the capability levels along the performance capability scale dimension. Any number of performance capability assessment models and performance capability criteria may be defined and stored in a capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and application to a business under examination. Accordingly the HPCA model provides a flexible and adaptive scale of performance capability against which business practices may be compared to ascertain where the capabilities of a business under examination fall along the scale.

In an embodiment the HPCA model establishes a multidimensional industry performance reference set such as energy industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance levels further described below in reference Tables 2 5. The performance levels establish a scale of increasing effectiveness in delivery of each capability. The key assessment performance reference tables include a Basic delivery level a Progressive delivery level a Leading delivery level and an Emerging delivery level. The performance levels establish a scale of mastery along which current business practices may be located and identified with respect to any platform and capability within a platform according to an analysis of performance capability criteria PCC . The capability under evaluation may be assigned the performance level based on a delivery effectiveness position along the scale of mastery.

The Basic delivery level specifies Basic performance assessment criteria the Progressive delivery level specifies Progressive performance assessment criteria the Leading delivery level specifies a Leading performance assessment criteria and the Emerging delivery level specifies Emerging performance assessment criteria. The HPCA model receives input data that specifies a business platform such as an energy business platform e.g. an energy industry area and an industry key assessment area for analysis such as an energy industry key assessment area. The HPCA model searches the multidimensional industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that match the business industry platform and corresponding industry capability within the platform and the industry key assessment area. In addition the HPCA retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table. The HPCA model may initiate analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance assessment level for the industry key assessment area.

The capability under evaluation may be assigned a level of mastery based on the business position along the scale of mastery e.g. the basic progressive leading or emerging delivery level . Performance criteria corresponding to the basic progressive leading and emerging performance levels populate the HPCA model. The performance criteria capture characteristics and or other features of the delivery of a capability at particular performance level. Examples below illustrate performance criteria that provide analysis and bench marking for energy organizations. In other examples performance criteria for other types of business organizations may be illustrated. The HPCA model performance criteria provide a tool for determining where a platform and capability under examination falls along the scale of mastery.

For example business consultants and business process engineers may interview an energy business or receive data about the business to determine measure or otherwise ascertain the characteristics criteria and other features of a particular capability implemented within the business. The consultants and engineers may compare the characteristics of the business to the performance criteria in the HPCA model and arrive at an assessment level for the capability under examination. In doing so for example the consultants and engineers may identify where the capability under examination falls in terms of the performance level for each key assessment area of a capability and determine an overall position on the scale of mastery for the capability under examination. Performance criteria may populate the HPCA model in whole or in part. Multiple high performance capability assessments may be collected and stored with the performance criteria for future retrieval and possible modification in a capability detail pool.
