In certain exemplary embodiments the touch screen assembly is configured to receive and recognize inputs also called interactions from a user who interacts with the touch screen . The exemplary touch screen assembly shown in includes a touch screen a layer of glass and a TFT screen . The exemplary touch screen is configured to act as a direct interface with the user. In other words the user may touch and or otherwise interact with the top surface of the touch screen to communicate with the in wall switching device with touch screen interface . For example the touch screen may include two or more metallic electrically conductive and resistive layers that are physically separated by some distance. When an object e.g. a finger a stylus touches the touch screen the two layers make contact at and or near that point of contact and register a change in electrical current. The touch screen may be solid clear opaque e.g. frosted semi transparent or any other type of shading. The touch screen may be one or more of any number of colors.

The layer of glass typically serves multiple purposes e.g. acts as a communication medium between the touch screen and the TFT screen act as a medium through which a piezoelectric effect is measured serves as a supporting substrate . As shown below with respect to the layer of glass is optional and may not be included in certain exemplary embodiments. In one or more alternative exemplary embodiments there is more than one layer of glass. For example each layer of glass is either stacked next to each other separated by the touch screen and or separated by the TFT screen .

In this example the length and width of the touch screen the layer of glass and the transistor area of the TFT screen are substantially similar. For example the length may be 46.23 mm and the width may be 29.06 mm. In addition the glass may have a thickness of 4.4 mm. In addition the length and or width of the TFT screen may be greater than the length and or width of the touch screen . In this example the length of the TFT screen is 55.88 mm. In other words the surface area of the touch screen is less than the surface area of the TFT screen . As another example the surface are of the touch screen may be between 60 and 90 of the surface area of the TFT screen .

Referring to the wall plate is substantially the same as the wall plate described above with respect to . The exemplary top housing has a narrower profile around its perimeter face which allows more of the touch screen to be exposed when the top housing is coupled to the touch screen . In addition the exemplary touch screen has two painted portions one along the top end and one along the bottom end of the touch screen . Alternatively a painted portion is provided on only one of the top and bottom ends of the touch screen . The painted portions designate areas of the touch screen where an interaction from the user is not registered.

In certain exemplary embodiments the painted portions designate portions of the touch screen that are not positioned directly above or otherwise in communication with a portion of the TFT screen . The painted portions may be painted frosted taped and or otherwise suitably covered to designate the areas of the touch screen where an interaction is not registered. The painted portions may be solid clear opaque e.g. frosted semi transparent and or any other type of shading. The painted portions may be one or more of any number of colors. In addition the painted portion at the top of the touch screen the painted portion at the bottom of the touch screen and or the unpainted portion of the touch screen may have the same and or different dimensions height width shading and or color relative to each other. For example the painted portion at the top of the touch screen the painted portion at the bottom of the touch screen may be opaque while the touch screen may be transparent.

The dimensions e.g. height width of the painted portions and or unpainted portion of the touch screen may vary. For example the painted portion at the bottom of the touch screen may extend up from the bottom edge of the touch screen to a point less than 25 up a longitudinal length of the touch screen . As another example the painted portion at the top of the touch screen may extend down from the top edge of the touch screen to a point less than twenty five percent down a longitudinal length of the touch screen . As another example the unpainted portion of the touch screen may cover at least 60 of the total surface area for the touch screen .

In addition the dimensions of the TFT screen the transistor area and the border are substantially the same as those described above with respect to . As a result the painted portions cover areas of the touch screen where the touch screen does not overlap with the transistor area of the TFT screen .

Further as shown in the layer of glass is removed and the length and width of the touch screen are substantially similar to those of the TFT screen . In this case the length and width of the TFT screen are the same as those of the transistor area . In other words the TFT screen in this case has no border. Here the length and width of the touch screen and the TFT screen are approximately 62.74 mm and 29.06 mm respectively. In certain exemplary embodiments in such a case the dimensions of the touch screen are substantially the same as the aperture in the wall plate . As such the entire touch screen may register an interaction from a user.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other configurations and or technologies associated with touch screens may be used with exemplary embodiments discussed herein. Further other interaction sensing technologies e.g. voice recognition and translation movement recognition may be used instead of or along with a touch screen assembly in exemplary embodiments.

Examples of other interactions that the user may perform to change the interactive template being presented on the GUI include but are not limited to making a swiping motion between the top and bottom of the touch screen making a swiping motion proximate to the touch screen without actually touching the touch screen and saying page forward. Each GUI presented on the touch screen may include different features that allow various selections commands and or other input to be received from the user . In addition a GUI may change or a new GUI may be presented based on a selection command and or other input received from the user on a previous GUI .

The following description in conjunction with describes an example in accordance with one or more exemplary embodiments. The example is for explanatory purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope. Terminology used in may be used in the example without further reference to those figures.

Referring to consider the following example using the in wall switching device with touch screen interface of described above. As shown in the GUI of the in wall switching device with touch screen interface is turned off. The GUI may be off because no interaction had been received by the user for some period of time. The GUI may also be off because the user manually turned the GUI off. To turn the GUI on the user touches the touch screen for example with a finger or stylus at any point on the touch screen .

After a second or two as shown in as the touch screen warms up a GUI showing an advertisement e.g. a manufacturer a product name may appear momentarily. After a few more seconds as shown in a GUI for control of a lighting fixture appears on the touch screen .

The GUI of includes several features. On the lower portion of the GUI is an icon of a light bulb and the word LIGHT to denote that the controls and information shown on the GUI are for the light fixture associated with the in wall switching device with touch screen interface . If there is more than one light fixture associated with the in wall switching device with touch screen interface then additional information additions and or changes may be displayed on the GUI to communicate which particular lighting fixture is the subject of the GUI . For example the word Ceiling light or table lamp next to entrance door may replace the word LIGHT .

Continuing with the middle portion of the GUI includes a slide bar with a slider that simulate a dimmer switch. The level of light given off by the light fixture is determined by the position of the slider on the slide bar . In addition the position of the slider on the slide bar is shown numerically as a percentage in the upper right of the GUI . In this example the percentage is 42 . The slider may be repositioned on the slide bar in one or more of a number of ways. For example the user may touch a finger on the slider at its current location move his finger up or down the slide bar while maintaining contact with the touch screen and remove his finger from the touch screen at the target location on the slide bar . As another example the user may tap the slider on the touch screen with a stylus and subsequently tap a target location of the slide bar on the touch screen with the stylus.

The lighting device may also be turned on and off by touching the ON and OFF words respectively on the GUI . The GUI may also display an efficiency level as shown in the upper left portion of the GUI . In this case the higher the efficiency the more leaves that are shown for the efficiency level on the GUI .

In this example the user places a finger on the slider at its current location of 42 moves his finger down the slide bar while maintaining contact with the touch screen and removes his finger from the touch screen at the target location of 30 on the slide bar . The end result is shown in . When the dimmer is set to 30 on the GUI the controller in the in wall switching device with touch screen interface sends a signal e.g. reduced voltage and or current to the lighting fixture to illuminate at 30 of the rated wattage for the lighting element of the light fixture. The user then wants to control the ceiling fan associated with the in wall switching device with touch screen interface . To do so the user swipes his finger from the right side of the touch screen to the left side of the touch screen. The resulting screen is shown in .

Continuing with the middle portion of the GUI includes a slide bar with a slider that simulate a slidable fan setting switch. The speed of the ceiling fan is determined by the position of the slider on the slide bar . Here rather than a percentage the slide bar has discrete settings of OFF speed 1 speed 2 and speed 3 . In one or more exemplary embodiments speed 1 may be replaced with LOW speed 2 may be replaced with MEDIUM and speed 3 may be replaced with HIGH. As with the slider described above with respect to the slider may be repositioned on the slide bar in one or more of a number of ways.

In this example the user turns on the ceiling fan to speed 2 medium speed by tapping a stylus at level 2 on the slide bar of the GUI . The result of the user s actions with regard to the ceiling fan from is shown in . When the fan control is set to level 2 on the GUI the controller in the in wall switching device with touch screen interface sends a signal e.g. reduced voltage and or current to the ceiling fan to run the fan motor at medium speed. The user then wants to set a timer for the light and ceiling fan. To access the appropriate GUI the user again swipes his finger from the right side of the touch screen to the left side of the touch screen. The resulting screen is shown in .

Continuing with the middle portion of the GUI includes a number of timer settings that are separated from each other by a series of parallel lines . Just above the icon and word TIMER on the GUI are selections for hours HR and minutes . In this example HR is selected because it is shown in bold on the GUI and MIN is deselected because it is shown in shadow on the GUI . Further up on the GUI are a number of time increment selections. In this example the time increment selections are OFF 1 2 5 and 10 . The selected time measure HR appears after each time increment selection e.g. 1 HR 10 HR . In OFF is currently selected because it is the only time increment selection that is shown in bold on the GUI .

To set the timer for 2 hours the user selects leaves the time measure of HR selected and selects 2 HR . The result of this selection by the user is shown in . In other words the light fixture and the ceiling fan will turn off based on a signal e.g. cut power sent in two hours by the controller in the in wall switching device with touch screen interface to the light fixture and the ceiling fan. If there is not further interaction from the user after one minute then the GUI dims as shown in . If after an additional four minutes there is no further interaction from the user the in wall switching device with touch screen interface including the GUI shuts off as shown in .
