The operations further include storing in a searchable database a user list identifier corresponding to the user list and the associated metadata and providing a user interface that includes the user list identifier and the corresponding associated metadata. The user interface is configured to receive one or more management instructions related to the user list from a user list subscriber.

The searchable database can be different from the owner database. The API can be configured to make available to the owner database one or more functionalities available at the searchable database. The API can be configured to facilitate management of the user list as stored in the searchable database using an application available at the owner database. The application can allow a data owner to manage a license of the user list. A price of the license can be negotiated with the user list subscriber. The metadata can further include at least one of population data describing statistical or inferred data related to the user list or members in the user list and subscription data including data concerning use of the user list. The population data can include qualification data describing qualifications for members to be included in a user list. The population data can include a number of members in the user list. The subscription data can include cost information for subscribing to a user list. The metadata can include demographic data. At least a portion of the metadata can be inferred from data selected from a group consisting of web sites visited videos viewed types of searches conducted determined related interest categories determined geographical distribution and calculated score for a probability to purchase goods or services. The storing in the searchable database can include indexing one or more of the user list identifier and the metadata. The user interface can be further configured to present a price of the user list to a potential user list subscriber. The management instructions can include an indication that a potential user list subscriber wishes to license or subscribe to the user list. The user interface can be configured to present conditions for licensing or subscribing to the user list. The user interface can be configured to present information representing a performance of the user list. The information can include one or more of names of licensees or subscribers of the user list a metric indicating an effectiveness of the user list revenue generated using the user list and a number of clicks generated using the user list.

Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented so as to realize none one or more of the following advantages. The API allows integration of a data owner database with a database of a hosting entity. The data owner is able to manage data hosted by the hosting entity without having to access a user interface provided by the hosting entity. Functionalities available at the hosting entity can be made available through the API to a data owner side application. Metadata can be shared between the data owner database and the hosting entity database after integration of the databases performed through the API. Data owners are able to use the hosting entity as a distribution manager to interact with potential subscribers and programmatically manage data hosted by the hosting entity. A potential subscriber can view information regarding data including for example metadata owned by a plurality of data owners through a user interface provided by the hosting entity without having to separately access user interfaces of the individual data owners.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

Advertisers publishers and service providers generally may wish to exchange data for purposes of implementing a meaningful way of providing information and or services e.g. advertising content to online users. If specific content is determined to be meaningful to a particular user then the user may wish to access the content purchase the content or otherwise interact with the content. This interaction can provide revenue to the content provider e.g. advertiser publisher or service provider . If an entity e.g. advertiser publisher or service provider can collect data about how specific content may or may not be meaningful to users e.g. in the form of a user list the collected data may be used by others in a variety of ways. Such data collection is done subject to permissions from the users and within the bounds of applicable privacy laws. For example users can opt out of being included in the compiled user lists. One use relates to selecting content of interest. Other uses are possible such as in adjusting bids in an auction based system for example on user lists that indicate specific content is of interest to one or more users. In general an entity that complies or creates the user lists or collects data pertaining to the user lists can be referred to as a data owner. In a data exchange system there can be many e.g. hundreds of data owners that create or compile various types and forms of user lists. User lists can be published sold licensed or otherwise accessed to assist in providing personalized content to the specific users and increasing revenue for a content provider.

The data owners can provide access to their user lists through their respective user interfaces. However for an existing or potential subscriber that deals with a large number of user lists from various data owners accessing individual data owners interfaces could be challenging. In such cases it may be advantageous to host the user lists from various data owners at a central entity that various data owners as well as subscribers can access. The methods and systems described herein can allow data owners to integrate their respective databases with a centralized database through an application programming interface API . Subscribers can then access the user lists from various data owners through a user interface provided by the centralized database. This allows the subscribers to browse available user lists without having to access user interfaces provided directly from the individual data owners.

In some implementations user lists can represent specific user information pertaining to predefined categories. The categories can be defined by the data owners. For example a user list may include data about one or more users which characterizes the users to a category e.g. homeowner craftsman DVD renter etc. to allow delivery of contentment of interest to the users by for example publishers or advertisers. In some implementations the user lists can be used to deliver relevant content of interest.

User lists can be generated and exchanged according to a number of rules and those rules can be used to market particular user lists to specific consumers. The rules can employ methods of assigning users to particular user lists. Such rules can provide a logical categorization of data information or services for the purposes of determining which data content in the user lists is particularly relevant to a number of users. The application programming interface described herein can allow data owners to programmatically manage for example through rule based manipulations data stored or hosted in the centralized database.

The user lists can be provided to the data exchange engine and maintained by the data exchange and or by the data owners . User lists can be updated as appropriate to either refine the category categories associated therewith or the users that are members of a given list. A category for a particular user list can be specified for example in metadata associated with or related to the particular user list. In some implementations the data exchange engine can be configured to provide an application programming interface API that allows one or more software components from a data owner s side to communicate with one or more software component of the data exchange engine . In some implementations the API can be a software specification that includes one or more of functions routines subroutines data structures object classes and variables. The API can be tangibly embodied on a computer readable storage device. The API can be implemented in accordance with a standard e.g. using Portable Operating System Interface or POSIX using vendor specific APIs or using libraries available in a programming language e.g. using Java APIs . In some implementations the API can be implemented as independent of the programming language such that it can be invoked from various computing environments.

In some implementations the API can be configured to integrate a data platform of the data owner with a data platform of the data exchange engine . Integration of the data platforms from the two sides can include for example integration of an owner database with the searchable database associated with the data exchange engine . Such integration can allow a data owner to move data e.g. user lists stored in the owner database to the searchable database while retaining the capability to manage the data through applications used to manage the owner database .

The API can also be configured to provide functionalities available at the data exchange engine to owner side applications such as the applications used to manage the owner database . For example while the database management system DBMS for the owner database and the searchable database may differ from one another the API can allow a data owner to manage user lists stored in the searchable database using the DBMS for the owner database . The term DBMS as used herein refers to computer programs that can be used to control creation use and or maintenance of a database.

In some implementations the API can allow sharing of metadata between the owner database and the searchable database . The metadata corresponding to a particular user list can include any appropriate information related to the user list such as a human readable name category timestamp source expiration date and size. In some implementations the API allows a data owner to enter edit delete or otherwise mange metadata related to user lists stored in the searchable database .

In general the metadata can include various parameters and attributes related to the user list and can increase a meaningfulness of the user list to a potential or current subscriber. For example the metadata can include data describing one or more categories for a user list population data describing statistical or inferred data concerning a list or members in a given user list and subscription data including data concerning use of a given user list. Metadata can be associated with a user list for example by a data owner. In some implementations metadata can be associated with a user list by a non owner of the user list.

The data describing a category for a user list can be for example a category name such as travel luxury goods or sports . A given user list can have multiple associated categories. For example a given user list can have associated categories of luxury and automobile. 

Population data can include for example statistical or inferred data concerning a user list. For example population data can include a date of creation of the user list. As another example population data can include data concerning one or more ratings or reviews for a user list. For example an average review score or a popularity rating can be associated with a user list. As another example user review comments can be associated with a user list.

Population data can also include information describing a schema or format of the user list data. For example population data can include information indicating a number of fields included in the user list data and a data type for the fields. For fields of an enumerated type population data can include indications of possible values allowed for the field. For fields of a numerical data type population data can include minimum and maximum values allowed for the field.

Population data can also include statistical or inferred data concerning members in a given user list. For example population data for a given user list can include a count of the number of members in the user list data indicating a time of updates to the user list e.g. date of last member addition date of last member deletion and other statistics regarding data concerning members in the user list. For example for an enumerated field included in user list data population data can include one or more statistics which indicate a distribution of values across user list members for the field. For a numerical field included in user list data population data can include statistics such as minimum and maximum stored values a mean value or a median value. In some implementations population data can also include one or more statistics indicating likely page views for a given member of a user list on a given slice of inventory.

Population data can include qualification data describing qualifications for members to be included in a user list. For example qualification data can include a number of page views required by a member to qualify for membership in a user list. As another example qualification data can include criteria indicating a set of sites to be visited by a member or one or more types of sites to be visited by a member for a member to qualify for inclusion in a user list. As yet another example qualification data can include one or more search keywords to be entered by a member for a member to qualify for inclusion in a user list. Qualification data can also indicate criteria for a member to be excluded or dropped from a user list. For example a criterion can specify that a member is removed from a given user list if they do not enter any search keywords associated with the user list during a given time period e.g. two weeks .

In some implementations metadata for a user list can include in addition to population data subscription data including data concerning use of a given user list. For example subscription data can include cost information for subscribing to a user list. In some implementations cost information can be described in terms of a cost per one thousand impressions CPM . That is cost information can indicate a cost for using a user list to generate one thousand impressions.

Subscription data can also include restrictions on use of the user list. For example a data owner can indicate that user list data for a given user list may not be combined with other data or that the user list data may not be combined with certain types of other data e.g. competitor data or data having a particular subject matter or of a particular category . A data owner can specify that user list data is applicable to or restricted to use associated with a particular geographic region. Subscription data can indicate whether use restrictions are negotiable or non negotiable.

Subscription data can also include descriptions of best practices for use of a user list. For example subscription data can include descriptions of particular uses of user list data that have been demonstrated through testing to be effective. As a more particular example subscription data can include descriptions of other types of data that have been effective when combined with given user list data.

In some implementations metadata associated with a user list can include data developed by a non owner of the user list. For example the developed data can include data relating to cross correlations between members included in the user list. For example the data exchange engine can develop correlations by analyzing data known by the data exchange engine about members in a given user list owned by a data owner . The data exchange engine can perform analysis if given permission by the data owner .

Developed data can also include data relating to inferences about members included in a user list. For example in some implementations the data exchange engine can infer data about members included in a user list such as demographic data e.g. geographical distribution data about sites visited data indicating videos viewed by members in a user list types of searches conducted by members in the user list determined related interest categories of members in the user list and other data or statistics about members in a user list such as calculated scores indicating a probability that a given member is interested in purchasing goods or services.

In some implementations the data owners can interact with the API through an owner interface . In some implementations the owner interface can be configured to accept user list management instructions from the data owner and pass on the instructions to the data exchange engine through the application programming interface. An example of such an owner interface is shown in . Even though in the example of the owner interface is rendered in a browser the owner interface can also be provided as a stand alone application e.g. as an application for a smartphone . The owner interface allows a data owner to manage one or more user lists owned by the data owner. The data owner can add delete edit license activate suspend or otherwise manage the user lists through the owner interface .

In some implementations the owner interface can also be configured to allow the data owner to manage licensees or subscribers of one or more user lists also referred to as segments data segments or audience segments owned by the data owner . This is illustrated as an example in . The owner interface can be configured to receive licensee management instructions from the data owner and pass on the instructions to the data exchange engine . The licensee management instructions can include for example adding suspending reinstating activating or deleting a licensee or a user list licensed by or subscribed to by the licensee.

Referring again to in some implementations the data exchange engine can be configured to provide a user interface for subscribers e.g. advertisers and others to browse review and or license user lists available in the searchable database . shows an example user interface for a marketplace for presenting user lists to potential or existing subscribers . The presented user lists can include for example the lists that are available in the searchable database lists that satisfy one or more search criteria or lists that correspond to some other filter criteria. The data owners and the potential subscribers can be anonymized from one another in the user interfaces.

The user interface can include an available user lists area for presenting information about user lists to which potential subscribers can subscribe. In some implementations the user lists area can display metadata related to the available user lists. This can include for example a user list name a provider e.g. a data owner a subscription cost e.g. in terms of CPM one or more categories an average review and a user count . For example an available user list has a name of Adventure travel in market is provided by a data owner named User5 has a cost of 2.25 CPM is included in the category travel has an average review of four out of five stars and has one hundred fifty four thousand users.

The user interface can include a filters area which a subscriber can use to filter the user lists displayed in the user interface to show user lists matching one or more criteria. For example criteria specifies to show user lists for which a category includes travel and for which a subscription cost is less than or equal to five dollars per one thousand impressions. The subscriber can edit the criteria or define new criteria by selecting a control to display a filters interface. In some implementations one or more quick filters may be displayed based on characteristics of a subscriber s currently subscribed to user lists or other historical data e.g. based on prior use popularity or prior viewing history . For example a quick filter may be selected to display available user lists that are comparable to one or more of a subscriber s currently subscribed to user lists but at a lower subscription cost. In some implementations the user interface can also include a search interface for searching specific user lists.

In some implementations the user interface can include one or more recommendations. In the example of a recommendation for a user list named International business travelers is displayed. The recommendation can display a rating for the user list e.g. four out of five stars a subscription cost for the user list e.g. 4.75 CPM and the provider of the user list e.g. User5 . The recommendation can also indicate that the user list is based on a business travelers user list with a subscription cost of 5.15 CPM provided by User6 . The recommendation can include a control which can be selected to subscribe to the user list . A control can be selected to dismiss the recommendation . Further another recommendation for a user list indicates that the user list is not yet rated has a subscription cost of 2.5 CPM is provided by User7 was added this month and is based on the category of travel . A control can be selected to subscribe to the user list .

In some implementations when a potential subscriber indicates intent to buy or subscribe to a particular segment or user list for example by selecting the control or the potential subscriber can be presented with an appropriate control or interface to bid on the particular segment. The offer or bid from the potential subscriber can be passed back to the data exchange engine and provided to the corresponding data owner for example using the owner interface through the API . The API can be further configured to receive from the data owner possibly through the owner interface an indication of whether the offer or bid is acceptable by the data owner . In some implementations the API can also be configured to receive a counter offer from the data owner . The acceptance rejection or counter offer from the data owner can be conveyed to the data exchange engine and eventually presented to the potential subscriber for example through the user interface . The API can therefore facilitate a negotiation between a potential subscriber and a data owner .

In some implementations a plurality of APIs can be used in place of a single API . For example a first API can be used to integrate metadata information between the owner database and the searchable database whereas a second API can be used for implementing the negotiation functionalities between subscribers and data owners. Additional APIs can be used for implementing other functionalities without departing from the scope of this disclosure.

In some implementations the data exchange engine can create an exchange between owners of permissioned data and users of such data. Users of the permissioned data can include sponsored content providers e.g. advertisers that seek to deliver content of interest to particular categories of users. In some implementations the data exchange engine provides a mechanism for a provider of advertising placement services in interest based online advertising to make available additional third party data sources to buyers of advertising space. In some implementations the data exchange engine can provide user lists to publishers syndicates and other data providers for various purposes including interest based delivery of sponsored content to users.

The content server can provide sponsored content e.g. ads or other content to any number of browsers via the data exchange engine or directly. In addition the content server can be configurable for receiving content requests and providing content to requesting users. In operation the content server can select sponsored content based on one or more criteria and in view of data that is included in one or more user lists. The content server can also provide access to other storage elements such as repositories in the example shown as content repository . The content repository can be used to store content for example advertising content associated with particular keywords bidding criteria advertisers and criteria for delivering content of interest. Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data including without limitation arrays hash tables lists and pairs. The content server can access other similar types of data storage devices such as the searchable database for example.

In some implementations subscribers e.g. advertisers can work with data owners to subscribe to purchase or license user lists for purposes of delivering content of interest e.g. based on demographic categories interest categories or preference categories . The user lists can be analyzed for quality and other considerations. The subscribers can use the user lists for determining criteria for delivering content of interest or to modify current bids for example. In one example use case an advertiser can subscribe for a period of time to a user list. The user list itself may be defined as being associated with a certain category e.g. Internet shoppers interested in buying a sports car of users. Requests for advertisements can be received by the advertising system and the data exchange can be used to determine for a given user to which user lists the user is subscribed. In a real time bid example the advertisers that have subscribed to the user lists may be presented with the request and information on users satisfying the category or categories associated with the user lists allowing the advertisers to adjust submit bids in consideration of such information.

In some implementations the third party servers can provide third party services to any number of browsers via the data exchange engine . For example the third party servers can provide web services advertising services or external APIs application programming interfaces to connect to a third party server. The third party servers can include for example one or more servers executing a search engine application program. In some implementations the third party servers can include a related information server or a content server. In some implementations the third party servers can gather information related to user activity using for example cookies .

The browser represents a user browsing the Internet and can be substantially similar to the browser described above. The browser can access any website available on a network belonging to a person or any other type of entity such as a company enterprise etc. For example in browser can access a service or website. The service or website can be hosted by the third party server or alternatively by another server associated with system . A user can employ the browser to search the Internet for services information or merchandise. In some implementations the browser can gather information related to user activity using the cookies .

In some implementations the content server can be configured to customize advertising content according to one or more user lists. In particular the content server can be configured to customize the display criteria language or other content of an advertisement according to user list information. For example if a particular user list includes user entered searching pertaining to purchasing a vehicle the content server can use the user entered searching information e.g. a cookie stored from performing a web search in a browser to customize the display or content of content such as an advertisement. The customization can for example provide the user with a more relevant content.

In some implementations the browser can make a request for advertising content from the content server or the third party server . The data exchange engine can retrieve a list of user lists from the table based repository associated with a received request and append or otherwise associate the list of user lists to the request. Any subsequent processing of the request can use the list for example for delivering content of interest advertising customization and bid generation. The list of user lists or portions of the list can also be transmitted to a real time bidder to provide the bidder with pertinent information about one or more users.

A user list can be identified based on owned or permissioned data. The identified user list can be associated with an owner database such as the database described with reference to . The user list associated with the owner database can be formatted in accordance with a first data platform e.g. an owner side data structure that is used to store data in the owner database . In some implementations the user list can be provided by a data owner to the data exchange engine . In some implementations the user list can be generated by the data exchange engine for example from data provided by the data owner . The user list can be identified for example using a user list identifier associated with the user list. Such a user list identifier can be determined for example by the data owner or for example by another entity such as the data exchange engine .

An API can be provided to communicate with the owner database . The API can be provided for example by an entity such as the data exchange engine . In some implementations the API can be substantially similar to the API described above with reference to . Providing the API can also include providing an owner interface e.g. the owner interface of to allow the data owner to manage and or edit the user list. In some implementations the API can be configured to integrate the first data platform with a second data platform associated the data exchange engine . For example the API can allow sharing of metadata between the first and second data platforms.

Metadata related to the user list can be received from the owner database through the API. The metadata can include for example data describing a category for the user list. In some implementations the metadata can include various parameters and attributes related to the user list as described above with reference to .

A user list identifier identifying the user list and the associated metadata is stored in a searchable database . Storing can include indexing the metadata for ease of retrieval based on received queries. Storing can be performed for example by the data exchange engine . The user list identifier and the associated metadata can be stored for example in the searchable database described with reference to

A user interface can be provided to subscribers of the user list. The user interface can be substantially similar to the user interface described above with reference to and can be presented to both potential as well as existing subscribers. In some implementations the user interface can be used to publish available user lists from one or more data owners. For example the user interfaces illustrated in can be presented to subscribers. The user interface can be configured to receive one or more management instructions related to the user list from a subscriber. For example a potential subscriber can buy a particular user list using the interface. In another example an existing subscriber can manage licensed or bought user lists through the user interface. This can include for example reviewing performance reports related to user lists applying one or more rules related to the user lists to deliver content of interest and negotiating or renegotiating the price of a particular user list with the corresponding data owner.
