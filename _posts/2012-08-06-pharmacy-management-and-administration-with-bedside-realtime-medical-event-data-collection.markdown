This application is a Divisional Patent Application claiming the benefit of the parent patent application Ser. No. 12 765 681 filed Apr. 22 2010 having the same title as this application hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Both applications claim the benefit of the following provisional applications each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety 

U.S. Ser. No. 61 171 767 filed Apr. 22 2009 entitled SYSTEMS METHODS AND DEVICES FOR AUTOMATED ORDERING DISPENSING REPORTING AND BILLING OF MEDICATION AND THE ASSOCIATED REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATION and U.S. Ser. No. 61 315 775 filed Mar. 19 2010 entitled REAL TIME HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATION AND OUTCOME DATA COLLECTION AND RECORD UPDATE FOR CARE ADMINISTRATION PLANNING OUTCOME PREDICTION AND PREVENTION.

This invention relates to systems methods and devices for automated ordering dispensing reporting and billing of medication and the associated reporting and documentation of the administration of medication.

A common scenario with respect to the ordering dispensing reporting billing and documentation of a prescribed medication begins with a physician s handwritten order. This handwritten order must be transmitted to the pharmacy typically the order is faxed. In other instances the order can be entered into an electronic computerized physician order entry system CPOE . A person at the pharmacy reviews the physician order and enters the order into the pharmacy s order management system. This is also the case even where the order is an electronic order such as like one entered into a CPOE system. That is some sort of manual data entry step takes place to get the order into the pharmacy s order management system. After the data is manually entered the drug interaction and allergy verification takes place which may be performed by a software application which is part of the CPOE system or the pharmacy s order management system. Once the drug interaction and allergy verification step is complete the pharmacist approves the order which allows it to be filled and then the drug is dispensed and packaged.

A common way to dispense medications is in a 30 day or a 7 day supply. In long term care and other institutional like settings for example dispensed medications are delivered to the facility where they will be administered to the patient 150. If there is a change to a patient s prescription during the 30 day cycle for example for which the medication was dispensed then the unused medication must be returned or destroyed. This adds an additional burden to facilities in that they must adhere to proper destruction procedures and document them accordingly. Dealing with ordered medications which have been dispensed and delivered but which are no longer current places a heavy financial burden on payers e.g. health care facilities insurance companies patients and the like and on the pharmacies because many times they are paying for a supply of medications that the patient never uses.

Regarding the administration of the medication regulations require that the administration of the medication must be documented with a certain degree of specificity and accuracy. Regulations also require a review of such documentation for example on a periodic basis. The administration process is further complicated by brand and generic drugs and multiple brands within the generic medications. Accurate maintenance of the records requires the prescriber dispensing pharmacy and the administering system and personnel to be in sync with respect to the identification of the medications.

Patient symptom gathering is another area of concern with respect to the accuracy and validity of common practices. At patient touch points clinicians are often required to listen to a patient describe symptoms and enter those symptoms in a structured language that allows medical personnel to understand how the clinician views the patient report of symptoms. This process naturally introduces misinformation clinician bias information gaps and other factors that contribute to the recorded symptom being different than that reported by the patient. Patients generally report symptoms e.g. side effects related to an administration of a medication sooner and with more specificity than is often reported in clinical studies and the like.

During a patient interview e.g. office visit symptoms may not always be reported because clinicians and patients are distracted from this activity by reviewing test results and the like. Ensuring that accurate patient generated symptom reports are captured at least with each patient touch point may be a critical deficiency in medical practice. Also in a report authored by a patient the symptoms tend to be more accurately described than when the same patient is interviewed orally by a clinician. Ensuring accurate and timely side effect reporting may be critical to proper and effective medication management.

It is therefore an object of the invention to address the shortcomings described above along with others that are apparent in this disclosure.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

The prescribing facility may allow a doctor physician nurse pharmacist or a healthcare specialist to enter an order for a prescription of a medication or other medical care items for a patient. The HPDMA may apply a plurality of identification methods to uniquely identify record and document details of person entering the orders. The prescribing facility may be communicatively coupled in real time to a backbone network . The backbone network may be a network that may be communicatively coupled to other facilities of the HPDMA and elsewhere and may carry medical data being communicated among the facilities such as real time medical data event packets files or streams. The exemplary medical event data being carried over the backbone may include information from any of the facilities depicted in including without limitation prescribing units care planning facilities laboratories and imaging centers insurance and payments units rehabilitation and LTC facilities electronic medical record repositories dashboards and databases third party sites healthcare facilities and the like. In an exemplary case the backbone network may be the Internet an intranet a Wide Area Network a Local Area Network a wireless network a personal area network a virtual private network or any other type of wired wireless or logical network including ad hoc peer to peer hub and spoke tree ring serial infrastructure type protocols and the like. The backbone network may also facilitate secure communication among different facilities of the HPDMA using firewalls password protection anti virus protection packet inspection spam filtering and other security facilities.

Further the prescribing facility may obtain patient information via the backbone network . The information may include the medical history clinical outcomes allergic reactions to certain types of drugs and similar kind of information related to the patient. The prescribing facility may also allow the healthcare specialist to prescribe medication such as through an electronic order entry facility not shown in . In an example the electronic order entry facility may comprise an interface for aiding a healthcare specialist to prescribe the medication or treatment for the patient. The prescribing facility may present the obtained patient information to the healthcare specialist to help facilitate prescribing appropriate medication or treatment for the patient. Once the healthcare specialist enters the prescription of the patient in the electronic order entry facility the prescribing facility may communicate the prescription to the backbone network or may sent it directly to the prescription management facility and in embodiments directly to the prescription validation selection facility therein. This communication may be done in real time as an event. Further the prescription may be made available to all other facilities of the HPDMA via the backbone network .

In an embodiment of the invention the prescription from the prescription facility may be raw prescription data associated with the patient. The raw prescription data may not be in a format that may be integrated with the E EHR E EMR facility . The prescription facility may include a computer not shown in the that may transform the raw prescription data to a format such that it may be integrated with the patient s EHR in the E EHR E EMR facility .

The prescription may be received by an RX validation and selection facility either directly from the prescribing facility or over the backbone network to which the RX validation and selection facility may be communicatively coupled. The RX validation and selection facility may be configured to receive send real time event tracking data with other patient medical related facilities. Further the RX validation and selection facility may also obtain information regarding the patient including the past medical history of the patient treatment outcomes for the patient from past or current treatments allergic reactions to certain types of drugs and similar kinds of information. The RX validation and selection facility may thus embody various features to ensure improved probability of selecting and delivering the appropriate medication to the patient such as modules for identifying patient allergies or sensitivities modules for identifying potential interactions among medications prescribed or proposed to be prescribed and modules that use information or insights derived from the outcome module such as to propose medications that have produced favorable outcomes in other similar patients.

In an exemplary case the RX validation and selection facility may be a pharmacy facility and may include the services of a pharmacist to validate the medical prescription of the patient. In another exemplary case the pharmacist may be provided with a graphical user interface for performing validation of the medical prescription. Further in such an interface a user may utilize various buttons list boxes and text boxes for viewing entering and managing data such as patient data medication data outcome data and order entry data. In order to confirm the validity of data entered the software underlying the graphical user interface may validate the entered data such as for proper format and for the absence of various problems such as unfavorable interactions with other medications conflict with patient allergy information indication of a likely unfavorable outcome deviation for standards such as in units prescribed frequency of prescription or the like .

By way of example once the RX validation and selection facility has received the medical prescription and the other details and information about the patient the RX validation and selection facility may verify formulary compliance determine drug allergy information associated with the prescribed drugs and confirm the drug interaction information associated with the prescribed medication. The RX validation and selection facility may issue alerts or warnings to the pharmacist the healthcare specialist entering the medication order on a patient by patient basis to provide an opportunity for the prescriber to consider the prescription in light of these warnings and potentially make adjustments in the prescription before the RX validation and selection facility accepts the order into its processing facilities. After these activities have been accomplished and after reviewing all the relevant patient information a pharmacist associated with the RX validation and selection facility may validate the patient medical prescription. This pharmacist based validation may be done as a manual confirmation that follows a series of automated validation steps as described herein. The RX validation and selection facility may communicate the validated prescription of the patient to other facilities of the HPDMA via the backbone network .

In an embodiment of the invention the validated prescription from the RX validation and selection facility may be raw validated prescription data associated with the patient. The raw validated prescription data may not be in a format that may be integrated with the E EHR E EMR facility . The RX validation and selection facility may include a computer not shown in the that may transform the raw validated prescription data to a format such that it may be integrated with the patient s EHR in the E EHR E EMR facility .

After the prescription has been validated the validated prescription may be received by the dispensing and marking facility . The validated prescription may be received with associated information regarding formulary compliance drug allergy information drug interaction information brand versus generic prescription requirements non active ingredients of generic medications costs and inventory information related to the medication and the like. The information may be provided via a user interface which is accessible on a work station or maybe sourced from other facilities or data sources such as through the backbone . The dispensing and marking facility may receive the validated prescription and the associated information in real time from the communicatively coupled back bone network . In an exemplary case the dispensing and marking facility may be a pharmacy or may include automated dispensing and labeling machines within a pharmacy. Although as with all facilities described herein this facility or portions thereof may be coded instructions executed by various processing and or computing means disclosed herein. Further the dispensing and marking facility may prepare the medication order according to the validated medication and may associate certain relevant data with the medication orders. The associated data could include patient identification information the facility in which the patient resides or receives care locations within the facility such as wing floor room and the like patient insurance information facility personnel associated with responsible for the patient administration frequency and the like. The patient related information e.g. patient attributes events may be received either electronically via interfaces with other systems e.g. through the backbone or via manual inputs.

The dispensing and marking facility may determine which medication to dispense based on the prescription the frequency of administration and the like. In an example based on inventory availability the dispensing and marking facility may apply business rules to select a medication that results in a different frequency of medication administration. The dispensing and marking facility may also take into consideration patient care factors such as sleeping hours daylight and the like to determine a time date for each administration of the medication. This may be called administration frequency type. In an exemplary case a frequency type is related to how many times per day a medication is to be administered for example twice a day or three times a day. Because a day may be defined as the waking hours of the patient a prescription that has a frequency type of 3 times per day may result in prescription administration times of 7 AM 4 PM and 11 PM. For a patient that prefers to sleep later than 7 AM the administration times may be set to 9 AM 5 PM and 12 AM. Of course other frequency types and administration schedules are possible. Another type of frequency may include set intervals such as every 120 minutes every 4 hours etc. Set interval frequency types may be adjusted based on the time that the patient is awake the time that a care provider would normally be administering medication locally to the patient and the like. It may be important to note here the difference that exists in the two exemplary cases mentioned above which is illustrated by the example that every 12 hours is not the same as twice per day where the day is defined as the waking hours of the patient. Therefore the methods and systems described herein are able to take into account a particular treatment s Times of Administration TOA which typically varies across different treatments patients environments and the like. In embodiments a TOA pattern is determined based on observation of outcomes using the outcome module in particular to determine the influence of different TOA patterns on patient outcomes for a particular medication given to patients of particular types over time.

Further the dispensing and marking facility may communicate the medication orders and the data associated with it to a medication dispensing machine. A medication dispensing machine may dispense and pack the medications. In an example the communication may be in HL 7 format. The medication dispensing machine may be similar to the dispensing packaging and bar coding systems currently commercially available such as PEARSON MEDICAL S iPACKT60 TRADEMARK . Such machines are able to receive instructions regarding the medication to be dispensed grouping of the dispensed medications and labeling or marking of the packaging for the dispensed medications. Such machines also package the dispensed medications. Such packaging may include bar coded pillow packs for the patient. Further the dispensing machine may be located remotely. The remote dispensing of prescriptions may be supported by automated dispensing machines such as in facility kiosks third party home delivery chains and the like. The remote dispensing may include security to ensure proper authentication of the recipient through means like identifiers passwords finger scan and the like.

Further the medication dispensing machine may package the dosages according to instructions from the dispensing and marking facility and is able to package the dosages according to data associated with the medication order for example information related to the patient s identity the time of administration the facility in which the patient resides or receives care locations within the facility such as wing floor room and the like patient insurance information facility personnel associated responsible for the patient and administration frequency. The dosages may be packaged in packaging comprising human and barcode information regarding the particular dosage of medications. Different dosage of medications for the same patients may be grouped together in the same package resulting from instructions to associate a patient s medication by patient identifying information the facility in which the patient resides or receives care locations within the facility such as wing floor room and the like patient insurance information facility personnel associated responsible with the patient administration frequency and the like.

Further the medications packaged for a single dose may be labeled with the barcode which may be a conventional bar code or an advanced bar code such as having graphical elements human readable elements holograms 2D or 3D features or the like. Identification information may also be embodied in a physical tag such as an RFID tag or a chip such as used in a smart card providing enhanced tracking functionality when coupled with an appropriate reader or scanner. Such RFID chip and similar hardware embodiments should be understood as encompassed throughout this disclosure where barcodes and similar identifying marks are described herein. In an example the single dose packages may be referred to as pillow packs. The barcode or other identifier may uniquely identify the patient the prescription information the medication to be administered and general dosing rules and guidelines. The generation of this information may be automatic and may be assembled from information received at the prescription management facility such as the information received from the prescribing facility . Further the information may be prepared for use by the marking machine in the prescription management facility and the information may include data received from the E EHR E EMR facility . Further in an example a pillow pack may be limited such as to no more than for example three different medications so a patient may have more than one pillow pack for an administration of medication. The pillow packs may be prepared and or delivered individually for each administration for all administrations in one day in a three or four day supply in a 30 60 90 day supply and the like. In one preferred embodiment each administration of medication as planned by a prescribed TOA pattern is packaged into a single pillow pack or similar package so that the probability of the patient selecting the wrong medication or the wrong amount of medication is reduced.

Further the dispensing and marking facility may communicate with a plurality of dispensing locations and signal the locations to dispense specific medications. The signaling to the locations may be based on a variety of factors including immediacy of the need for the medication geographic proximity availability and cost of transportation. The medication dispensing and marking facility may further recognize the category and composition liquid solid etc. of the to be dispensed medication and route the dispensing to the appropriate dispensing mechanism. The labeling information may also be routed automatically to the appropriate marking system. Further the HPDMA may have the ability to keep track of the dispensed medications based on the proposed time of administration patient details and location of the patient e.g. in patient resident day patient emergency room clinic third party facility residential home personal address and the like . The information may be used to assist in the accurate and efficient packaging of the medications and treatments to be delivered to the correct location. Once delivered as described below the HPDMA may have the ability to electronically read the information from the packages of medications and treatments and confirm receipt by the appropriate personnel at the designated location.

After the prescribed medication has been properly packaged and instructions have been marked on it the dispensed medication may be sent for delivery. The RX delivery facility may be utilized for delivering the dispensed medications. It should be noted that the portions of the computerized pharmacy services disclosed in co pending U.S. Nonprovisional patent application having Ser. No. 10 134 293 filed Apr. 29 2002 entitled CENTRALIZED PHARMACY BUSINESS METHOD the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference may be utilized in providing orders to customer facilities. The HPDMA may support loading the packaged prescriptions into medication carts. Carts may be associated with particular care facility location properties such as a particular facility a floor in the facility a wing of the facility etc. In this way the packaged dosages having the readable information thereon regarding the location of the patient or the cart in which the dosage should be stored provide for easy and efficient loading of the cart. The RX delivery facility may also communicate in real time with the backbone network and may communicate the delivery details of the medication to other facilities of the HPDMA via the backbone network .

Also because the dosages are packaged according to the relevant associated data as described above rather than simply in a 30 day supply per drug per patient as is the conventional case the HPDMA may allow users to select the duration of supply. In an example the medications packaged according to the above disclosure may be provided in shorter supplies than the typical 30 day supply. While the duration of supply could be of any time duration supplies for two to ten days may result in significant cost savings by eliminating the amount of drugs that need to be returned or destroyed due to stopped or changed orders.

Further the prescription management facility may be in communication with an automated dispensing cabinet ADC on the premises of a healthcare facility. The HPDMA may perform the functionality described above and may instruct the ADC to dispense drugs once released.

The prescription management facility may perform similar functions as those described above with the alternative or additional functionality of being able to provide healthcare facility professionals with the information necessary to dispense medication from their own medication stores. Thus there may be a medication storage device or automated dispensing cabinet ADC on a healthcare facility s premises and in addition to the facilities described above a medication supply interface. The prescription management facility may be in electronic communication with the medication supply interface and may provide notification which may be output through the medication supply interface that the medication is approved for administration and whether the medication is in the medication storage device. The medication management facility may be kept constantly up to date with regard to the inventory of the medication storage facility by the ordering and administration functions described herein.

The elements within the area shown in may be collectively referred to as a prescription management facility and may include the RX validation and selection facility the dispensing and marking facility and the RX delivery facility . The prescription management facility may include other facilities as well and may not be restricted to only these three facilities. The prescription management facility may include or use an information technology infrastructure such as including one or more software applications data storage facilities and the like that may be accessible via an electronic communication link such as the Internet or other network such as any type of network described herein.

Once the medication is delivered to the desired destination it may be administered. The administration of the medication may be conducted at the prescription administration facility . The prescription administration facility may facilitate proper administration and real time data capture of prescription administration information. The prescription administration facility may utilize technology enabled devices such as handheld barcode scanners smart card chip readers RFID readers hologram readers or other devices in certain preferred embodiments used in proximity to the patient at the point and time of administration thereby increasing the probability that data about administration accurately reflects real events. Such devices may automatically read the coded information associated with the medication. Such devices may communicate with other portable computing devices such as smart phones PDAs laptop computers or other devices having a facility to enter data. The portable computing devices and or the scanners are in communication with each facility described herein in connection with . At the time of data collection the use of handheld barcode scanners combined with contemporaneous entry of patient data often prompted by the system at the time of scanning as will be described below may allow real time capturing of information about the events associated with and immediately after administering medications. The handheld barcode scanner may also allow obtaining of the real time data and contextual information for the person performing the administration. In an exemplary case the person performing the administration may be a patient nurse technician physical therapist or some other care provider. Further the prescription administration facility may access or communicate with a data center that may provide information from any of a variety of medical information related sources. Examples of data centers that provide relevant medical information may include E EHR E EMR outcome databases third party databases any of the facilities depicted in and the like. In an exemplary case such access may typically be through a wireless connection between a technology enabled device being used in association with administration and a server or other networked device. Further the prescription administration facility may be communicatively coupled to the backbone network and may communicate the administration details in real time to the other facilities via the backbone network . The prescription administration facility may include an integration facility for automatically integrating data that may be captured in context of prescription administration and that may be related to a medically related event healthcare related events patient health condition data patient physical activity data patient treatment data patient oral consumption data patient visitor data patient outcome data patient psychological data patient vital signs patient dietary and nutritional data and the like for establishing or maintaining a patient s health record in association with the E EHR E EMR facility . In an embodiment of the invention the data captured in context of prescription administration may be referred to as medication administration data. The prescription administration facility may also prompt a user of the technology enabled prescription administration facility device to enter into the portable computing device or the scanner for example information associated with administration of the dosages of medication and also to verify that a dosage has been administered to the patient.

In an embodiment of the invention the medication administration data from the prescription administration facility may be raw medication administration data. The raw medication administration data may not be in a format that may be integrated with the E EHR E EMR facility . The prescription administration facility may include a computer not shown in the that may transform the raw medication administration data to a format such that it may be integrated with the patient s EHR in the E EHR E EMR facility .

Further the prescription administration facility may facilitate providing bedside prescription administration that may further facilitate capturing all caregiver observations and clinical events performed as part of the prescription administration. The data associated with the caregiver observations and clinical events performed may be captured in real time at the bedside as described above or may be captured later from notes taken or entered into the system by the caregiver. Further because the information is collected at the bedside the prescription administration facility may collect information that may not directly relate to the prescription administration activity. Such information may alternatively be obtained by the patient attribute and events facility . The information may be collected using sensors. In an example the sensor may be an accelerometer or motion detector that detects patient movements such as standing walking and the like. As will be described elsewhere herein the information may further be utilized to populate an E EHR E EMR facility in real time.

Further in an embodiment of the invention the medication administration facility may include a sensor that may detect opening of a pillow pack of the medication or a bottle of the medication or any other container containing the medication. In an embodiment of the invention the sensor may be able to identify the geo location of the medication package at the time the medication package is opened. Further the detected location may be recorded in the E EHR E EMR facility . In an embodiment of the invention the information about the detected location may be transmitted by the sensor over a wireless network. In an example the wireless network may be a WiFi network. In another embodiment of the invention the information about the detected location may be communicated through near field communication to a handheld scanning device being used in the medication administration events. In yet another embodiment of the invention the information about the detected location may be communicated through near field communication to a mobile device being used in the medication administration event. Further in embodiments of the invention the information about the location of the medication package at the time the medication package is opened may also be recorded manually at the time of administering that medication to the patient.

The bedside administration may further allow collecting data associated with elderly patients and patients in LTC. This data may include without any limitations psychiatric and psychologically relevant observations along with physical data. In an example when an elderly patient has undergone a heart surgery the elderly patients tend to go into depression or display symptoms of psychosis that may be caused by or exacerbated by an administered medication. As the HPDMA allows bedside data collection of prescription administration and treatment of the patient the data related to the mental state of the elderly patient or the patient in the LTC may only be relevant if they are recorded by observing the patient a significant amount of the time to allow observation of changes. Further this data may be recorded in the electronic health record of the patient by the E EHR E EMR facility . Further this data may be used as early indications of a related condition of depression or psychosis and may facilitate the prescription of additional medication or assigning of other therapies known to prevent deterioration in the nascent symptoms. In embodiments the psychological observations may be associated with TOA information so that patterns in psychological effects of medication administration can be observed and tracked such as using outcome module .

Further at the time of administration the administering professional using the HPDMA may scan the medication barcodes which may populate various fields in the administration facility that may be displayed on a screen by or on the administration facility for verification and or manual completion. Alternatively or in conjunction with the scanning data that may relate to the patient care facility care giver environment observations and the like as well as data relating to the administration may be entered into the administration facility such as through a user interface. In an embodiment of the invention the handheld scanner scanning the medication barcodes or other health monitoring devices providing the patient s health condition data may generate a location data corresponding to the medication that is being administered to the patient. In an embodiment of the invention the location data may be generated by utilizing the Global Positioning System GPS facility embedded in the handheld scanner or other monitoring devices. Once the information is entered and prior to administration the information is communicated to the medication management facility . If current information in the medication management facility shows that there has been a change to the patient s medication a stop order or the like may be communicated to the administration facility and displayed via the interface on the technology enabled administration device to the prescription administrator. In this way the HPDMA may prevent the administration of discontinued medications and ensure that the correct medication and dosage is being administered at the right time. The HPDMA might require the caregiver to uniquely identify themselves using a plurality of identification methodologies. The collected identification information may be validated recorded and stored to ensure compliance with regulations and provide tracking information for the caregiver that administered the treatments or care.

Further the prescription administration facility may include a therapeutic equivalent facility which may accept electronic medication orders and suggest therapeutic equivalents. Drug products classified as therapeutically equivalent may be substituted with the full expectation that the substituted product may produce the same clinical effect and safety profile as the prescribed product. Drug products may be considered to be therapeutically equivalent if they meet criteria such as they are pharmaceutical equivalents contain the same active ingredient s dosage form and route of administration and strength. they are assigned by FDA the same therapeutic equivalence codes starting with the letter A To receive a letter A the FDA designates a brand name drug or a generic drug to be the Reference Listed Drug RLD and assigns therapeutic equivalence codes based on data that a drug sponsor submits in an Abbreviated New Drug Application to scientifically demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent i.e. performs in the same manner as the Reference Listed Drug . The therapeutic equivalent facility may contain a library of such therapeutic equivalents and suggest them to the prescribing professional upon order entry based on for example whether the proscribed medication is on the patient s insurance formulary.

Further the HPDMA may utilize the patient s information including but not limited to age sex medical condition current diagnoses and past medication history to guide the caregiver in administering medication. Such information may in various embodiments be provided with security to render it anonymous such as for compliance with regulatory requirements relating to patient privacy.

The prescription administration facility and the prescription management facility may allow capturing of the information about the medications that may be prescribed but not administered. Such cases may occur when a medication is prescribed but the prescription is not filled or when the prescription has been filled in the pharmacy but then the caregiver decides not to administer that medication or the patient declines to take the medication. The reasons for not administering the medication may include without any limitations that patient feels better and does not require the medication that the patient identifies that the side effect of the medication is too risky and hence declines the medication that the caregiver decides on a different medication or the like. For example if side effects of the medication include an upset stomach and the patient already has an upset stomach the caregiver may conclude it does not want to exacerbate that side effect with medication.

Further once the medication is dispensed and the doctor or the physician determines that a different medication is required for the patient some of the original medication goes unused. In such a case the status of the unused portion of the used medication gets updated in real time in E EHR facility . The insurance and payments facility may obtain the information associated with unused medication from the E EHR facility to revise the billing accordingly. The pharmacy inventory status may also be updated with information regarding the unused medication and the unused medication may be returned back to the pharmacy or destroyed. The medications for a patient in LTC or other in patient care facility may be dispensed from the pharmacy for one dose at a time to avoid wasted medication or handling medications that may be returned to the pharmacy. Thus in certain preferred embodiments the HPDMA may track non administered medication such as for outcome tracking payment reimbursement and other purposes.

The HPDMA may further include the patient attributes and events facility . The patient attributes and events facility may monitor change in patient s attributes in response to the prescribed medication. These changes may be communicated to other facilities via the backbone network . The patient attributes and events facility may further track the events associated with the patient after consuming the prescribed medication. These events may be communicated in real time to the other facilities via the backbone network . Further the changes in the events and attributes of the patient may correspond to treatment outcomes. Further the patient attributes and events facility may obtain the information collected at the bedside by the prescription administration facility . This information may include without any limitation on what side the patient is lying how many times the patient has turned his side the position of the patient changes in the position of the patient changes in the body position of the patient changes in the movement of the patient whether the patient is walking or standing or sitting or sleeping what the patient ate or consumed whether the patient sleeping or awake how much did the patient eat how much did the patient drink how much did the patient excrete and the like. The information may further be associated with the caregiver and may include without any limitations changing or dressing the bandages of the patient and the like. The monitoring of the patient s attributes and events may provide various types of data including but not limited to patient health condition data patient physical activity data patient treatment data patient outcome data patient psychological data and the like. Further the various types of data may be recorded by the E EHR E EMR facility .

In an embodiment of the invention the various types of data from the patient attributes and events facility may be raw format and may include raw patient health condition data raw patient physical activity data raw patient treatment data raw patient outcome data and raw patient psychological data. The raw format of the various types of data may not be in a format that may be integrated with the E EHR E EMR facility . The patient attributes and events facility may include a computer not shown in the that may transform the raw format of the various types of data to a format such that it may be integrated with the patient s EHR in the E EHR E EMR facility .

The outcome events facility may then obtain the outcomes of the patient s attributes and the events. The outcome events facility may store the obtained treatment outcomes and may also communicate them in real time to the other facilities of the HPDMA via the backbone network .

Further the medical event streams on the backbone network from different facilities of the HPDMA may be utilized to populate the E EHR E EMR facility . The medical event stream may include outcomes from prescription management events healthcare planning events laboratory events medical payment events and treatment outcome events.

The E EHR facility may be associated with other facilities as depicted in and may exchange information e.g. real time data with these facilities. The E EHR facility may maintain a collection of health records of an individual and or a group of individuals in a format that may be capable of being shared across different medical facilities of the HPDMA or with external facilities. In an exemplary case the health records may be shared electronically through the Internet and the like. Further an E EHR may include any related medical data and information such as medical history allergies pathology and laboratory test results medical scanning reports region and residential information psychological data and the like.

Further the E EHR facility may encompass information related to all the facilities of the HPDMA including administrative nursing lab clinical radiology pharmacy care planning imaging insurance planning facility planning rehabilitation and the like. An electronic communication interface may be provided for implementing receipt information by the E EHR facility from the backbone network and providing the information from the E EHR facility. Such an electronic interface may thereby facilitate utilization of the E EHR related information anywhere within the HPDMA . For example lab reports of a patient stored in an E EHR facility may be utilized during care planning to prepare a healthcare plan for a patient. Similarly patient data related to allergies and sensitivities may be utilized by a doctor to prescribe relevant medicines and offer treatment accordingly. Further an E EMR may be generated in association with the E EHR facility and may be useful in an institution such as a hospital clinic physician s office nursing home center and the like.

Once the data from the medical event streams on the backbone network has been stored in the E EHR E EMR facility the medical data may be utilized by various other facilities of the HPDMA . The outcome facility may obtain the treatment outcome events from the E EHR E EMR facility . The outcome facility may utilize the electronic interface of the E EHR E EMR facility to obtain the treatment outcome data. Further the outcome facility may have a bidirectional communication with the E EHR E EMR facility .

The E EHR E EMR facility may also be coupled to the existing medical record facility . The existing medical record facility may include hard copy and or a database that may store the existing medical records of a patient or a group of patients.

The outcome database facility may be communicatively coupled to the outcome facility to obtain the treatments and outcomes for the medication being administered to the patients. The outcome database facility may include a plurality of databases that may store the treatments and outcomes data for a plurality of similar patients. The outcome database facility may also be communicatively coupled to the backbone network and may obtain treatments and outcomes data in real time. Further the outcome database facility may communicate the treatment outcomes of the patient to other facilities of the HPDMA through the backbone network .

Further the outcome database facility may be coupled to the outcome analytics facility that may utilize the treatment outcomes of the patient to generate medical reports medical predictions and other medical analyses. The outcome analytics facility may utilize the demographic information associated with the patient information regarding the administration of the medication and clinical outcomes and the like to generate the reports predictions and other analyses. The administration information may include the time of administration and the dose of medication. The output of the outcome analytics facility may be utilized by other facilities of the HPDMA . Further the outcome analytics facility may access the third party data to produce the reports and predictions. Third party data may include medical studies trials FDA related data orange book data and the like.

Further the outcome data may be utilized to determine the condition of the patient s health adverse event for a particular drug sampling of patients with an infectious disease monitoring of patient flow during an epidemic outcome of a clinical test and correlation of disease in case the clinical test is found to be positive or some other kind of outcome related to healthcare data. In this aspect the outcome analytics facility may include an analytic workbench facility that may provide different modules for conducting statistical analysis of the outcome data. Such an analytic workbench facility may implement one or more statistical techniques including but not limited to Analysis of Variance ANOVA Chi square test Correlation Factor analysis Mann Whitney U Mean square weighted deviation MSWD Pearson product moment correlation coefficient Regression analysis Spearman s rank correlation coefficient Student s t test Time series analysis Bootstrap Jackknife Resampling Statistical classification Statistical surveys Structured data analysis statistics Survival analysis Multivariate discriminant analysis Linear discriminant analysis Cluster analysis Principal component analysis and the like.

By leveraging the real time bed side data collection capabilities of the HPDMA along with support for accessing a plurality of enhanced electronic health records the outcome facilities e.g. outcome facility outcome database facility and outcome analytics facility may facilitate rapidly detecting an onset of an epidemic type situation. By combining outcome analysis with real time data it may be possible to identify patients infected with an infectious disease at the first screening. For example the various symptoms of an epidemic type disease may be stored in the outcomes database and a patient s real time symptoms may be captured and entered into the outcome analytics facility e.g. analytics workbench to facilitate identifying a patient with such a disease. Likewise the analysis capabilities of the analytic workbench may support regression analysis to facilitate determining genetic modification of a virus over a period.

Similarly real time event data may be associated with the outcome. The analytic workbench facility may perform statistical analysis to determine whether the occurrence of a specific event is significant to the outcome data. A feedback may be provided to the associated medical specialist in case the event is statistical and significant to a specific patient. The analytic workbench facility may be programmed to dynamically select the best algorithm in a specific situation. Alternatively the analytic workbench facility may include a GUI enabling the user to select the algorithm to be applied.

In association with the outcome analytics facility various machine learning techniques may be implemented using neural networks to improve on the analytics as well as to facilitate predicting outcomes. Various types of neural networks may be employed including learning algorithms reinforcement learning algorithms supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms. Further other techniques include genetic algorithms biological cybernetics biologically inspired computing cerebella model articulation controllers cognitive architecture cultured neuronal networks neural network software neuro fuzzy approaches neuroscience predictive analytics radial basis function networks recurrent neural networks self organizing maps simulated reality hidden markov models kalman filters decision theory support vector machines tensor product networks time adaptive self organizing maps time delay neural networks and the like.

Additionally the analytic workbench facility may utilize learning to train suitable techniques for optimum prediction. The prediction of a future outcome based in part on an earlier outcome may be an integral part of the analytic workbench facility. In this regard the analytic workbench facility may extrapolate data to identify future events associated with the patient and raise an alert to doctors about these future events. For example outcomes for a plurality of patients experiencing a range of symptoms who have been administered a drug may be used to predict an outcome of a patient with similar symptoms who may be prescribed a similar drug. This predicted outcome may include certain side effects that can be prevented with proper preventive treatment. Even if these side effects were not present in the FDA trials before the drug was allowed on the market the analysis of outcomes combined with other information collected by the HPDMA may facilitate predicting these outcomes in patients.

The machine learning techniques may utilize algorithms that may perform various data mining operations on the data such as classification clustering and other data mining techniques known in the art. To this end the effect of various drugs on a particular disease may be studied and an identification relating to the effect of the drug may be recorded. For example brand X may cause fewer side effects when administered to children than brand Y. Likewise in another example brand Y may be more effective in critical conditions. These analyses may help doctors and other medical staff to create a knowledge map for treatment under different conditions.

Machine learning may be performed by taking into account a weight that reinforces a particular outcome. An initial set of weights may be determined based on for example a prediction theory hypothesis or the like as to the importance of a particular factor or factors then adjusted by feeding actual outcomes into the machine learning system. For example the machine learning may initially append a weight X if the drug is believed to be suitable then adjust the weight based on actual outcomes as tracked in the outcome module . Likewise if the administered drug cures the patient slowly and subsequently allows the patient to recover completely a higher weight XX may be assigned by the machine learning algorithm. Similarly if an administered drug results in quick recovery then a much higher weight XXX may be assigned to the medication and or treatment by the machine learning algorithm. In an emergency situation the doctors may use outcome prediction based on machine learning techniques employed in the outcome analytics facility to confirm an initial diagnosis that may have been made by a field emergency medical technician. In certain preferred embodiments weights will be multivariate such as taking into account the medication the TOA pattern for the medication clinical treatment factors psychological observations and the like. Similarly the outcomes that are fed into the machine learning system may vary such as including extent and timing of recovery mitigation or exacerbation of side effects financial factors observation of satisfaction or psychological factors and the like.

Further clinical outcomes of the medication may be measured using indicators like but not limited to disease control risk reduction and health care analysis of the patient undergoing treatment. Clinical outcomes of a medication may also be measured using monetary terms by analyzing the economical perspective of the medication. The method for measuring clinical outcomes in monetary terms may include a determining the most appropriate clinical outcome of the medication b establishing monetary investment on achieving the most appropriate clinical outcome and thereafter calculating a financial value for the most appropriate clinical outcome as per the monetary investment for the medication.

The above calculated financial value may be an indicator of the cost benefit analysis of the medication. The financial value may be calculated for a drug treatments a medical facility a health care management solution a disease reduction program and the like.

The financial value may be employed as an indicator for ranking a medication a drug treatments a medical facility a health care management solution a disease reduction program and the like. For example there may be more than one effective medication that may be used to treat a set of diagnosed symptoms one of these may be more expensive than the other but equally beneficial with regard to alleviating symptoms of the patient. In this scenario the financial value may determine the selection of the medicine in order to provide the best clinical outcome for the dollars spent.

Other factors may be combined with the cost of medication to arrive at the most effective financial outcome in offering treatment. For instance factors such as a pharmacy management information system the prescription management facility the insurance and payments facility and the like may be combined to arrive at numerous alternative pharmacy management features. The insurance company may select a specific pharmacy management feature to reimburse the hospital or patient in the management of a particular disease. Validation of an RX may include the rating of the medication prescribed and that rating may influence the rate of reimbursement that may be dispensed by the insurance company. For instance one pharmacy management feature may include an RX with various factors such as expensive medications and additional therapies such as alternative medicine and psychotherapy that may be incidental to the patient s recovery another pharmacy management feature may include other factors that include less expensive but efficacious medications and only those therapies such as physiotherapy drug therapy and occupational therapy that may be most essential to the patient s recovery. In such a scenario the insurance company may have the option of preferring to pay for the RX that it considers most suitable for treating the patient and based on validation of the RX it may prefer to reimburse cost of the latter line of treatment and reject the former.

Further the output of the outcome analytics facility may be utilized by the rehabilitation and LTC facility to plan a long term care or the rehabilitation treatment for the patient. This planning may be based on the different parameters such as background needs of the patient medical equipment needs home healthcare environment needs nutrition supply commodities education training and the like. These parameters may be obtained from the reports and the predictions made by the outcome analytics facility . Further the rehabilitation and LTC facility may obtain real time medical event streams from the backbone network .

The output of the outcome analytics facility may further be utilized by the care planning facility . Care planning may include the planning of any aspect of patient care and may be based at least in part on data provided by an E EHR E EMR actual outcomes predicted outcomes and other analytics provided by the outcomes analytics facility . A physical rehabilitation facility manager may adjust a schedule of care takers and rehabilitation specialists based on the outcomes or predicted outcomes for patients being treated in regional hospitals. A nurse may be notified that a patient on her shift has recently started a medication that based on an outcome prediction will make the person thirsty so that the nurse can ensure that the patient has plenty of fluids available. These are only examples of a few potential care planning facility features and therefore are not representative of all of the features of the care planning facility .

As with all facilities described herein some of the facilities depicted in may be embodied as physical devices e.g. computers machines carts packaged medicine scanners and the like and some may be embodied as either software or a combination of software and hardware. In an example electronic order facility medication validation and billing facility may be embodied as one or more software applications executing on a processor such as a web server that is in communication with the other devices as depicted in .

The electronic order entry facility may include a user interface for aiding a health specialist to enter electronic medication orders and other prescription type orders. The user interface may be displayed on the validation workstation a prescribing facility as shown in any other electronic communication device e.g. a mobile phone a hand held prescription entry device and the like . The medication validation facility may use security type identification methods to uniquely identify record and document the person entering the orders. As described herein the medication validation and billing facility may be configured to facilitate verifying formulary compliance of the ordered medication s determining drug allergy information associated with the prescribed drugs confirming the drug interaction information associated with the entered electronic medication orders and other prescription validation inventory compliance checks billing compliance checks and the like. On the basis of any of these or other validation checks performed by the facility a signal may be sent to the source e.g. a workstation etc of the electronic medication order to warn the prescriber on a patient by patient basis. Such warnings may need to be resolved before accepting the order.

To facilitate compliance with pharmacy regulations and generally support a high degree of quality control a user interface accessible on the validation workstation may include a utility that may allow a pharmacist to approve the electronic medication orders after having reviewed all the relevant information. The approval of the electronic medication orders may also herein be referred to as releasing the orders. Further the medication validation and billing facility may associate relevant data to the released orders such as patient identifying information the facility in which the patient resides or receives care locations within the facility such as wing floor room etc. patient insurance information facility personnel associated responsible for the patient administration frequency and the like. The information regarding the patient may be received either electronically via interfaces to other systems e.g. as depicted in or via manual input e.g. through a user interface of the validation workstation .

After the medication order has been approved the medication validation and billing facility may communicate the released orders and the data associated therewith to a medication dispensing machine . In an example the communication between the medication validation and billing facility and the medication dispensing machine may be in HL7 format. The medication dispensing machine may also receive instructions regarding the medications to be dispensed how to group the dispensed medications and how to label the packaging of the dispensed medications . On the basis of the received instructions the medication dispensing machine may package the medications into individually packaged dosages. The medication dispensing machine may also package the dosages according to data associated with the order for example information related to the patient s identity the time of administration the facility in which the patient resides or receives care locations within the facility such as wing floor room etc. patient insurance information facility personnel associated responsible for the patient administration frequency medication cart number and the like. The dosages may be packaged in packaging comprising human and electronically readable information regarding the particular dosage of medications. Electronically readable information could in embodiments be bar coded although any other traceable marking or device may be employed RFID 2D code matrix code and the like . In an example the medication dispensing machine may package bar coded pillow packs for the patient. Further different dosages of medications for the same patients could be grouped together in the same package resulting from instructions to associate a patient s medication by patient identifying information the facility in which the patient resides or receives care locations within the facility such as wing floor room etc. patient insurance information facility personnel associated responsible with the patient administration frequency and the like.

Further in an embodiment of the invention the dispensed medications may be packaged and transported to a health care facility that may be local to the dispensing machine or may be remotely located. The dispensed medications may be transported e.g. on a medication cart into which the packaged medication dosages may be loaded from the dispensing machine to a health care facility. In an example the health care facility may receive a plurality of medication carts each of which may be associated with a particular location in the facility such as a particular facility a floor in the facility a wing of the facility etc. In this way the packaged dosages having readable information thereon that describe the intended location of the patient or the cart in which the dosage should be stored may provide for easy and efficient loading of a medication cart . The dispensed medicine may be automatically loaded onto one of the medication cards that may be located near the dispensing machine . Alternatively the dispensed medication may be transported in bulk to a distribution location e.g. a nurse s station or an in house pharmacy and loaded onto a medication card manually.

To facilitate management of medications stored on a medication cart a reader and a medication workstation may be used in the processing of medicine cart based dispensed medications . One or more user interfaces displayed on the medication workstation may support various work flow processes associated with medication dispensing transport delivery and the like. The reader and medication workstation may be used at any of a variety of events e.g. as defined by the work flows associated with the sorting distribution transport delivery unpacking administration and disposal of dispensed medications . In an example of remote sorting and medication cart loading a person may use a code reader to capture a marked code on a pillow pack of medication and select a medication cart loading work flow. The captured data may be transmitted e.g. over the internet to the medication validation and billing facility where it may be used to lookup medication cart loading instructions that may then be sent back to the medication workstation to be used by the person loading the medication cart . In an example of dispensed medication being transported in the medication cart a person may scan a label on the medication cart and select a transportation work flow. The scanned data may be communicated to the validation and billing facility which may respond with specific facility floor and wing information that may be displayed on the medication workstation . The person may use the displayed location information to forward the medication cart . Upon arrival of the medication card at the designated floor wing a person e.g. a nurse may scan the label on the cart again to signify that the cart has been received. Further in the example to begin delivering the individual medication dosages to patients on the wing a nurse may scan the cart label and select a final delivery workflow on the medication workstation . Although the exemplary embodiments described above include specific communications with the medication validation and billing facility some or all of these communications may be changed to support batch information transfer. For example when the medication cart is loaded near the medication dispensing machine a batch of data representing the loaded cart may be sent to medication workstation to facilitate autonomous handling of the loaded cart at the selected destination e.g. long term care facility . Other combinations of real time and batched communications are possible and are included herein.

Further the input facility may provide data provided to the analytics facility to analytics processing facilities that may include the analytic workbench facility or the machine learning facility . For example the input facility may provide a training data set to the machine learning facility for training the machine learning facility . In another example the input facility may optionally direct received outcome data to an outcome weighting facility .

In an embodiment of the invention the analytic workbench facility may predict an outcome of a medically related event by implementing one or more statistical techniques obtained from the analytic technique facility . The analytic technique facility may include without any limitation regression analysis iterative analysis complex modeling multivariable analytics Analysis of Variance ANOVA Chi square test Correlation Factor analysis Mann Whitney U Mean square weighted deviation MSWD Pearson product moment correlation coefficient Regression analysis Spearman s rank correlation coefficient Student s t test Time series analysis Bootstrap Jackknife Resampling Statistical classification Statistical surveys Structured data analysis statistics Survival analysis Multivariate discriminant analysis Linear discriminant analysis Cluster analysis Principal component analysis and the like. Depending on the type of prediction or analysis function that is to be performed by the analytics facility one or more of these techniques may be selected for use by the analytics engine. The analytic techniques facility may be a database of algorithms that may be accessible to the analytics engine facility .

Similarly real time event data may be associated with the outcome. The analytic workbench facility may perform statistical analysis to determine whether the occurrence of a specific event is significant to the outcome data. Feedback may be provided from the analytics facility to a caregiver in case the event is statistical and significant to a specific patient. In another embodiment the analytic workbench facility may include a feedback loop that may be utilized for correcting the output and or the outcome. For example the data provided to the analytics engine facility may have missing data the missing data may be fitted accordingly to the standard techniques known in the art. In addition the output may be fed back into the analytics engine facility for correcting the deviation of output to the actual output for example degeneration of virus may follow a Poisson s distribution rather than exponential distribution.

Further the analytic workbench facility may be programmed to dynamically select the best algorithm in a specific situation. Alternatively the analytic workbench facility may include a GUI enabling the user to select the algorithm to be applied. Additionally the analytic workbench facility may utilize the previous learning to train in suitable techniques for optimum prediction. In an embodiment the prediction of the future event based on the earlier event may be an integral part of the analytic workbench facility . In this regard the analytic workbench facility may extrapolate data to identify future events associated with the patient and raise an alert to doctors about these future events. For example administration of aspirin may reduce the phenomena of clotting in a patient however because of an emergency the drug aspirin may be administered to the patient. In this scenario the analytic workbench facility may alert the medical staff about the possible reduction in clotting of blood. The doctor operating upon this patient may be informed in advance in order to take remedial action.

In another embodiment of the invention a machine learning facility may be implemented using neural networks to produce the predicted outcomes. Various types of neural networks may be employed including learning algorithms reinforcement learning algorithms supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.

Further the machine learning facility may be used to perform various data mining operations on the data such as classification clustering and other data mining techniques known in the art. To this end the effect of various drugs on a particular disease may be studied and an identification relating to the effect of the drug may be recorded. For example brand X may cause fewer side effects when administered to children than brand Y. Likewise in another example brand Y may be more effective in critical conditions. These analyses may help doctors and other medical staff to create a knowledge map for treatment under different conditions.

In an embodiment machine learning may be performed by taking into account a weight from an outcome weighting facility that reinforces a particular result. For example the machine learning facility may apply a weight X in an outcome prediction if a drug associated with the prediction is found to be suitable. Likewise if the administered drug cures the patient slowly and subsequently allows the patient to recover completely a higher weight XX may be assigned to the outcome in the machine learning algorithm. Similarly if an administered drug results in quick recovery then a much higher weight XXX may be assigned to the outcome in the machine learning algorithm. In an embodiment both the analytics engine facility and the machine learning facility may be simultaneously utilized for predicting the outcome of the input data. For example the input data may be first passed to the analytics engine facility and subsequently to the machine learning facility for determining the predicted data. In another example the input data may be first passed to the machine learning facility and subsequently to the analytics engine facility for determining the predicted data.

In another embodiment a feedback loop may be provided in association with the machine learning facility to reintroduce a part of the predicted outcome data back into the machine learning facility . In this scenario the feedback loop may either be a positive feedback or a negative feedback reinforcing the outcome in the first case and damping the outcome in the latter case. In another embodiment the machine learning may be in the form of weighted feedback and the weights introduced in the feedback loop may determine the outcome of the predicted data.

Further in an embodiment of the invention after the caregiver has confirmed the medication displayed in area an area may get loaded automatically on the dashboard. The items in the area may include but not limited to the administration date the administration time the dose administered to the patient the medication prescription RX written for the patient the RX approved the information about first filling of the medication the information about last filling of the medication the delivery date of the medication and the like.

Further in an embodiment of the invention the dashboard may display an area to prompt the caregiver to enter information about the medication administration event. The entered information may include but not limited to administrator observations the details of the vitals associated with the patient the review of prior symptoms associated with the patient nay new symptoms after the medication was administered to the patient and the like.

Computer based or electronic order entry may guide doctors nurses and other authorized staff through quick and efficient electronic ordering of medication related treatment and clinical care services required by patients. The clinical care services may include diet nutrition therapy lab services and the like. This in turn may streamline the interaction between the pharmacy medication supply units and healthcare entities. Time consumed in placing the orders via conventional mediums such as phone calls and faxes may be reduced. In addition automated real time alerts and warnings may be issued regarding allergies clinical interactions dosage duration issues and generic substitutions. Further online help regarding medicines and regulatory compliance may also be offered by the system. This process may improve patient safety and reduce medication errors through increased order accuracy. Further less time may be spent on ordering and chasing down incomplete inaccurate or missing orders. Thus the time saved through use of an automated system may be utilized in better patient care.

Referring again to various facilities for managing and or tracking different prescription management events such as validation selection dispensing marking and delivery are depicted among several other facilities and features of the invention. A prescription management facility may include a validation selection facility a dispensing and marking facility and a delivery facility apart from other facilities as shown in . These facilities may be configured to receive send real time event tracking data with other patient medical related facilities. Real time tracked events from various medical related event streams may be utilized by the prescription management facility for real time and automated entries processing and checks. Medical event streams may include information from prescribing units care planning facilities laboratories imaging centers insurance payments units rehabilitation and long term care facilities electronic medical record repositories dashboards and databases third party sites healthcare facilities and the like.

The prescription management facility may include one or more interfaces that may facilitate entry of order data. Orders associated with the various prescription management services may be placed via any of several mediums including submitting an order form over the Internet accessing the interface through public and or private kiosks submitting orders e.g. prescriptions through mobile phones SMS and calls electronic fax system to system order transfer wireless portable devices e.g. dedicated prescription management devices and the like. For example a nursing home care provider secure website may be designed wherein orders for patients may be entered by physicians medical consultants nurses healthcare staff and the like. The prescription management interface s may be configured with security provisions that may restrict orders from being entered and or discontinued except by a nurse practitioner doctor or a specialist and not by any other facility staff or employee.

The prescription management facility interface may include a graphical user interface for order entry. In such an interface a user may utilize various buttons list boxes and text boxes for entering and managing order data. In order to confirm the validity of data entered the software underlying the graphical user interface may validate the entered data. For example if the age of the patient may only be recorded in numeric format JavaScript code embedded in the interface software may disallow the entry of non numeric data into the age field. Likewise other validation may be embedded into the graphical user interface to ensure the validity of the data.

Orders entered in the prescription management facility may allow selection and or verification of record through an interface such as GUI. As described above the validation and verification of order entered may be performed in real time during entry. For example a nursing home portal may contain patient profiles collected from various dashboards electronic medical records databases and the like. Access to the portal may require user authentication.

In addition to real time validation of order data entered into data fields of a user interface user authentication may be employed and may be provided in the form of login credentials encrypted passwords voice based authentication physical authentication biometric e.g. use of eye scan or finger prints and other types of user based authentication. To further ensure security of patient records an order entered by a medical practitioner may require authenticating the medical practitioner for a particular patient by validating other aspects such as referrals signed patient agreements to be treated and the like. In addition medical order entry may require selection of an order type through menus or tabs that may be enabled for the patient provider combination and may correspond to various parameters such as new orders admissions record prior authentication history allergies physician s orders and the like.

Validating a physician s orders may include requiring access to detailed information of the patient such as current diagnosis and orders discontinued orders allergies and reactions and the like. Although this information may be collected in real time from the prescription desk of the physician or medical consultant a judicious error free quick and responsive method of collecting such real time information may be aided by using patient identification ID numbers or codes. For example there may be approx. 250 patient entries with the name Allen Smith known to the pharmacy management facilities. However when Allen Smith s ID No. SYS2244 is used only the medical information that corresponds to a particular Allen Smith may be fed in to the prescription management system to access detailed patient information. Validation may rely on information in the selected profile e.g. the patient has been prescribed two dosage of Aspirin EC oral tablets and one dosage of Azathiocrine 50 mg tablets to be consumed once a day at 8 00 AM in the morning to help avoid potentially dangerous discrepancies in prescription management. In this example new prescription information e.g. received from a physician s hand held prescribing unit may indicate use of a particular drug however the existing prescription information may indicate potential adverse side effects due to this combination of medications. In such a case real time validated information may be sent to the physician s hand held prescribing unit as an alert to possibly adjust the prescription before the patient leaves the office. Alternatively the validated information may be sent as a reminder to a nurse at the time of administration to ensure that the proper precautions have been taken to allow the combination of medications in the patient.

The prescription management facility may rely on information received from prescribing units laboratories imaging units and the like to ensure a prescription is validated. The prescription management facility may affect correlation between the tests results dosage frequency high medium low and or efficacy of the prescribed drug for validation. For example data from imaging tests may indicate a very low bone density in a patient who has been prescribed high dosage of steroids for a problem unrelated to her bones. The correlation of the imaging data with the new prescription for steroids may indicate potential further deterioration of the patient s bone density therefore alerts and or reminders may be sent to the concerned entities e.g. doctor patients prescription management facility and the attendants regarding these potential damaging adverse effects.

Similarly real time information may be collected from third party sources pharmacy planning units regulatory databases and the like regarding the interaction effects and detailed reviews of various drugs and their interaction. This may be helpful in managing adverse reactions of various medicines on patients as well as educating informing healthcare professionals and doctors about new findings on the drugs and their interaction. This process may be specifically significant in cases where new drugs for chronic or pandemic diseases are prescribed consumed and tested. This may be explained with the help of the following example.

During a pandemic contagious virus spread a particular medication X may be prescribed. Real time information regarding the usage effects and disposal complete medication cycle may be collected and analyzed by the pharmacy planning and regulatory units. Data may be collected from nursing care centers hospitals patient responses clinics and the like that indicates that this medicine X results in certain side effects such as nausea diarrhea and extreme body ache. Clinical trials and analysis may recommend that these side effects are suppressed if the medicine X is supplemented with medicine Y. Information from clinical trial laboratories may be sent in real time to the various facilities including validation and selection facility of the prescription management facility. Upon validation of the order entry form for a patient a safety check may be conducted to ensure that medicine X and medicine Y are prescribed together for any reported case of the above disease. Thus the validation and safety checks may be in real time and actionable.

The prescription management facility may also include automated insurance coverage checks. Information regarding the patient s insurance plan medicines and treatments covered under that plan and payment option details may be accessed in real time by the prescription management facility . Verification of insurance information may be significant since coverage of patients within any particular insurance company may vary. As shown in event information from insurance planning and insurance and payments facilities may be collected in real time and shared with the prescription management validation and selection facility . The prescription management facility may validate that a medication being prescribed to a patient is covered by the patient s policy with the insurance company to avoid use of non covered medications that may result in phenomenally high expenses for the patient.

In another example information regarding the validity and payment details for a patient s insurance policy may be shared with the medication facility. In case the last premiums have not been paid the patient or his her caretakers may be informed regarding the same. In certain cases provisions may be made to facilitate payments from the closest kiosk within the healthcare facility.

The prescription management facility may also include automated insurance claims processing checks. The information for prescribed medications or indicative symptoms of a disease may be shared with the insurance processing and payment facility. Other information that may be shared may be frequency and duration of the treatment professional information of the surgeon or healthcare percentage of payment to be borne by the insurance company and the like. This information may be automatically compared by the prescription management facility with information supplied by the patient and any discrepancy between the two may be reported. This automatic process may speed up the portion of the prescription management cycle related to insurance claims processing.

In an embodiment the system may select and validate order information for various information fields such as order type medication dosage frequency day s supply dispensing quantity special instructions physician information etc. This information may be significant in facilitating automated medication dispensation processes. For example it may be pertinent to correctly calculate the day s supply of medication and its dispensing quantity based on the total length of the physician s prescription.

Duplication of orders may be recorded in real time. In response to any duplicate entry of order an error message may be displayed alerting the user of a duplicate entry. Order information may also be validated for possible duplicate orders.

The prescription management facility may include inventory management capabilities in that the system may match a prescribed drug with the pharmacy inventory. Discrepancies such as low inventory unavailability of a drug or its substitute and the like may result in an order for this particular drug being prepared. Through proper inventory management a medication dispensing process associated with the pharmacy management facilities may be a just in time dispensing process that may judiciously assess the quantity and time of delivery for orders. For a healthcare facility the orders may also be dispensed as per the internal organization or layout. For example separate orders may be prepared for separate floors e.g. ground first second etc. or by nursing station pediatrics dental gynecology etc. or by type of patients inpatient or outpatient wards Such an automated medication dispensing process may reduce the dispensing time required mitigate financial risk and administrative burden from unused quantities and minimize wastes and unnecessary expenses thereby providing an efficient system capable of meeting patient needs.

Automation accuracy and efficiency may be enhanced with bar coded patient medicine packs that may be utilized in combination with technology enabled medicine pack bar code readers by healthcare professionals e.g. nurses to administer and track in real time medications and treatments for each patient. The bar coded med packs may ensure safe proper and timely administration of drugs to patients. These bar codes may be read with the help of scanners camera based mobile phones or any other wired or wireless device with scanning or imaging capabilities. The data encoded in the bar code matrix code line code 1D code and the like may be a unique prescription identifier that also identifies essential attributes of the prescription. For example the code may include a unique prescription identifier and a unique dosage identifier. This information may be used to lookup further detailed information about the planned medication administration event such as the medication the dosage the time of administration the patient the expected location of the patient and the like. Alternatively more extensive information may be coded into the label or identifier that may include the patent name and ID for example to allow for manual or semi automated verification of the patient data by the nurse at the time of administration without the need of a network connection to a facility such as the prescription management facility .

The prescription management facility may handle automated refill orders and refill alerts to further improve prescription management efficiency.

The prescription management facility may include a therapeutic equivalent facility which accepts electronic medication orders and suggests therapeutic equivalents. Drug products classified as therapeutically equivalent may be substituted with the full expectation that the substituted product will produce the same clinical effect and safety profile as the prescribed product. In embodiments drug products may be considered to be therapeutically equivalent if they meet these criteria they are pharmaceutical equivalents contain the same active ingredient s dosage form and route of administration and strength. they are assigned by FDA the same therapeutic designates a brand name drug or a generic drug to be the Reference Listed Drug RLD and assigns therapeutic equivalence codes based on data that a drug sponsor submits in an Abbreviated New Drug Application to scientifically demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent i.e. performs in the same manner as the Reference Listed Drug . The therapeutic equivalent facility may contain a library of such therapeutic equivalents and suggests them to the prescribing professional upon order entry based on for example whether the proscribed medication is on the patient s insurance formulary.

Real time tracking of medical events may be facilitated with the help of a record system stored in a database. For this purpose one or more databases may be maintained such as a distributed database. A distributed database model may facilitate replication of data so that failure of one of the nodes may not affect the performance of the overall system fault tolerance and as a result the data may be available 24 7.

Data stored in the distributed database may be fragmented horizontally vertically or in a mixed mode i.e. involving both horizontal and vertical fragmentation for increasing the retrieval of data. For example the records for Pittsburgh may be horizontally fragmented and stored in one of the distributed database nodes located at Pittsburgh. By horizontally fragmenting the records corresponding to Pittsburgh the records for Pittsburgh may be placed in a database node located at Pittsburgh. Usually patients and doctors residing in Pittsburgh may be serviced from the database node located in Pittsburgh. Records corresponding to other locations may be also be maintained at each location that is a database node.

Data stored in the databases may include medical content in the form of prescription by a doctor surgical reports pathological tests patient s medical history and the like. While legacy data may be stored in the database for record keeping this data may be continuously updated with real time data received at the database from various other facilities. Further the database may be enabled to update information in real time. In an embodiment the database may be an OLAP Online Analytical Processing.

The database may include capabilities of transforming the data into a required format. For example data may be received from a number of facilities such as an MRI facility. This may require transformation to an acceptable format before it may be stored in the database. In this aspect the database may itself include software facilities for transforming data into an acceptable format. Alternatively data may undergo a transformation in a transformation facility for converting the data into a format acceptable for storing the same in the database.

The database may provide one or more streams to registered data users regarding medical events. For example an RSS feed may be provided and registered users may receive medical event data related to their patients latest trends in medical sciences drug developments administration of new drugs to patients and their outcomes and the like.

Data security may be ensured in the medical facility through authentication requirements. For example an entry for a record to be stored in a database may only be made upon proper authentication of a user along with an entry of his personal as well as log in details. In another embodiment of a fully automated tracking and record keeping database management system unique log in credentials may be provided to users who are registered with the medical facility and corresponding details of users are gathered and stored in a separate database once during registration. Any subsequent correspondence from a registered user may be accompanied with certain security checks to confirm already stored details of the registered users. Further various records of the database may be encrypted for a secured access by an authorized and intended person only. Encryption of the records of a database in the medical facility implements an authorization protocol that can be decrypted by a specific secured key only. In an embodiment a token may be issued to a user on any type of association with the database that may enable further processing and assist in track keeping of database communications. The token in an embodiment may be generated using an automated system in the form of an email.

The information stored in databases may be utilized for generating reports sheets updates and sending auto generated emails to intended recipients. Such reports updates and emails may be customized for a particular person or a section of people. Further such customized reports and emails may be generated periodically or on demand. The reports and emails may depict simple medical information in textual form for a period of time statistical analysis based on data forecasted details pertinent to healthcare medical suggestions and the like.

The pharmacy or medication unit may be either in house or remote. The in house pharmacy system may be an automated self service dispensing system that may be located in the vicinity of the healthcare facility. The system may be endowed with sufficient stocks e.g. 350 SKUs to meet immediate patient medication needs at any given time. In other cases remote pharmacies may interact with the healthcare facility via wired or wireless networks. The medications and the packaging may be supplemented with electronically readable information. The electronic machine readable information may be a RFID tag barcode optical disk and the like.

Remote dispensing of prescriptions may be supported by automated dispensing machines such as in facility kiosks third party home delivery chains and the like. Remote dispensing may include security to ensure proper authentication of the recipient through such means as identifiers passwords finger scan and the like. Further the medications usage from the dispenser may be tracked using tags scanners or sensors.

Similarly to integrated prescription dispensing facilities remote dispensing means may be able to detect nearly exhausted supply levels.

In accordance with embodiments of the present invention smart phones and other similar wired or wireless devices may be used for implementing the given invention. Similar to a web application the present invention when enabled on a smart phone or may be used for various functions for prescription management such as order entry safety checks and alerts insurance coverage checks and claims processing medication dispensation care planning and the like. Smartphone applications may take advantage of high resolution interfaces available on some smart phones. The interfaces may be graphical tactical touch based web based gesture based intelligent user interface motion tracking interface multi screen interface text user interface voice user interface and the like. A prescription management smartphone application may interact with various databases such as electronic medical records database regulatory database e.g. FDA laboratories and imaging database physician s health records and the like.

A smartphone application may alternatively be available for patient use and may be used to create medication alerts for a patient in real time. For example information about a patients purchase an over the counter generic drug may be captured in real time and sent to the prescription management facility where validation may determine that other prescriptions that the user it taking may result in a severe reaction to a composition in the purchased drug. This information may be immediately broadcasted in real time to the user s smartphone application or as an automated voice call and or a text message. In addition information provided in the alert may suggest substitutes that the user may purchase.

The prescription management facility may include a physician ordering facility that may capture prescription behaviors and or practices of a physician to help improve validation quality of prescriptions and the like. In an example a physician may routinely ask his nurse to submit prescriptions for him. The system may recognize that prescriptions coming from a variety of nurses in the doctor s office are all authorized by the same doctor and may use this information to automatically associate prescriptions from these nurses with this doctor.

In patient facilities hospitals nursing homes long term care residential rehabilitation centers and the like typically collect new patient information during a patient admission process. A pharmacy management facility may include built in capabilities to capture and or receive complete patient information from a facility admission module thereby reducing the opportunities for typographical or other human data entry errors. In addition admissions modules often automatically collect medical history information from the patient a representative or a medical record . This information can be processed through the built in admissions information sharing modules and presented in a form that is most useful to the prescription management dispensing and validation facilities.

The invention may further include a prescription administration facility to facilitate proper administration and real time data capture of prescription administration information. By utilizing technology enabled devices such as handheld or other devices at the point of administration important information about the events associated with and immediately after administering medications may be captured in real time. Such technology enabled devices may also benefit the administration process by providing real time data and contextual information for the person performing the administration e.g. a patient nurse technician physical therapist or other care provider . The prescription administration facility may access or communicate with a data center that may provide information from any of a variety of medical information related sources as depicted in . Such access may typically be via a wireless connection.

In an exemplary case the wireless connectivity may be Internet. In other exemplary cases the wireless connectivity may be WI FI WiMax Bluetooth Infrared and other similar types of wireless technologies. In an embodiment of the invention the wireless connectivity may be a secured connectivity. The security may be of different types including Wireless Encryption Protocol WEP WI FI Protected Access Pre Shared Key WPA PSK MAC address filtering and the like. WEP works by establishing a shared key between the clients network cards and the wireless router then using the key to encrypt and de encrypt the data passing between them. WPA PSK is a WI FI standard that improves upon the security features of WEP. To use WPA PSK a shared key or pass phrase is set. Using Temporal Key Integrity Protocol TKIP WPA PSK automatically changes the keys at a preset time interval thus making breach of security difficult. In MAC address filtering each network adapter or card wired or wireless has a unique number assigned to it called a MAC address. As a result if a wireless USB adapter is plugged into a computer it will show its own MAC address when connected to the Internet.

The technology enabled prescription administration facility may facilitate providing bedside prescription administration that may further facilitate capturing all care giver observations and clinical events performed as part of the prescription administration. The prescription administration facility may further provide step by step guidance and alerts for working with and providing care for patients. The prescription administration facility may further guide nurses through administering and documenting medication and treatment for each patient. Patient specific medication packs provided from the prescription management facility may include bar codes that may facilitate bedside verification for all medication and treatment at the moment of administration. As described herein the information captured on the bar code label or other identifier may include a unique dosage specific identifier that when presented to the prescription management facility can be used to lookup all of the essential patient information. Alternatively essential patient information may also be encoded in the identifier so that a caregiver may manually or semi automatically verify patient information without the need of a network connection to the prescription management facility . The prescription administration facility may also facilitate automatic collection of data for documentation of all medication and treatment administration activities using bed side readers scanner proximity detectors and the like. The bed side data capture facility may include a plurality of visual and or audible prompts to which a nurse or other caregiver may response to capture information that my not be readily captured automatically in all instances e.g. coloration of patient s skin condition of patient s hair and the like . In an embodiment of the invention the prescription administration facility may collect data that includes without limitations medically related event healthcare related events patient health condition data patient physical activity data patient treatment data patient oral consumption data patient visitor data patient outcome data and patient psychological data. Further the prescription administration facility may include a real time data integration facility that may provide integration of this collected data with the E EHR E EMR facility . In an example the patient health condition data may include the patient s vital signs collected automatically at the time of medication administration and or at other times such as through the use of wireless body monitors that may be in wireless communication with the HPDMA . In another example the patient physical activity data may include patient s position and movement facilitated by the caregiver and patient sleep data. In yet another example the patient treatment data may include bathing dressing wound care bed position adjustment physical therapy psychotherapy and patient position adjustment. In yet another example patient oral consumption data may include foods prepared for the patient and foods consumed by the patient fluids consumed by the patient and non prescription medications consumed by the patient.

The prescription administration facility may also collect medication administration data from coded information of the packages of medications for example the medication pillow packs. The medication administration data from the medication pillow packs may include patient identification information. The prescription administration facility may also collect data for the medication that was prescribed but not administered to the patient.

Further an electronic history of each activity and dosage for automatic anytime reporting and documentation may also be achieved with the prescription administration facility . To help with ensuring proper patient communication and care is provided by all care givers the prescription administration facility may access patient records to automatically display patient pictures medication pictures and additional information that may aid verification and prescription safety. The prescription administration facility may further provide 24 7 access to pharmacy experts through wireless connectivity capabilities described herein.

Further in an embodiment of the invention prescription administration facilities may include integration of the computing device with a scanner for scanning barcodes. The barcode scanning recognition technology may capture medication data patient data e.g. through scanning of a wristband or other identifier administrator data e.g. through scanning of the administrator ID badge and the like in real time and allow the caregivers to chart and maintain all critical patient information as they administer. At the time of prescription administration the administering professional using the prescription administration facility may scan barcodes which will populate various fields in the prescription administration tracking records. Alternatively or in conjunction with the scanning the data relating to administration may be entered into the prescription administration facility . In embodiments once the information is entered and prior to administration the information may be validated such as through communicating with the prescription management facility data servers. In an exemplary case the barcode scanner hereinafter the barcode scanner will be interchangeably referred to barcode reader may be a handheld scanner. The handheld scanner may have a handle and typically a trigger button for switching on the light source associated with the scanner.

The barcode scanner may work with different technologies. In an example the barcode reader may be a Pen type reader. The Pen type readers consist of a light source and a photodiode that are placed next to each other in the tip of a pen or wand. To read a bar code the tip of the pen moves across the bars in a steady motion. The photo diode measures the intensity of the light reflected back from the light source and generates a waveform that is used to measure the widths of the bars and spaces in the bar code. Dark bars in the bar code absorb light and white spaces reflect light so that the voltage waveform generated by the photo diode is a representation of the bar and space pattern in the bar code. This waveform is decoded by the scanner.

In another example the barcode scanner may be a laser scanner. Laser scanners work the same way as pen type readers except that they use a laser beam as the light source and typically employ either a reciprocating mirror or a rotating prism to scan the laser beam back and forth across the bar code. As with the pen type reader a photodiode is used to measure the intensity of the light reflected back from the bar code. In both pen readers and laser scanners the light emitted by the reader is rapidly varied in brightness with a data pattern and the photodiode receive circuitry is designed to detect only signals with the same modulated pattern.

In yet another example the barcode reader may be a Charge Coupled Device CCD reader. The CCD readers use an array of hundreds of tiny light sensors lined up in a row in the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of sensors lined up in a row a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a bar code is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself.

In yet another example the barcode reader may be camera based readers. The camera based readers use a small video camera to capture an image of a bar code. The reader then uses sophisticated digital image processing techniques to decode the bar code. Video cameras use the same CCD technology as in a CCD bar code reader except that instead of having a single row of sensors a video camera has hundreds of rows of sensors arranged in a two dimensional array so that they can generate an image.

In yet another example the barcode reader may be Omni directional barcode scanner. The Omni directional scanning uses a series of straight or curved scanning lines of varying directions in the form of a starburst a lissajous pattern or other multi angle arrangement are projected at the symbol and one or more of them will be able to cross all of the symbol s bars and spaces no matter what the orientation.

Further in embodiments of the invention the barcode scanner may be connected to the computing device via a serial interface a proprietary interface a keyboard wedge a Universal Serial Bus USB connector any wireless network and the likes.

To ensure proper prescription administration a variety of validity checks may be performed some of which have already been described herein. Information related to the prescription administration that may be validated include information such as the number of times the medication is to be provided to the patient in a day the dosage of the medication the details of the personnel associated or the responsible with the patient and the like. Validation may fail if any criterion established relative to these validation points is not met. In an example if a nurse scans a prescription medicine dosage pack for a patient but during validation the system determines that the patient has already received a maximum daily dose within the last 24 hours the system may alert the nurse to the potential overdose. This validation may be possible because the prescription administration facility may allow real time access to medical record information and prescription information provided by the prescription management facilities and other facilities as depicted in . Validation may also involve sending real time information collected during bedside preparation for administration to the prescription management facility to ensure that there has not been a change to the patient s medication that may impact the administration to be performed. In embodiments this is made possible by the real time connectivity between the relevant facilities of the system described in which in this case includes the prescription management facility and the prescription administration facility. If so a stop order or the like may be communicated by the medication management facility and displayed via an interface on the prescription administration electronic device. In this way the system may prevent the administration of discontinued medications and ensure that the correct medication and dosage is being administered at the right time. Under certain conditions the system might require the caregiver to uniquely identify himself or herself using a plurality of identification methodologies. The collected identification information may be recorded and stored to ensure compliance with regulations and provide tracking information for the caregiver that administered the treatments or care.

Data collected may include actual administration times drug administered dosage patient personnel who performed the administration e.g. to track when a shift change has resulted in a different nurse administering a prescription that the one who prepared it from the pharmacy or medicine cart timing and route of administration e.g. a refrigerated prescription may be dispensed from a refrigerated storage but may not be administered for several minutes or even hours due to limited staffing or large patient load or the like therapeutic equivalent considerations and the like.

The prescription administration facility may also provide alerts for the refills by scanning the barcodes. This alert may notify the pharmacy that a refill for a particular medication is required. Further the prescription administration facilities may calculate the expiry dates for the bulk items. A bulk item or non cycle medication is a medication that is not machine dispensable for each dosage the bulk items may include gels and creams. The scanning of barcodes may further provide the medications a list. The list may include information about which medication is to given at what time and the like.

Further in an embodiment of the invention the HPDMA may allow feeding of a Minimum Data Set MDS with the health status of each patient. The MDS for each patient may be coupled to the care planning facility to develop individual care plans that outline the appropriate interventions required to address specific ailments handicaps and other health care needs. In an embodiment of the invention the coupling may be achieved by integrating the medication administration record MAR of the patient into the MDS of the patient. Further a portion of the patient care plan may be devised using an interface associated with the prescription management facility . The care plan may provide a road map to guide all the caregivers who are involved with the patient or residents care. The MDS may provide a comprehensive assessment of each patient s functional capabilities and may help care providers e.g. nursing home staff to identify health problems associated with the patient. A list of deficiencies with the patient s overall health and well being may also be generated and recorded in association with the MDS. On the basis of the health problems a proper plan for the patient may be devised for resolving the health problems or improving the health of the patient.

The HPDMA may also allow measuring and tracking of the clinical outcomes for the patient which may allow devising of effective health care plans for the patient. Further a decision making tool may be provided to the health care specialist to design the health care plan for the patient. This decision tool may obtain data associated with the patient from the prescription management facility and the medication administration facility . The decision tool may also obtain anecdotal data and the narrative data provided by the nurses in the form of their notes and the ADL information. In an embodiment of the invention the decision tool may also capture the nursing notes directly from the MAR charts. Further clinical algorithms may be provided that may suggest changes in the patient s medication. These changes may include change in dosage of the medication change in the therapy and the like. These changes may be based on the clinical outcomes of the current medication and therapies administered to the patient. Further the different clinical outcomes may be for pain management treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers or bed sores disease specific behavior management related to using anti psychotic drugs or diabetes programs. Each type of clinical outcome may require focus and collection of different kinds of data associated with the disease and its outcome. Further each type of data may be data object for the MDS. The HPDMA may also provide different types of physiological sensors to populate data into the MDS.

The HPDMA may also allow tracking of the electronic ordering form for ordering the medication associated with the prescription management facility for populating the MDS. The MDS may record different types of prompts that may occur while filling up the electronic order form. The HPDMA may also allow tracking of the medication administration facility for populating the MDS. The MDS may record different types of prompts that may occur while administrating the medication to the patient. The prompts may include warnings and alerts. The HPDMA may also allow tracking of the documentation module for populating the MDS.

Further in embodiments of the invention the populated MDS may be combined with additional features to facilitate implementation of special instructions or to act as reminders. In an example a voice activated head set may be provided to the patient in LTC this headset may react to verbal inputs and record what is said aloud by the patient and this data may be added to the MDS. In another example a nurse alarm system may be provided to the LTC patient that alerts the nurse at a nurse station that the patient needs to be attended to. In yet another example wound management tools may be linked to the MDS. This wound management tool may be in the form of a mobile device application App that is able to scan the patient s wounds and the image may be transmitted to the health care specialist who may then provide advice on how to better manage the healing process of the wound. This application is useful in situations where the patient care facility is remotely located and the specialist is not readily available. In addition in some instances the second opinion of another medical professional may be required and in this event an App may be useful in transmitting real life images of the condition of the patient.

In yet another example the MDS may be linked with pain management tools. The relative intensity of the pain being felt by the patient who may be terminally ill may be recorded and transmitted to the MDS this data may then be accessed by the nurses and or attending doctors and the pain management medication may be altered accordingly. In this application the dosage of the pain medication will correspond exactly to the condition of the patient on that day and excess or inadequate dosages based on conditions recorded a few days ago may be avoided.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention data collection may be facilitated via automatically generated signals from tangible products such as medication supplies medicines bandages packets and the like nutritional food packages and the like. In embodiments the medication supplies and packages may be equipped with sensors RFID sensors tracking equipments and the like for detecting signals. For example opening a glucose bottle may send this information to a data collection facility for further processing. The information may include packaging date manufacturing or batch number manufacturer s name and code retail price and other similar details to the data collection facility. Similarly opening a packet of syringes or band aids may signal the event information to the data collection facility. In embodiments this information in combination with the location or spatial information such as GPRS information may be used for tracking complete real time event information.

Data may also be collected based on the observation recorded via a web or vigilance camera. The camera may be a mobile camera.

Data pertaining to events may be recorded such as a conversation between a healthcare professional and a patient. With proper technology enabled devices voice records may also be converted into digital EHRs.

Further data may be collected from existing patient records. In an embodiment data from manual hard copy records may be transcribed. In certain cases event dating may be provided to the transcribed data for the purpose of records.

In accordance with another embodiment data from E EHR E EMR facility may be accessed by other facilities such as care planning rehabilitation long term care facility and the like through an E EHR SaaS service.

Data in an E EHR may also be managed manually such as through a user interface. E EHR patient management user interfaces may be provided with various functional fields to add a patient discharge a patient and edit patient s demographics room number allergy diagnosis and the like information. In an example a change in the room number information for a patient may be sent in real time and updated in the patient s E EHR.

Various facilities may interact with each other such that the real time data flows among them. For example data from the administrative touch points such as from a hospital ward may be collected and shared with the other facilities such as care planning billing E EMRs and the like.

The flow of data may be bi directional between the facilities i.e. the data flow may be backward compatible. For example data sent from the patient s care department to the orthopedic department may reflect multiple incidences of fractures this information may indicate osteoporosis and a bone density test may be advised by the orthopedic department along with a blood test to the care department with instructions indicating fragility of patient s bones and advocating due care.

E EHR may include data that may be related to financial transactions such as billing payment insurance and the like. For example a patient may be undergoing a test in a laboratory. Real time information about the nature of test may be broadcasted to the billing facility where an automatic receipt may be generated indicating the amount to be paid by the patient based on the insurance coverage availed by him the insurance information may be obtained in real time from the insurance facility .

Similarly real time data from patient touch points such as patient attributes events facility may be utilized for various insurance processing activities such as determining submittal process and norms eligibility benefits coverage response and the like. Specifically for coverage response real time data from patient touch points may be used to ascertain events such as if a given treatment medicine is covered under an exceptional case or if it requires certain prerequisite events or conditions.

Likewise for payment options real time patient E EHR data may be used for establishing conditions or procedures for co payment and reimbursement for unused medications.

E EHR data collection may be related to new prescription events. In an embodiment data tracked in an E EHR for a new prescription by a doctor may include various aspects of the medications such as brands allowability for substituting generics dosage frequency quantity administration schedule and or requirements durable goods rehabilitation requirements treatment therapy and the like.

Data that may be stored with an E EHR E EMR facility e.g. in an E EHR may also be collected from electronic orange book maintained by United States Food and Drug Administration regarding new information on approved drug products generics proprietary name info applicants owners legal protection and therapeutic equivalents. This information when made available in a patient E EHR may be updated in real time and the updated information may be reflected in the markings on packaging of medications for example information regarding the mode of consumption sun exposure and the like may be printed on the label of a medication bottle.

Data pertaining to new events may be shared with the pharmacies and treatment and care centers such as long term care and rehabilitation centers. In addition the collected data may be used to manage dispensing supply chain operations at the pharmacy. For example a real time data collected for increased number of cases for stomach flu may help the pharmacy schedule its delivery side operations proactively. Similarly data pertaining to transactions for purchasing medications at the pharmacy windows may also be tracked.

Pharmacy related data tracking may include home delivery orders for a mail order pharmacy may be tracked and recorded in the E EHR in real time e.g. shipment from the pharmacy in route tracking delivery and the like 

The E EHR may also receive data pertaining to patient specific clinical outcomes from various sources such as laboratories imaging facility regulatory facilities third parties and the like. Outcome data may be provided electronically from computerized systems associated with the facilities or with an individual patient e.g. web based data entry by a patient . Clinical outcome data may include real time data collected from laboratory and imaging services such as tests requested intake notes medical samples electronic measurements clinician readings of results and notes primary or specialists care reading and notes and the like.

Patient touch points may include the facilities and facility in the healthcare management platform where real time event tracking concerning various aspects of medical care may be conducted. Personal records and documentation from these touch points may include information such as capacity planning number and details regarding people working in the facility time in and time out management for employees and staff and some other types of information

Clinical outcomes may be a form of patient touch point but other data from other patient touch points may also be captured by the E EHR E EMR facility . Patient interviews a common healthcare practice may include data that can be captured e.g. in real time and delivered to the E EHR or to other facilities as described herein . For example conversations between a patient and a rehabilitation specialist may be captured in the E EHR in the form of handwritten notes short hand writings graphical symbols voice recordings and the like . Likewise statistical information e.g. vital signs such as body temperature pulse rate blood pressure respiratory rate and the like may also be collected in real time from patient touch points. Collection of vital signs information may be a pre or post prescription administration activity.

Real time data collection from patient touch points may be used for improved pharmacy management in other ways including patient specific medication review when a prescription is received in the prescription management facility . As an example a patient s E EHR may indicate that the patient is being administered a daily dose of ranitidine for treatment of a peptic ulcer. The pharmacy management facility may receive a new prescription for the patient for nizatidine . The new prescription information may trigger the pharmacy management facility to retrieve the pertinent portion of the patient s E EHR to perform validation generic selection and the like based on this information along with the patient s condition s aptness and potential side effects of these medicines. The result may determine the course of prescription for the patient. Further real time patient response for different treatments and or medications may be stored as an E EMR record and may be used to provide feedback for pharmacy development. For example a response from a number of patients regarding taste of a medicine may be provided as a feedback to the concerned drug manufacturer.

E EHRs may be maintained for easy authentic and reliable access. In an embodiment the movement adequate storage requirements and storage location of health records e.g. in an E EHR or E EMR may be controlled to ensure that records may be accessed in real time and at any given time. E EHR maintenance may include a records recovery solution. Other E EHR maintenance activities may support audit trail periodic evaluation. Further various control measures such as access monitoring user verification authorized destruction and security controls may be introduced to prevent unauthorized access destruction alteration or removal or records and the like.

Because individual facilities may choose to maintain portions of patient records locally or at least maintain certain information separately from a comprehensive E EHR the E EHR E EMR facility may facilitate ensuring data integrity across all the records at all the locations. For example if a person changes his her contact address in the records of the care planning facility it may be validated through the E EHR E EMR facility to ensure that the information is accurate. The representative at the care planning facility receiving the new contact address information may confirm with the patient that this information should be applied to all of the patient s medical records before signaling to the E EHR to apply the change to the E EHR database.

Data from E EMR EHR may also be combined with other non E EHR data such as clinical studies drug interactions and company data and the like to facilitate a well informed decision process making by the concerned healthcare professionals and or entities. For example allergy information for a patient profile may be combined with the real time pharmacy information on substitutes to validate the prescribed medications for the patient.

When combined with other data E EHR data may be used in a variety of ways including creating prescription guidelines for physicians and the attendants determining the potential outcomes of a prescribed medication treatment administration. The potential outcomes may be useful for avoiding adverse medication s reactions or interactions customizing dose in accordance with patient perceptions identifying ineffective medications for particular patients identifying patient profiles for high effectiveness of medications treating co morbidity identifying unexpected benefits from unrelated conditions linking perceived actual benefits of medications to other factors and the like. For example a pain perception with medication administration may be dependent on other factors such as alertness physical activity entertainment mood and the like.

Further the E EHR may include information about a patient s daily life e.g. information on the nutrition activity exercise sleep patterns and the like which may be used during any subsequent patient touch point. The E EHR with this diversity of information including real time information as described herein may be useful for a more comprehensive assessment of the patient such as during an emergency by EMTs the emergency room nurses and other medical care professionals.

As discussed earlier E EHR E EMR data may also be useful for insurance planning Real time information regarding the purchase modification renewal of health policies for a patient may be updated in the records. Based on the records of an individual regarding his own and family s needs an insurance plan may be offered to him. Alternatively consolidation of E EHR data from a plurality of patients while maintaining confidentially of the patients may benefit an insurance planning activity that may relate to plans coverage rates costs payment processing and the like.

Real time health care data from electronic records e.g. EHR may be advantageous for management and operation of a long term care facility. Individual E EHRs may be accessed to determine eligibility for treatment in the facility specialists and or equipment that would be needed at the facility to support the individual and the like. Consolidated E EHR data may help with planning of facility expansion professional recruiting and the like.

In embodiments real time data from enhanced E EHRs may be utilitarian for a physician or specialist with regard to prescribing treatment and care. The dynamic real time nature of the E EHR E EMR facility and communications depicted in and described herein may benefit the use of remote specialist evaluation in real time of a patient that heretofore was unknown to the specialist by making the information in the E EHR current relevant and continuously updated through the real time updating capabilities described herein. In another example a doctor may be sensitized about the allergy conditions of a patient before prescribing medications to him her.

The E EHR E EMR facility may facilitate integrating data received from various facilities including dispensing marking facility Rx delivery patient events outcome events and the like. The data may be received by the E EHR E EMR facility through streaming data from these and other sources. This integration may result in further improved enhanced electronic records for patients.

Thereafter the data may be transformed to meet technical and business requirements of a target database. For instance word processing data might be translated into numbers and letters which are easier to track in a spreadsheet or database program. Finally data may be loaded into the target database. Some databases may overwrite existing data with cumulative effect with frequent updating of extract data being done on daily weekly or monthly basis. Further some databases may update the data in real time.

In an embodiment the E EHR may also be provided with a Statistical Analysis System SAS . The SAS may facilitate data entry retrieval management and mining of the data by the users. For example a user may enter information such as patient ID name of a patient and the like for retrieving details such as billing information medical history and the like about the patient from an E EHR. The retrieved data may be manipulated by the user and may thereafter be extracted from the SAS. The SAS may also enable the user to analyze data on the basis of medical history of the patient such as for the purpose of evaluating progress in medical conditions of the patient and the like. In another example the user may be able to obtain a statistical analysis of previous reports of the patient that may be stored in an E EHR. For example if a patient with blood group O positive needs to be administered drug Y the SAS may enable a user such as a doctor a nurse and the like to run a statistical analysis for finding the effect of the drug Y on patient records with the same blood group. Such an analysis may enable the user to find out whether the patient with blood group O positive is allergic to drug Y or not. In case an allergy is discovered the SAS may trigger an alarm to caution a physician regarding the allergy. The physician may then replace the drug Y with another medicine that may not cause allergy in the patient. In an embodiment the statistical analysis may be run on the basis of age of the patient medical history of the patient and the like.

In another exemplary scenario the MDS may be populated by providing data as per the standards of the Health Level Seven International HL7 feed. The HL7 provides standards for interoperability that improve care delivery optimize workflow reduce ambiguity and enhance knowledge transfer among all stakeholders including healthcare providers government agencies the vendor community fellow SDOs and patients.

In yet another exemplary case an Extensible Markup Language XML feed available as a web service may be captured by the MDS. The XML feed is syndication feed parser for both RSS and Atom feeds. It also implements feed auto discovery for finding feeds given a Uniform Resource Identifier URI . The XML feed supports the following syndication feed formats RSS 0.91 RSS 1.0 RSS 2.0 and Atom. The XML feed may provide a unified Application Programming Interface API for parsing and using the various syndication formats.

In yet another exemplary case the MDS may be populated in the manner of Software as a service SaaS . SaaS is a model of software deployment over the internet. With SaaS a provider licenses an application to customers for use as a service on demand either through a time subscription or a pay as you go model. In yet another exemplary case the MDS may be populated through Cloud computing. Cloud computing is Internet based computing whereby shared resources software and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand like a public utility.

In yet another exemplary case the MDS may be populated through a Service Oriented Architecture SOA . SOA is a flexible set of design principles used during the phases of systems development and integration. A deployed SOA based architecture will provide a loosely integrated suite of services that can be used within multiple business domains.

In yet another exemplary case the MDS may be populated by storing data in a database using the Structured Query Language SQL . The data may further be populated using .NET framework.

In yet another exemplary case the MDS may be populated using Java Server Pages JSP Active Server Pages ASP or asynchronous JavaScript and XML Ajax front end.

The healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may further be implemented in different environments. The different environments may include a Long Term Care LTC facility a Skilled Nursing Facility SNF and the like. A LTC provides residential daily living and medical services to a patient requiring extended medical attention. Such a facility may provide rehabilitative restorative and or ongoing skilled nursing care to patients or residents in need of assistance with activities of daily living. Long term care facilities include nursing homes rehabilitation facilities inpatient behavioral health facilities long term chronic care hospitals and the like. The SNF is a place of residence for people who require constant nursing care and have significant deficiencies with activities of daily living. The SNF may include rehabilitation and various medical and nursing procedures. In SNF every patient is under the direct supervision and care of a physician such that the physician may be available on an emergency basis. Further the records of the condition and care of every patient may be maintained nursing service may be available with at least one full time registered nurse on duty 24 hours a day. Also the SNF may have appropriate facilities for storing and dispensing drugs and biologics.

The healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may also be implemented through an environment such as the Assisted Living Facility ALF . An ALF may provide supervision or assistance to those living in a Residential Care Home Assisted Care Living Facility or a Personal Care Home they do not need constant nursing care but need help with activities of daily living. Coordination of services by outside health care providers and monitoring of patient activities to ensure their health safety and well being may also be provided. Assistance may further include the administration or supervision of medication or personal care services provided by a trained staff person.

Further the healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may also provide assistance to patients who choose an independent living environment. In times of illness or disability due to advanced age when managing activities of daily living becomes difficult help may be provided in the form of limited time care by a healthcare provider who visits at specific times to perform specific jobs such as administering medication bathing grooming cooking feeding and the like.

The healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may further be applied to different environments of medication delivery. The healthcare platform may provide different tools to reduce the delivery costs of the medication. In an exemplary case the delivery costs may be reduced by hedging the fuel or gas prices. Hedging will reduce or eliminate financial risk involved with variation in prices of gas. The healthcare platform will take two positions in the equity or commodity market that will offset each other if prices of gas change.

The healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may also reduce the delivery costs by cutting down some routes. This may be achieved by identifying the routes at which less medication are delivered and are also longer. Such routes may be cut down or the frequency of delivering the medication may be reduced on these routes to save the resources.

Further the healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may apply some algorithms to identify the proximity of the delivery destinations. By identifying the proximal destinations the healthcare platform may be able to control the frequency of delivery of medication to these destinations or may group the medication for the destinations that are close to each other.

The healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may also apply Artificial Intelligence AI based routing tools to identify the most efficient routes. In an example the healthcare platform may use Dijkstra s algorithm to find the shortest route.

The healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may also reduce the cost of delivery in real time routing. Deliveries may be regular deliveries or may be sweep run that cover a range of delivery locations in a geographic region or locale.

The healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration platform may assist in grouping the delivery orders. The grouping may be done on the basis of the facilities provided to the patients. Patients availing the same physical facility may be grouped together and medication for the entire group may be delivered together. Orders may also be grouped on the basis of the wing occupied by the patients. Orders for patients in the same wing may be grouped together. Order may also be grouped on the basis of the time of administration of a group of patients. In an example if the administration time for a group of patients is overlapping then the order for all those patients may be grouped together. Various other groupings are described herein and include grouping by floor wing section demographic type of medication taken facility group of facilities geographic region by attending physician by nursing staff and the like. For medications that have to be administered at various times throughout the day all of a patient s daily medication may be grouped by administration time and delivered for a specific patient to a location from which a healthcare provider can pull the medication at the required time. For a group of patients receiving medications throughout the day the medication may be grouped by time of administration for the group of patients and delivered to the caregiver location for that group of patients e.g. a wing of a patient floor in a long term care facility .

The healthcare platform may further facilitate populating of E EHR with the clinical outcome data. Outcome data may include patient response to medication resolution or worsening of symptoms onset of new symptoms and the like. The outcome data may include pain fatigue physical functioning emotional distress and social role participation that may have a major impact on quality of life across a variety of chronic diseases.

The clinical outcome data may be obtained from various sources. In an exemplary case the clinical outcome data may be obtained by providing a questionnaire over the web portal. Patients may access the web portal and fill the questionnaire. The questionnaire may be accessed through user name and password which may be provided by the healthcare platform to the patient. Further the questionnaire may include interview based subjective questions. The patient may also be asked to write his answers in free form as to what he feels. The questions in the questionnaire may also be provided in the form of multiple choices. Further the healthcare platform may provide incentives to the patients to fill the questionnaire and provide the clinical outcomes. The incentives may include providing discounts on filling the medical prescriptions. Further the discounts may be provided over self health testing equipments. The self health testing equipments may include equipments for measuring blood glucose level. The self health testing equipment may also include blood pressure measuring equipment. The healthcare platform may further provide incentives for interaction over patient portals that are healthcare related online web applications allowing patients to interact with their doctors physicians.

The clinical outcome data may also be collected from diagnosis based news groups. These news groups may be online web applications where the patients or participants may seek advice about the treatment or medication from other patients or participants who may have already experienced a similar kind problem. The clinical outcome data from such news groups may be collected by the healthcare platform by automatic scanning of keywords. In an example the keywords may include terms of a particular medication a particular diagnosis or treatment or any type of clinical outcome. Further these keywords may be weighted differently by the healthcare platform.

The clinical outcome data may further be collected by conducting regular visits of patient or participant at the doctor s office. In other cases the clinical outcome data may be collected from the patient s house. The medical administration data associated with the patient may be collected from the patient s house. Further the nurses may visit the patient s residence to collect vitals associated with the patient and later obtain the clinical outcomes with the help of these vitals. The vitals associated with the patient may include body temperature pulse rate or heart rate blood pressure and respiratory rate. The clinical outcome data may further be obtained by visiting offices of medical specialists. The medical specialists may include Ophthalmologist Endocrinologist Gastroenterologist Gynecologist Hematologist Laryngologist Cardiologist Neurologist Orthopedic surgeon Oncologist Pathologist Pediatrician Dermatologist Radiologist Rheumatologist and other medical specialists.

The clinical outcome data may further be collected by visiting emergency rooms of hospitals. The condition or the state of the patient in the emergency room may be analyzed to obtain the clinical outcome data.

Further the clinical outcome data may be obtained by diagnosing the patients in the hospital. The diagnosis may be conducted by providing a questionnaire to the patients and asking them to answer questions related to their health.

Further the clinical outcome data may be obtained from hospitals and clinics where the outpatients regularly visit. Such outpatients may be provided a questionnaire related to the treatment they are undergoing at the hospitals and clinics.

Further the clinical outcome data may be obtained from patients that are in long term care. The vitals of these patients may be regularly obtained to analyze the outcome of the drugs. The activity levels of these patients may also be monitored regularly to obtain clinical outcomes. The outcomes may also be obtained by analyzing the mood of the patient the movement of the patients the type of activity they perform and the performance of their tasks.

Another valuable source of clinical outcome data is that collected bedside at contemporaneous with the administration of medication. Upon administration of medications at the bedside the caregiver may be prompted to collect other relevant data. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the data related to outcomes may be collected by the person administering the medication at the time of administration and thus may be entered into the HPDMA along with the medication administration data. Therefore the HPDMA may include means for prompting the care giver to enter this information at the time of administration.

Because HPDMA provides for the real time tracking of medication administration data plus the contemporaneous collection of outcomes related to the medication the outcome engine has the ability to determine the efficacy of a drug in effect potentially providing the ability to conduct ad hoc studies. For example 6000 patients with condition A may exist. All 6000 of them are on drug X. 3000 of them are on drug X for condition A and drug Y for another condition. The 3000 on both drugs may fare better with respect to condition A. The methods and systems described herein allow one to extract such information and see connections that might have not otherwise been seen. In another example some patients taking drug D may stop taking a medication before the full prescribed amount is consumed because symptoms rapidly improve whereas others do not find improvement until the full course is administered. Using the method and systems of the HPDMA as described herein to analyze the full enhanced electronic health records of these two classes of patients statistically relevant factors among the classes of patients that may support the symptom improvement findings may be detected.

In embodiments of the invention the event outcome analytics facility may track the event outcomes that may be triggered from the various facilities depicted in . These tracked event outcomes may be collected in real time to be utilized by different computer applications to provide various types of outputs. In embodiments of the invention the different types of outputs may include without any limitations 1 predictions of treatment or clinical outcomes 2 predictions about costs of patient recovery or recuperation 3 grading or ratings for healthcare facilities healthcare professionals medication effectiveness and patient acceptance 4 reimbursements provided by the insurance companies for different types of medications and 5 customized clinical trials databases.

The outcome analytics facility may collect data in real time from various sources and facilities. In an embodiment of the system the outcome analytics facility may collect the events outcome from a middleware facility. The middleware facility may be a part of the three tier architecture which may be provided by the healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration . In the three tier architecture the presentation the application processing and the data management may be logically separated to each other. The middleware facility may allow the various facilities depicted in to service data requests between a user and a database. In embodiments of the invention the database may be associated with the E EHR E EMR facility or may be a third party database. Further the database may be accessed by the dashboard facility to present different types of reports to the user. The access of the database may also be required by the outcome analytics facility to provide predictions related to the outcomes.

Further in embodiments of the invention the healthcare and pharmacy data management and administration may allow the ordering of the collected data and the structuring of the collected data into various medical databases. In an embodiment of the invention the structuring of the collected data may be based on the different types of events. The different types of events may be related to the prescribing facilities the care planning facilities the laboratories imaging centers the insurance payments the rehabilitation and long term care facilities the electronic medical record repositories the dashboards and databases the third party sites the healthcare facilities and the like. In another embodiment of the invention the structuring of the collected data may be based on the diagnosis details of the one or more patients. In an example the event outcome data collected for a group of patients diagnosed with the same disease may be structured together in a database. In yet another embodiment of the invention the structuring of the collected data may be based on the treatment provided to the one or more patients. In yet another embodiment of the invention the structuring of the collected data may be based on the nature of the outcomes. In yet another embodiment of the invention the structuring of the collected data may be based on the demographics of the patients. In examples the demographics of the patients may include their date of birth gender birth year country postal code ethnicity blood type family doctor insurance provider and the like.

Further in embodiments of the invention the outcome analytics facility may perform a real time tracking of the outcomes associated with the prescribing events and the pharmacy fill events.

In embodiments once the event outcome data associated with the various facilities is collected the collected data may be utilized by different computer application facilities to provide various types of outputs. Alternatively the computer application facilities may utilize the data from the E EHR E EMR facility to provide various types of outputs. In an embodiment of the invention the computer application facilities may utilize the collected event outcome data to provide predicted outcome data.

In another embodiment of the invention the computer application facilities may utilize the collected event outcome data to predict costs of a patient recovery or recuperation. The costs of the patient recovery or recuperation may directly relate to various parameters like but not limited to the cost of administering a particular medication to the patient the reimbursements provided by the insurance companies for that medication the cost of long term care provided by the health care facility the cost of rehabilitation centers provided by the health care facility the cost involved in various types of laboratory tests the cost of admission in the healthcare facility and the like. Further the collected event outcome data from different facilities depicted in and other sources may relate to all these discussed parameters. The computer application facilities may thus apply known in the art prediction and financial algorithms on the collected event outcome data to predict the cost of patient recovery.

In other embodiments of the invention the computer application facilities may utilize the collected event outcome data to grade or provide ratings to facilities provided by the healthcare facility healthcare professionals medication effectiveness and patient acceptance.

The effectiveness of a medication may be measured in terms of its clinical outcomes. For example equal number of dosages of different medications administered to a patient for a disease may yield different clinical outcomes. Thus the medication that may yield better and desirable clinical outcomes with less number of dosages may be considered effective. A medication may also be considered effective if the medication is able to cure more than one disease. The effectiveness of a medication may also be measured in monetary terms by analyzing the economical perspective of the medication. For example there may be more than one effective medication that may be used to treat a set of diagnosed symptoms one of these may be more expensive than the other but equally effective with regard to alleviating symptoms of the patient. In this scenario the financial value may determine the selection of the medicine and the medication with less cost may be considered more effective. Further the collected event outcome data may correspond to effectiveness of different types of medications. The computer application facilities may apply known in the art correlation algorithms to rate or grade the effectiveness of the medications.

The collected event outcome data may also provide information about the patient s acceptances to various types of medications treatments and facilities. The acceptances to different types of medications and treatments may be measured by the clinical or treatment outcomes. The acceptances to different facilities e.g. LTC and rehabilitation of a healthcare facility may be measured by the checking the number of patients opting for those facilities. Further the computer application facilities may apply known in the art algorithms to rate or grade the acceptances patients to various types of medications treatments and facilities. In an embodiment of the invention the information about the ratings of the facilities provided by the healthcare facility the ratings of the healthcare professionals the ratings of medication effectiveness and the ratings of patient acceptances may be sold to a publication company for publishing the information in the articles of journals related to medical science.

In other embodiments of the invention the computer application facilities may utilize the collected event outcome data to provide customized clinical trials database.

In an embodiment of the invention the database storing the collected event outcome data may be linked to a website of the healthcare facility to provide non confidential information including but not limited to ratings of healthcare professionals associated with the healthcare facility medication effectiveness administered by the healthcare facility patient acceptance to administered medications and facilities provided by the healthcare facility. The website of the healthcare facility may provide information about the amount of reimbursements provided by insurance companies to the administered medications facilities used and the like. In an example a user or a potential patient of the healthcare facility may visit the website provide by the healthcare facility to check the reimbursements provided by insurance companies for certain medications that are administered by the health care facility. As the website is linked to the database of collected event outcome data the website upon applying some known in the art algorithms may provide the reimbursement details to the user. Further the website may provide an updated information to the user as the data is event outcome data is tracked collected and updated in real time.

The HPDMA may include connecting in real time a diversity of data collection storage entry display management and maintenance systems. Each of these systems may have unique data rules formats needs and the like that may make sharing healthcare related data among them challenging. One option for dealing with these challenges is to implement software or software based computing systems that can operate between the diverse facilities and databases forming a middleware that facilitates consistently sharing data. Middleware may support data format transformation form filling data field compliance checking business rules normalization and the like that may allow data from diverse systems to be shared and combined with high quality results. Middleware may be embodied as software that executes on computers such as servers clients hosts network appliances medical devices and the like to allow data that may be natively captured entered or stored by a computer associated with a particular facility e.g. medication administration to be shared with other facilities e.g. as shown in without requiring the two facilities to have identical data formats business rules and the like. Middleware may be a combination of software and hardware that may be integrated with any facility depicted in or that may be a self standing system that is connected to the backbone or various combinations thereof

A couple of exemplary cases may be helpful in understanding how middleware may facilitate data sharing among the facilities depicted in . In a first example data from a laboratory facility e.g. mammography imaging lab may include device specific or industry standard image data patient data automated analysis data technician observations radiologist interpretation data and the like. This data may be combined with mediation administration data that may be captured partially from a device reader from a caregiver administering the medication and from a prescription management facility based on the device reader captured data to be stored in an enhanced electronic health record. Ensuring that data from these many sources can be effectively combined into one enhanced electronic health record that can be used by other facilities e.g. dashboards outcome analytics various planning facilities and the like may be accomplished with middleware. In a second example raw barcode data that may be captured by a hand held scanner during a medication administration event may be transferred in real time to a pharmacy management dashboard for display to a pharmacist. The raw barcode may be transformed by middleware so that it can be properly displayed in the dashboard. Because the raw barcode data may require further context to be properly displayed in the dashboard middleware may use the raw barcode data to lookup patient information in an enhanced electronic health record database combine the patient information with transformed medication data e.g. from the raw barcode data and facilitate presenting the combined data to the pharmacy dashboard.

The middleware methods and systems of the HPDMA may be used to transform data received from the diversity of facilities to a common format based on pre defined criteria for use in a common datastore e.g. an enhanced electronic health record . Middleware may alternatively transform manually entered data into machine readable format. Middleware may also support structural association of data filtering of data and the like.

The middleware facility may include processes that may facilitate storage of data in the common datastore. In this aspect the data may be normalized before being stored in the datastore. The normalization may facilitate reducing redundancy of data ensuring data consistency optimizing data retrieval from a common data store and the like. In an example the patient data may be normalized by allocating a unique patient identification number for all of a patient s data stored in the common data store. The normalization may require that the unique patient identifiers associated with each of the diversity of medical facilities be transformed by the middleware to the unique patient identifier

Middleware may ensure that data is cleaned before storing it into a common database. Cleaning of data may be accomplished by filtering the data breaking up complex data into uniform data fields and the like. In an example a delimiter character may be present in data being received from a patient attribute facility and the delimiter may be removed by the middleware before the data is recorded in the database. Alternatively data received from a prescribing facility may include brand name data for a prescription. Middleware may support filing in a generic medication field of an enhanced electronic health record based on the brand name found in the prescription.

Middleware may be embodied in technologies such as SOAP web services service oriented architecture or other similar technologies.

Middleware may facilitate distributing a common datastore such as an enhanced electronic health record across various medical related facilities e.g. those depicted in by handling the data format transformation correlation lookups and the like needed to ensure that any view of the distributed data exhibits consistency across the data sources. Likewise middleware may facilitate communication among the facilities through secure means such as virtual private networks and other network tunneling techniques that work cooperatively with firewalls and the like.

Healthcare planning also called Care Planning is a key to improving the health of the population of a region a country and the like. In most countries healthcare planning and management takes place at national regional or local level reflecting various tiers of government for healthcare systems. Healthcare planning may include offering various health facilities to citizens of a country. Healthcare planning may be provided and or maintained by many entities such as governmental non profit and private entities. For example healthcare organizations such as hospitals can provide comprehensive medical facility planning services to people. Healthcare planning may include various plans in accordance with the requirement of people. For example a family health plan will be aimed at the full family while a group employee benefit plan will be an employee welfare oriented plan established or maintained by an employer or by an employee s organization. In addition a health plan may be a subscription based medical care arrangement offered by commercial insurance companies.

Efficient healthcare planning may require defining appropriate goals and objectives that may further facilitate the creation of appropriate strategies for implementing the same.

The data requirements to achieve the objectives and goals for a care plan may be driven by a number of factors and or macro forces such as demography role of government environmental shift social set up healthcare innovation and competition regulations and the like. This may be apparent by way of a few examples that are described below.

Healthcare planning may be aimed at improving the physical and functional status of the public health based on the health status and disease profiles for a given demography or region. Therefore access to timely accurate comprehensive and diverse medically related event data may be important for healthcare planning. For example reduction of communicable disease profiles in a Sub Saharan region may be an objective for a healthcare entity that may be more readily achieved with real time data for patients and others in the region. Similarly the objective of healthcare planning may be to meet the high levels of healthcare reforms promised by the government. In such a scenario measuring health care quality actions results outcomes and the like is essential to ensure that reform goals are met. The methods and systems described herein may provide data for such healthcare planning activities.

It is also known that diseases are linked to climate changes. In light of this the healthcare planning goal may be to decrease medical plan utilization for environmentally borne diseases such as malaria. By collecting bed side data and associating it with medical plan data movement toward such a goal may be measurable. With respect to healthcare innovations and regulations the objectives of care planning may be to make the most effective branded drugs readily available and affordable for those who demonstrate a need for such drugs. By collecting and analyzing medication prescription administration and outcome data the methods and systems herein may facilitate determining an efficacy of medications. In sum the data needs of care planning may encompass data related to prevention and control of health problems judicious planning optimization and utilization of healthcare resources and the like.

Care planning may require health data from various sources that may be useful in planning patient treatment. This data may relate to physiological emotional and environmental wellbeing of an individual. For this purpose medical history of a patient may be utilized. Examples of physiological health data may include weight age blood pressure glucose levels blood cells count hemoglobin levels hypertension cholesterol stroke pre clampsia diabetes allergy seizures asthma and the like. Similarly emotional well being data may include information on stress levels lifestyle patterns relationship issues EQ quotients any special needs and the like. Further examples of environmental well being may include information on exposure to pollution neighborhood conditions food supply and the like. These types of data may be readily available to care planning activities by accessing an enhanced electronic health record as described herein.

The healthcare plans may be offered to individuals or customers based on their needs that may be ascertained from profile information or medical history. This also forms the basis of developing goal oriented healthcare plans. For example an over weight patient may be offered a weight reduction health plan for achieving a desired weight. Similarly a person with high systolic blood pressure may be offered a health program that may include exercise regime for controlling the blood pressure and the like. Not only can an enhanced electronic health record capture patient conditions and changes it can also include plan data e.g. weight goals and the like that makes the further assessment of a patient s progress and predicting the outcome for treatments toward the goal possible.

Care planning may be designed for specific needs of various individuals. The healthcare needs for women children elderly professionals defense personnel and the like may differ significantly from each other. For example for women a health plan focused on maintaining adequate bone density or maintaining hormonal balance may be required and specifically for pregnant women the health plan may be focused on overall nourishment. Likewise healthcare needs of children aged 2 8 may be different from those of teenagers. For professionals with hectic working hours a plan that leverages the exercise and diet routine may be preferred. Similarly for the elderly or defense personnel a specific weight or glucose level goal may be the focus of a health plan. Ensuring that healthcare planning can encompass these very diverse goals and needs may require access to a diversity of data from a diversity of medical facilities such as those described in of the present invention. The HPDMA as described herein may provide the means and capabilities to support achieving diverse care planning goals.

Care planning may be designed based on patient touch points such as office visits emergency room visits ERs inpatient and outpatient quarters rehabilitation centers and the like. For example data for a care plan for an emergency room may be intensive and focused and may require real time data collection access and dashboarding. Multidisciplinary teams of experts may be deployed in the ER areas to meet the variety of patient needs. In addition with real time access to administration and outcome data for a plurality of patients detailed individualized care plans may be developed for an emergency department.

Similarly a care plan for a rehabilitation center may focus on a number of parameters such as background needs of the patient medical equipment needs home healthcare environment needs nutrition supply commodities education training and the like all of which may be determined from outcome and treatment data of a wide diversity of rehabilitation center patients across the country. Such data may be accessible in a nationally maintained enhanced electronic health record system as described in .

Also the needs of inpatients and outpatients may be different emphasizing the need for different care plans for both of them. Inpatients may require nutritional and daily care temporary support such as bathing or dressing while outpatients may prefer a short queuing time for medications and check up.

Maternity wards may also require a well designed care planning. For example requirement for a hygienic and separate ward for newborns and those with special needs.

Insurance processing is a method of collectively pooling the risks of insurance payouts across a diverse population. Specifically for healthcare risk for incurring medical and health expenses may be pooled among the various entities patients insurance companies health professionals etc. Healthcare insurance processing may include various data related steps such as data collection data validation insurance claims processing insurance clearance payments expense justification recovery analysis and the like. The methods and systems described herein may provide such data in real time and over a long period of time from a diversity of patients.

Data collection may be a highly significant step in the insurance process. This may include collection of information pertaining to a variety of data such as medical history of a patient current diagnosis treatment prescribed therapist surgeon medical specialist information follow up treatment frequency and duration of treatment amount mode process of payment and the like.

The medical history of a patient may include information from physical examination of a patient for various elements such as general survey skin head eyes ears nose sinus mouth throat neck chest tumor growth lungs heart abdomen extremities lymphatic blood vessels neurological and the like. The medical history may also include information on previous diagnoses consultations and examination by physicians or medical practitioners. The medical history may also reveal if the patient has utilized any diagnostic therapeutic surgical or non surgical and rehabilitation services in the past. An enhanced electronic health record may combine current and past medical treatment and outcome data for an individual across geographic locations insurance plans life changes and the like.

Current diagnosis information may include various possibilities regarding the state of the current disease and symptoms. For example if a patient is admitted to a hospital with complaints of severe pain in the pelvic region a likely diagnosis in this case may be possible endometriosis. Based on this indicative information the insurance processing may be conducted. By providing access to data representing symptoms treatment and outcomes of such a diagnosis across a large number of patients the HPDMA may be found to be useful in determining the monetary range for insurance claims that may be required for relevant treatment options.

Information on medical practitioner specialist surgeon and physician may also be significant for insurance processing. Because the charges and or expenses related to a medical treatment may depend on the medical practitioner knowing something about the efficacy of a practitioner in treating a specific condition may influence how much an insurance company may be willing to pay for the practitioner s services. By allowing access to certain information across a wide range of patients the HDPMA may facilitate such efficacy determination.

Similarly information regarding mode of payment such as cash or credit onetime or periodic may be useful for insurance processing. In case the payment mode is credit based the issuing bank information name location policies may be of importance for insurance parties. While it may be preferable to limit access to financial information that is associated with a patient the enhanced electronic health record as described herein may facilitate making this information securely accessible and readily linkable to other information in the record that may be pertinent to insurance processing.

Further insurance processing may also include information regarding the payment co payment and reimbursement options. By ensuring that medication administration data is automatically and accurately collected it may be possible to collect data to support reimbursement of out of pocket costs for unused medications.

A well planned and well designed facility may provide long term benefit to a healthcare organization. This may also be significant with respect to the organization s objectives such as financial productivity meeting demand for services and changes in technology for healthcare optimal utilization of already existing healthcare resources and the like. Healthcare providers and planners may utilize healthcare data for devising solutions for facility planning and space programming for healthcare services.

Healthcare data for facility planning may be related to the mix ratio of inpatient and outpatient services older and critically sick patient population treatment patterns advancement in technology health data related to diseases and conditions asthma cholesterol diabetes heart disease hypertension obesity etc. type of healthcare ambulatory services ER visits etc. data related to injuries accidents suicides homicides etc. life stages and population births deaths women s health children s health state and territorial distribution etc. lifestyle drug use smoking exercise etc. and the like. Each of these data fields and their role in healthcare facility planning will be discussed in detail in the following description.

In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention healthcare data may be an aggregated or composite healthcare data. The healthcare data may be obtained from public sources such as statistics published by government agencies research groups and web engines or from secondary sources such as medical history or profile information of patients visiting a healthcare facility.

The mix ratio of inpatient and outpatient services may be a factor for facility planning. For example a higher number of outpatient services may be an indicator of an additional outpatient ward. Similarly an increasingly high number of older patient populations may call for design of facilities that reduce waiting time during admission and discharge provision of wheelchairs canes elevators provision of chemist shops within the facility long term care units and the like.

The advancement in technology for example digital imaging technology may affect facility design and planning for a healthcare unit such as a diagnostic and interventional radiology facility or laboratory. Conventionally film based imaging departments constituted dark rooms large file rooms large central technical work area and a minimal preparation and recovery area. Current advancements in technology require highly specialized and advanced telecommunications infrastructure capable of rapid transmission of large data files to workstations throughout the hospital physicians offices in the community and even consulting radiologists halfway around the world. Facility design may require consideration of all such factors.

Data public or secondary regarding the diseases and conditions may also be pertinent for facility planning and management. Increased number of cases reported for asthma and obesity may lead to designing of facilities that are dust free and equipped with exercise apparatus respectively.

A high number of emergency room visits may indicate a need for designing the ERs and trauma centers such that the amount of time taken to carry the injured to these facilities may be minimized. These facilities may be designed near a small helipad within the healthcare unit if possible for catering to emergency situations such as disaster fire accident earthquake etc. 

Similarly information pertaining to injuries may be useful in integrating the main healthcare facilities with some additional facilities. For example if the statistics indicate high number of suicide cases in a given region centers for preventive treatment yoga alternate medicine meditation community centers etc. may be provided with a hospital.

Various life stages and population statistics birth and mortality rates gender statistics etc. may be useful for facility design. For example an increase in the number of children s health records in a community may indicate a need for planning a child friendly healthcare center in that community. Likewise a disproportionate male female child ratio in a developing country may indicate need for a community center that may act as an awareness camp for the masses.

A long term care center or a facility may provide rehabilitative restorative and or ongoing skilled nursing care to patients or residents in need of assistance with activities of daily living. This facility planning may require specific consideration and design than the facility planning for a general healthcare center since it may cater to the needs of a specific group e.g. elderly or homeless that are otherwise not able to get focused healthcare and attention. Examples of long term care facilities may include nursing homes rehabilitation facilities inpatient behavioral health facilities long term chronic care hospitals and the like. Long term care facilities may be designed to make them safe functional durable and relatively easy to maintain. Some parameters to be considered while designing the long term care facilities may include design layout ambience color management dining and food management online and kiosk based layouts and the like. For example the facilities may be designed to include automatic ID scanners for residents using the dining facility.

Facility operations may be planned by collecting aggregated content from Enhanced Electronic Health Records E EHR as described herein of the patients in a healthcare center or hospital. The E EHR data may correspond to information regarding inpatients outpatient staff administrators and the like. Based on these records facility layout may be planned. For example a yoga center or gymnasium may be provided in close vicinity of the hospital for the benefit of the healthcare professionals working in shifts or emergency areas and who are not able to attend the same due to unpredictable job demands.

Facility planning may also be related to medication supply management. A separate section or layout may be designed for provision of medicines and other health related equipments and aids such as belts bandages syringes etc.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention these medicine counters may also be self help desk counters or online kiosks. Provision of such medication centers may facilitate smooth work flow for patients administrators guardians etc. may be effective due to reduction in time between diagnosis and administration of medicines and may be cost effective. In addition it may also reduce the problems associated with non availability of certain medications outside the hospital premises. Determining how and when to effect a medication supply facility e.g. prescription management medication inventory management packaging dispensing and the like may require accurate and timely data collection about the prescriptions a prescriber patients medications prescribed outcomes and the like being served by the facility and by other facilities. The methods and systems described herein in association with the HPDMA may provide such capabilities.

Further these counters furnished with cost effective drugs may minimize illegal sale of drugs. For example Tamiflu for swine flu may be sold at the hospital counters at lower price thus encouraging people not to buy the same illegally from outside stores. In addition this may help the government and health agencies in maintaining proper supply and demand for emergency medications by discouraging stocking of these medications outside.

Facility planning may also involve scheduling of various tasks and resources in a healthcare unit. Scheduling may include scheduling patients for appointments diagnosis surgery tests consultation rooms for admission clean up administration operations healthcare professionals and specialists for meetings visits and the like. By providing access to prescription management data that may include administration information such as administration schedules requirements and the like a facility planning function operating in conjunction with the HPDMA may substantially improve the value and efficiency of such facility planning

Scheduling may be performed manually or automatically with the aid of software and tools. This activity may be pertinent since some of the tasks may be period specific. For example radiation treatments may be provided only on weekdays and not on weekends thereby necessitating the need for scheduling the appointment of the patients with the therapists from Monday to Friday.

In addition scheduling may be significant to accommodate any alterations or revisions in the pre decided schedule for example accommodating absence of one specialist by another on any given day.

Furthermore scheduling may be important for some activities that may be sequential in nature. For example scheduling a steam bath after a therapeutic massage session. This type of scheduling may facilitate optimization of given resources for an organization. In sum facility planning may require consideration of availability of given resources and to address requirements for handicaps like inability to climb staircase visual impairment special washroom facilities etc.

The HPDMA may also be associated with insurance planning facilities as depicted in . Insurance may be provided by government sponsored social insurance programs or from private insurance companies and it may be applicable to an individual or to a group. An objective of the insurance planning is to ensure adequate medical coverage is provided to protect the covered groups or individuals from unexpected healthcare expenses by payment of premiums or taxes.

Insurance planning may use information provided by the various facilities of the HPDMA and in particular E EHRs outcome databases and the like to make adjustments in available plans based on the suitability of such insurance plans based for an individual. Plan parameters that may be impacted by insurance planning may include customary fees exclusions maximum out of pocket expenses non cancellation cases premium and the like.

The accessibility of a large number of enhanced electronic health records in an E EHR database may facilitate establishing a generic profile of patients and their caretakers for insurance planning. For example insurance planning using the generic profile may result in a new insurance plan being offered to individuals with a high risk job profile.

Pharmaceutical or pharmacy planning is another area that may benefit from access to various data from the facilities and data sources of the HPDMA such as for devising pharmaceutical related decisions. These data source may include medical history data from the care planning or validation diagnosis aspect of the HPDMA laboratories and imaging facilities rehabilitation facilities databases of past medical records e.g. E EHR third party data sources and the like.

In certain cases market driven research may be required for making a pharmacy related decision. The data from market research may relate to marketplace environment treatment choices available providers and patients profile behavioral patterns and the like. At least a portion of such data may be derived from pertinent information accessible in an E EHR.

A data source such as outcome data e.g. outcome database may reveal that patients suffer from a side effect e.g. stomach infection after taking a particular medication. In light of this observation planning may be done regarding changing the prescription instructions. In extension to this pharmacy related planning may also include devising methods and processes to make this possible side effect and administration information public such as by means of improving product packaging broadcasting through print and electronic media and the like. Alternately pharmacy planning may include development of a medication that is easier to digest or development of a medication that may suppress the side effects of the previous drug.

Drug delivery mechanism may also be significant with regard to pharmacy planning By analyzing outcome data it may be determined that a particular oral drug formulation may not be preferred by consumers because of its bitter taste so planning may be done to prepare the drug in inhalable form.

Regulatory and compliance needs may be a cause of concern for healthcare professionals since these regulations may directly affect an organization s profitability and business success. Accurate comprehensive data collection may be essential to properly complying with regulatory requirements. By providing robust detailed timely and comprehensive data collection medication tracking administration record keeping and the like the HPDMA may provide individuals responsible for meeting regulatory requirements with beneficial tools that ease such compliance. Planning and decision making based on this information may be improved with respect to improving and meeting compliance addressing existing deficiencies in the processes reducing business risks and the like.

Collection of regulatory data may be necessary and significant for the continuous monitoring and reassessment of a drug s safety quality and efficacy effectiveness. The HPDMA may provide a platform for ensuring compliant data collection and management.
