This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 823 435 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 359 642 filed Jun. 25 2010 entitled Restricting Mature Content which is herein incorporated by reference.

Embodiments of our technology are defined by the claims below not this summary. A high level overview of various aspects of our technology are provided here for that reason to provide an overview of the disclosure and to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description section. This summary is not intended to identify key features nor essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter. In brief and at a high level this disclosure describes among other things ways to restrict a user s access to mature content.

In a first aspect a data card inserted into a user s device and configured to facilitate communications through a network includes a network interface element configured to handle communications to and from the user s device. The data card also includes an image assembler configured to communicate with the network interface and detect and assemble images contained in a plurality of data packets received in communications at the user s device. The data card further includes a storage device for storing the image assembled by the image assembler during and after the assembly process an image scanner configured to scan the assembled image for mature content and to determine that the image has mature content and a content restrictor configured to restrict access to the mature content. The content restrictor includes a blocker an encryptor and a reporter.

In a second aspect computer executable instructions embodied on computer readable media facilitate a method of controlling access to mature content designated as inappropriate for viewing by a designated class of people contained in a communication that is received at a data card inserted into a computing device. The method includes receiving at the data card a communication that includes a plurality of data packets. A determination is made that the communication includes an image. The image is assembled in storage located on the data card by extracting a plurality of portions of the image from the plurality of data packets. A determination is made as to whether the image has been previously flagged as containing mature content. When the image has been previously flagged as containing mature content then access to the mature content is restricted. When the image has not been previously flagged as containing mature content then a determination is made that the image includes mature content by scanning the image with a feature recognition component that is located on the data card. Based on the determination that the image includes mature content the image is flagged with an indication that the image has been scanned and with an indication that the image includes mature content. The flagged image is stored at a storage in the computing device and access to the mature content is restricted.

The subject matter of the present technology is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. However the description itself is not intended to define the technology which is what the claims do. Rather the claimed subject matter might be embodied in other ways to include different components steps or combinations of components or steps similar to the ones described in this document in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover although the term step or other generic term might be used herein to connote different components or methods employed the terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.

Throughout this disclosure several acronyms and shorthand notations are used to aid the understanding of certain concepts pertaining to the associated system and services. These acronyms and shorthand notations are solely intended for the purpose of providing an easy methodology of communicating the ideas expressed herein and are in no way meant to limit the scope of the present technology. The following is a list of these acronyms 

Embodiments of the technology may be embodied as among other things a method system or set of instructions embodied on one or more computer readable media. Computer readable media include both volatile and nonvolatile media removable and nonremovable media and contemplate media readable by a database a switch and various other network devices. By way of example computer readable media comprise media implemented in any method or technology for storing information. Examples of stored information include computer executable instructions data structures program modules and other data representations.

Aspects of embodiments of the invention described herein provide for restricting access to mature content. As it is used herein the phrase mature content refers to any type of content that is inappropriate for a user to experience e.g. view hear read etc. . It should be understood that the terms content and inappropriate can each have a wide variety of meanings many of which are considered to be within the ambit of the present invention. In some embodiments of the invention mature content may be defined more formally such as e.g. during implementation by a network administrator or the like to mean content that is inappropriate for viewing by a designated class of people. In embodiments classes of people can be designated automatically by a network administrator individually by a parent or anyone else including by applications programs APIs user inputs third party content vendors and the like.

According to embodiments for example mature content can be defined to include any content that would fit a legal definition e.g. from a statute regulation court decision etc. of pornography. In some embodiments mature content might be defined to include any content that has a particular rating such as for example PG 13 or higher. It should be understood that in various implementations of aspects of the invention mature content can be defined in any number of ways as can the term inappropriate. By implementing aspects of embodiments of the invention network administrators parents teachers managers and the like can manage access to mature content by network users children students employees and the like. While parental filters and other content filters are known in the art these filters typically depend on ascertaining information about a communication such as for example where the communication originated to whom it is directed its size whether it has current certificates and the like.

By utilizing embodiments of the invention mature content can be identified based on the content itself without having to ascertain any information e.g. metadata associated with the content or the message in which it is contained. This feature can be advantageous for a number of readily apparent reasons including for example to restrict the communication of pornographic or otherwise sexually inappropriate content to young people e.g. to minors who are legally prohibited from viewing and or possessing such content .

For instance a growing trend among young people has caught the attention of lawmakers and parents alike. The term is sometimes referred to as sexting and is often characterized by situations in which a young person sends an inappropriate e.g. pornographic picture or other inappropriate content to another young person through some communication service such as for example through an instant messaging service an SMS service an MMS service an email service or the like. Various aspects of embodiments of the invention facilitate restricting access to such mature content by individuals that belong to one or more restricted classes.

As the term is used herein restricted class refers to a group e.g. classification of individuals that has been designated as a group of individuals for whom access to mature content or a particular type of mature content would be inappropriate. In embodiments restricted classes can be designated in any suitable manner and can be defined by any number of different criteria. For example in an embodiment one restricted class might be minors e.g. individuals that are younger than a legal age for viewing pornography . In another embodiment such as for example where aspects of the invention described herein are implemented on a family mobile device a restricted class can be a child or children . It should be apparent that according to various embodiments of the invention a restricted class might include a single particular individual while in other embodiments a restricted class might include millions of people e.g. anyone meeting a set of designated criteria .

To restrict access to mature content embodiments of the invention provide a content filter. As the term is used herein content filter refers to a component of a computing device i.e. software hardware firmware or a combination thereof that facilitates restricting access to mature content by individuals that belong to one or more restricted classes. As mentioned above the content filters described herein as embodiments of the invention facilitate identification of mature content by analyzing the content itself and restricting access to the identified mature content by individuals belonging to a restricted class referred to herein interchangeably as members of a restricted class and restricted users .

According to embodiments of the invention the content filter receives a communication such as for example an email an MMS message an SMS message an instant message or the like and determines whether the communication includes any images. In embodiments communications can have images embedded therein or attached thereto. Upon determining that the communication includes an image the content filter extracts the image and scans the image to determine whether the images contain mature content. If the image is determined to include mature content the content filter can according to various embodiments perform any number of different actions to restrict access to the mature content by members of a restricted class.

According to various embodiments of the invention a content filter can be placed in any number of physical or logical locations. For example in an embodiment a content filter is placed on a mobile device such that for example if a minor is using the mobile device any mature content that another individual communicates to the mobile device is not viewable by the minor user. Other embodiments of the invention a content filter implemented on a network element in a mobile network. For example in an embodiment a content filter may be included on a network server through which mobile communication traffic flows. In this manner the content filter can intercept communications determine whether the communications include images extract images from communications scan the images for mature content and restrict access to the mature content by restricted users.

According to various embodiments of the invention upon determining that an image in a communication contains mature content the content filter located on the network element can perform any number of different actions to prevent a restricted user from viewing the content. For example in an embodiment if the recipient is a minor user the network can simply remove the image from the communication before forwarding the communication onto the minor user s mobile device. In other embodiments the content filter can determine the intended recipient or the intended recipient s device and interact with a billing entity such as for example an AAA server to determine information about the intended recipient. For example a billing record can identify whether the intended recipient is a minor. In some embodiments the content filter located on the network may upon identifying mature content in a communication encrypt the mature content and or the image in which the mature content is identified. In an embodiment the network server can forward the communication through the network to the recipient using some functionality for allowing an adult user to authenticate the adult user s identity and or age to the network to obtain permission to access mature content.

In another embodiment a content filter is implemented on a data card. It should be understood by those having skill in the art that a data card can be inserted into a computing device to facilitate communications such as for example broadband communications between the computing device and other devices networks and the like. According to embodiments a data card can include components for detecting an image in a communication assembling the image from a number of data packets scanning the image to determine whether it includes mature content and if so removing the image from the communication. In embodiments the content filter on the data card can also notify a connection manager application of the mature content. The connection manager in turn can provide alternate content encrypt mature content impose authentication restrictions and the like.

As is further illustrated in image scanner can interact with database . In various embodiments of the invention database includes feature template . Image scanner can in various embodiments include functionalities similar to those known in the arts that are used for face recognition. That is for example image scanner can analyze individual pixels of image to detect portions of image that image scanner can recognize as for example mature content. According to embodiments of the invention for example image scanner references one or more feature templates maintained in database .

In embodiments feature template can include for example a data structure portion of computer code XML files or the like that include the representation of a feature. In various embodiments the features represented in feature templates are features that have been designated as being mature content including mature content or being associated with the probability of being a portion of mature content. In operation image scanner can reference feature template and compare the representations of features in feature template to features identified in image . So for example if image scanner determines that a portion of image is consistent with a representation of a feature in feature template image scanner can use that information for example as a basis for determining that image includes mature content. In some embodiments of the invention image scanner determines whether or not image includes any mature content. In various embodiments image scanner can determine portions of image that include mature content.

According to some embodiments of the invention image scanner can also be configured to identify types of mature content found in image . For example in some implementations it may be desirable to define mature content according to several different types thereof for classification. For instance in some embodiments image scanner might determine that a portion of image includes mature content that correspond to a particular level on a rating system similar to for example a movie rating system. In this manner by implementing embodiments of the invention mature contents can be restricted not only on the basis of for example a recipient s age but also can be access to mature content can be restricted based on varying classifications of mature content and or restricted classes of users.

Messaging application can cause communication to be displayed to user where the user may be allowed access only through a portion of content contained therein and the like.

As further indicated above content restrictor also includes reporter . In embodiments reporter can interact with a billing server . Reporter can generate a report that includes an indication that mature content was identified in an image or communication or a portion of image . In embodiments mobile device provides the report to a network element such as for example billing server which can store the report in associated storage . In this manner access to mature content can be monitored and tracked for billing informational management and other purposes. It should be understood that billing server can utilize report or provide reports to other network elements for any number of different types of processing.

Although the discussion above generally refers to communication as one that is received from another device remote from mobile device in some embodiments of the invention communication can be a communication from a user or other local entity. That is for example mobile device can be configured to restrict access to mature content that is inputted to mobile device in a manner other than by a communication from a remote device. In some embodiments communication can include any number of different types of data information inputs and the like. For example in some embodiments mobile device includes a camera device which can be any type of image capturing device video capturing device or the like.

By implementing embodiments of the invention an image that is captured by camera device can be provided to content filter and for scanning for mature content. For example as shown in by reference numeral a camera application receives image from camera device . In embodiments camera application can interact with content filter such as for example by providing image to image scanner as shown by reference numeral in . Image scanner can determine whether image includes mature content.

In embodiments access to image captured by camera device can be restricted in any number of ways such as for example by not allowing image to be saved to storage on mobile device . In some embodiments image may be stored on mobile device but subsequent access to it can be restricted. Thus for example in an embodiment when a user attempts to attach image to an email having a restricted user listed in the to field restrictor can block the attachment. In other embodiments restrictor can be adapted to encrypt image upon attachment to a communication. In further embodiments alternate content can be used to replace image either on mobile device or in an outgoing message.

In some instances users may desire to have the ability to determine whether there are any images on mobile device that include mature content. In an embodiment image extractor includes a flagging module . In other embodiments flagging module can be included in any other component of mobile device or as an independent component. In embodiments flagging module is configured to flag images and . As the term is used herein flagging an image means associating information with the image. In embodiments flagging module associates an indication of one or more states with an image or i.e. flagging module flags an image with an indication of one or more states . In embodiments flags can be employed in various forms such as for example entries in a table e.g. where the table stores a list of images on mobile device and a list of corresponding flags etc. metadata embedded data or the like.

For example in an embodiment image scanner can be used e.g. in response to a user input a network input an automatic event a predetermined time frame etc. to scan all of the images residing in storage on mobile device . Flagging module flags each scanned image with an indication that the image has been scanned and with an indication of whether the image includes mature content. In some embodiments images can be flagged with for example an indication of a type of mature content included in the image an indication of a location of mature content in the image i.e. an indication of which portion of the image includes mature content and the like.

In embodiments flags can also include other relevant data such as for example a time stamp corresponding to the time at which the image was scanned an indication of what prompted the scan an indication of a user that initiated the scan and the like. In this manner image extractor image scanner or some other component can determine upon referencing or accessing an image whether the image has been scanned for mature content and if so whether the image includes mature content and in embodiments what type of mature content the image includes . In some embodiments access to different types of mature content may be restricted for different individuals e.g. restricted classes and in some implementations flagging module can flag images with an indication of which restricted classes are associated with the image i.e. which classes of people should be restricted from accessing the image . In other embodiments flagging module might only flag images with an indication of whether the images include mature content and or what type of mature content the images include. In this manner the presence of a flag either indicating that the image includes mature content or that the image does not include mature content can be interpreted by flagging module as evidence that the image has been scanned.

Accordingly in some embodiments of the invention when a communication that contains an image is received flagging module checks for flags thereby determining whether the image previously has been scanned. If the image has not been scanned it may be provided to image scanner as described above. Flagging module can flag image to indicate that it has been scanned. On the other hand if image is determined to have been scanned already flagging module determines by examining corresponding flags whether image has been determined to include mature content. If so image can be provided directly to restrictor for restriction processing. If not image can bypass restrictor for example and be accessible to a user.

To illustrate the flagging procedure described above turn briefly to . is a flowchart depicting an illustrative method of utilizing flags to facilitate content restriction management of images in a mobile device. At a first illustrative step step an image scanner scans all images found on the mobile device. In embodiments the image scanner can scan the images to determine whether the images include mature content what type of mature content the images include and the like. At step a flagging module flags each scanned image with a flag indicating whether the image includes mature content. In some embodiments additional flags can be utilized to convey other types of information about the image as well.

At step a communication is received. In embodiments the communication can be a communication originating at a device remote from the mobile device e.g. an email from a friend a text message from a colleague or the like . In other embodiments the communication can be a communication originating within the device or otherwise from a local source. For instance in some embodiments the communication is an input generated by a user such as for example an image that the user has captured using an image capturing device which may in some instances be disposed within the mobile device. As shown at step an image detector determines whether the communication includes an image.

Upon determining that the communication includes an image the image is extracted as shown at step . At step a flagging module checks the image for a flag . In this manner the flagging module can determine for example whether the image previously has been scanned as shown at step by determining whether the image is flagged. If the image is flagged as shown at step the flag is examined to determine whether the flag indicates that the image includes mature content. If the image contains mature content a content restrictor blocks access to the mature content by a restricted user as shown at step . At step if the image does not include mature content the content restrictor allows a restricted user to access the image. If the image has not been flagged the image is scanned as shown at step and flagged as shown at step .

Turning now to an illustrative operating environment is depicted in which a content filter is implemented on a network element such as for example in a mobile network. According to various embodiments of the invention network element can include any number of different types of network elements such as for example servers switches routers and the like. In one embodiment for example network element includes a media access gateway MAG while in other embodiments network element can be a home server a preferences server or the like. The exemplary implementation shown in is an example of one suitable implementation and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the inventions disclosed throughout this document. Neither should the exemplary implementation be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement related to any single component or combination of components illustrated therein.

As shown in network element receives a communication that includes image and that originated at sending device . In embodiments the communication is received by image detector as shown by reference numeral . As is illustrated by reference numeral upon detection of image in communication image extractor receives communication and extracts image from it. Image scanner receives extracted image from image extractor as shown at reference numeral and scans the image.

As is further illustrated in image scanner or some other component of network element can be configured to determine whether an intended recipient of communication is in a restricted class. In an example image scanner may communicate an identification of the intended recipient to an age verifier as shown by reference numeral . In embodiments age verifier can include a program module application API function or the like for determining whether the intended recipient is old enough to view mature content identified in image . In some embodiments age verifier interacts with billing server to make this determination. For instance in some embodiments billing server includes billing records user profiles or other information that may include a date of birth or age of the intended recipient. As indicated at billing server can communicate this information to age verifier which can then provide an indication to content restrictor of whether the intended recipient belongs to a restricted class such as for example a class of people who are too young to view a certain type of mature content.

In embodiments content restrictor can provide any number of functions to restrict access to mature content identified in image . To achieve these ends similar to the environment illustrated in content restrictor may include blocker encryption and reporter . In embodiments content restrictor can retrieve alternate content from storage websites or some other location. As shown at content restrictor receives communication from image extractor where it can if appropriate reunite communication and image . In embodiments as shown at content restrictor creates a restricted communication by for example inserting restricted content into communication which is then forwarded through a messaging service to recipient s receiving device as shown at reference numeral . According to various embodiments of the invention restricted content can include image alternate content an encrypted version of image and the like.

To recapitulate embodiments of the inventions have been disclosed in the context of computer readable media a communications device a network environment and methods for restricting access to mature content. Turning now to a flow diagram is provided and shows an illustrative method of restricting access to mature content. In embodiments the method includes receiving a communication as illustrated at . In embodiments the communication can be an email a short messaging service SMS message a multi media messaging service MMS message an instant message or the like.

At a step an image detector determines that the communication includes an image. At step an image scanner determines that the image includes mature content. In some embodiments determining that the image includes mature content includes determining that the image has been flagged. The flag can be associated with the image and can include an indication that the image includes mature content. At a final illustrative step access to the mature content image is restricted. In embodiments restricting access to the mature content includes requiring a user to input a login credential before allowing the user access to the mature content. In other embodiments restricting access to the mature content includes removing the image from the communication before displaying the communication to a user. In some embodiments restricting access to the mature content includes replacing the mature content with alternate content wherein a user is allowed access to the alternate content.

Turning now to a flowchart depicts an exemplary method of restricting access to mature content. At a first illustrative step step a communication is received. At a second step step a determination is made that the communication includes an image. At step the image is scanned and determined to include mature content. At step the intended recipient of the image is identified. In embodiments network elements can interact with for example a billing server to verify the age of intended recipients. For example the age of recipient may then be compared against a threshold T to determine whether the age of the recipient is greater than or equal to the threshold as shown at step .

At step if the recipient s age is greater than or equal to the threshold e.g. if the recipient is an adult the recipient is allowed access to the communication with mature content. At step if the recipient s age is less than the threshold e.g. if the recipient is a minor the image is removed from the communication. In other embodiments the image can be left in the communication and can be encrypted. In some embodiments an access control list ACL can be associated with the image for controlling the access that various recipients might attempt regarding the image.

As shown at step in some embodiments the network element retrieves alternate content and as shown at step allows the recipient to access the communication with the alternate content provided instead of the mature content. In some embodiments the network element retrieves alternate content from an associated database or other data store. In other embodiments the network element retrieves alternate content from a remote source such as for example a third party vendor or advertiser. In some embodiments the network element replaces the portions of the image that include mature content with the alternate content. In other embodiments the alternate content is provided instead of the image. In various embodiments alternate content can include warnings alerts black censor blocks images text or the like.

At a final illustrative step the network element provides a report to the billing server. In embodiments the report includes an indication that mature content was detected in the image. Additional information can be included in the report as well such as for example a time stamp an identification of the intended recipient an identification of the sender and the like. It should be understood that instead of providing a report to a billing server the network element can provide reports notifications and the like to any other device server component or user. Such reports notifications and the like can include any number of different types of information related to the communication.

Turning now to a flowchart depicts an illustrative method of restricting mature content. At a first step step a communication is received. At step an image is detected in the communication. At step the image is scanned with a feature recognition component and determines as shown at step that the image include mature content. In embodiments the image scanner analyzes individual pixels of the image to detect portions of the image that appear to include mature content. According to embodiments of the invention for example the image scanner references one or more feature templates. In embodiments a feature template can include for example a data structure portion of computer code XML files or the like that include the representation of a feature. In various embodiments the features represented are features that have been designated as being mature content including mature content or being associated with the probability of being a portion of mature content.

With continued reference to at step a request from a user is received to access the image. In embodiments this request can be in the form of initiation of a process to open a communication such as a message. In other embodiments the request can be the consequence of the user pressing a send button on an email to which the user has attached the image. In other embodiments the request can be a consequence of the user initiating the attachment sequence to include the image in a message such as for example an email. At step a determination is made as to whether the user belongs to a restricted class.

If the user doesn t belong to a restricted class the image may be provided to the user. If the user does belong to a restricted class with reference to the type of mature content identified access to the mature content by the user is blocked as shown at step . If however the user does not belong to a restricted class in an embodiment the user can be authenticated as shown at step . At a final illustrative step step the user is allowed access to the mature content.

Turning now to a flowchart depicts an illustrative method of restricting mature content. At step a communication is received. At step an image is extracted from the communication. At step the image is scanned by referencing a plurality of feature templates to determine whether any portion of the image matches or is consistent with a feature represented by a feature template.

In embodiments of the invention as illustrated at step an image scanner determines that a first portion of the image is consistent with a first template which includes a representation of a feature of mature content that corresponds to a first restricted class. In embodiments the image scanner determines that a first portion of the image is consistent with a representation of a feature contained within the first template when the image scanner determines a difference between the portion of the image and the feature where the difference is within a predetermined range of magnitude. In another embodiment a portion of an image can be consistent with a feature template if the portion of the image has a certain number of items in common with the feature. It should be understood that in various implementations of embodiments of the invention the image scanner can compare images and feature templates using any number of suitable methods all of which are considered to be within the ambit of the present invention.

With continued reference to at step the image scanner determines that a second portion of the image is consistent with a second template which corresponds to a second restricted class. At step a verification module or the like determines that the recipient belongs to the first restricted class but not the second. At a final illustrative step the image is displayed to the recipient where the image includes the second portion but not the first portion. In this manner portions of images and or communications can be accessed by individuals that are members of some restricted classes but not others.

Turning now to a flowchart depicts an illustrative method of restricting mature content using a content filter deployed on a network element. At a first step a network element e.g. a server a MAG etc. receives a communication sent from a first device that is directed to a second device. In embodiments the communication can be directed to a particular recipient associated with the second device. According to embodiments of the invention the communication can be any type of communication that can be transmitted over a network such as for example an MMS message an SMS message e mail an instant message and the like.

At step the network element determines that the communication includes an image. At step the network element extracts the image from the communication. In embodiments the network element assembles the image using portions of the image that are included in a number of data packets intercepted by the network element. Accordingly in some implementations the network element assembles the image in a temporary buffer or other volatile storage. Various efficiencies can be designed into the network element so that the process of assembling and scanning images does not cause a noticeable delay in network traffic.

At step an image scanner implemented on the network element scans the image and determines that the image include mature content. At step the network element references a billing server to determine whether the recipient belongs to a restricted class. In other embodiments the network element can include an associated database that contains identifications of potential recipients e.g. network users and associated demographic information e.g. age address etc. . In some embodiments the network element can reference a different server a user device or the like to obtain information about the intended recipient. Upon determining that the recipient belongs to a restricted class as shown at step the network element restricts the recipient s access to mature content. At a final illustrative step step the network element forwards the communication to another network element or to the second device. In other words the network element having scanned and if applicable filtered the communication forwards the packets making up the communication to the next hop on its path to the second device wherever that may be.

Turning now to a flowchart depicts an illustrative method of restricting access to mature content included in a communication received at a computer via a data card on which aspects of a content filter are implemented. At a first step step the data card receives a plurality of packets that make up a communication. At step an image detector on the data card determines that the communication includes an image and as shown at step a module on the data card assembles the image from portions included in the plurality of packets. In some embodiments the data card can include a temporary buffer for storing the image as it is being assembled. At step an image scanner deployed on the data cards scans the image and determines that the image includes mature content. In some embodiments the data card can include storage that houses feature templates for use in scanning images.

At a final illustrative step step the data card notifies a connection manager installed on the associated computing device that the image includes mature content. In embodiments the data card can remove the image or the portion of the image that includes mature content from the communication before forwarding the communication to the computing device. In other embodiments the connection manager can remove the mature content remove the image encrypt the mature content or image apply an ACL to the mature content or image or provide alternate content to be rendered at the computing device.
