This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 454 098 filed on Mar. 18 2011.

This invention was made with government support under Army Contract SBIR A05 215 1758 and Phase 1 contract number N61339 06 C 0009 and Phase 2 contract N61339 06 C 0117 Army contract W91CRB 09 C 0056 and Army contract W91CRB 10 C00184. The government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates to medical simulation and in particular to trauma assessment and tourniquet cricoids and tension pneumothorax training systems devices and methods of using modular arms legs and torso parts that each include self contained simulators having realistic symptoms of bleeding pulse rates smells and the like so that students can be trained to both assess patient trauma and students can be trained to control bleeding through tourniquets and the use of digital communication devices for controlling the operations of the modular system parts for training purposes.

Various types of devices have been used as a limb hemorrhage trauma simulator over the years. See for example U.S. Patent Application Publication US 2009 0011394 to Meglan et al. which is generally limited to human limbs and mentions that light emitting diodes LEDs can be used but they are restricted to turning on particular LEDS or adjusting the intensity of the LEDS. However this simulator disclosed has limitations and problems.

This simulator requires that each limb be separately attached to an external computer device that includes an external simulator a controller a display and the like that appear to be a desktop computer and large display screen. Additionally this simulator does not describe controlling the flashing rate of the LEDS to cover different amounts of blood loss. Additionally this simulator has no description for monitoring a body torso. Furthermore this simulator does not allow for each limb to have its own stand alone simulator and controller and display built directly into the limb so that the limb parts can be separately used at the same time.

The Institute for Simulation and Training IST at the University of Central Florida and CHI Systems Inc. which includes the main inventors and assignee for the subject invention disclosed a simulation trainer between 2006 and 2009 with a haptic model having realistic visual and tactile feedback. However this demonstrated simulator was limited in use and applications.

The IST CHI Systems simulator was generally restricted to a single arm limb with some LED output similar to the Meglan et al. publication and a customized PDA personal digital assistant device having limited remote control capability that required preprogrammed software limited to controls for a single arm limb.

Other types of training devices have been disclosed over the years but also have similar limitations. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 852 893 issued to Smrcka on Dec. 10 1974 that describes a limb for a first aid training dummy molded of an integral skin foam shaped to define a simulated wound with a flexible plastic tube for supplying simulated blood. Aligned with the tube is a simulated bone which permits pressure to be applied to the wound or the tube to block the flow of simulated blood and U.S. Pat. No. 6 638 073 issued to Kazimirov et al. on October 283 2003 that discloses a model of a human being that includes a head unit a neck unit a trunk unit with upper and lower extremities connected together so as to be capable of movement. The training device also includes video simulators for the internal organs of a human being and traumas to the internal organs with the simulators connected to a computer.

These systems also focused on understanding the internal organs and practice on a dummy rather than training users to provide life saving procedures in the field prior to being transported to a medical facility. It is not enough to simply have a device in which to practice especially if such practice is performed incorrectly . Leveraging an entire training system includes devices as well as software to drive the training process.

Thus the need exists for solutions to the above problems with the prior art for training users to perform life saving triage in the field.

A primary objective of the present invention is to provide versatile extremities training systems methods and devices for teaching trauma assessment and tourniquet application skills and for teaching cricothyrotomy procedures having modular components of separate arms legs torso and head parts with each of the components having their own built in simulation controls that allow for separate teaching tools.

Further objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments which are illustrated schematically in the accompanying drawings.

Before explaining the disclosed embodiments of the present invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its applications to the details of the particular arrangements shown since the invention is capable of other embodiments. Also the terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.

The following is a list of reference numerals used in the description and the drawings to identify components 

Each of the modular pieces shown in is used for completing TASKS torso arms and and legs and simulate the human anatomy in that there is an inner support structure simulating the skeletal or bone structure an intermediate layer simulating muscle and fat covered with simulated outer skin. Each modular piece is designed and constructed to pass the rigors of medical assessment and intervention following the military training curriculum.

The skin can be made of SEBS styrene ethylene butylene styrene that gives a very realistic feel and resisted cutting and tearing with repeated contractions using a tourniquet. is a front view of the torso shown in with the upper and lower extremities arms and legs detached from the torso. is a side view of the torso of showing the universal joints for attaching the limbs to the torso. As shown the simulated arms preferably connect with the simulated torso at the shoulder joint while the simulated right and left leg attached to the torso at the simulated hip joint . is a bottom view of the torso of showing the simulation electronic module with a touch screen interface power on off switch and charging port.

The simulation electronic module can includes a computer processing device for executing a set of instructions stored in memory and interfaces in plural different input and output devices located throughout the simulated torso. As shown in the torso can include neck anatomy. and show a tubular neckband that can be coated to fill between the adjacent tubular bands to form simulated skin on the neck. Sections of one or more of the tubular bands can be filled with simulated blood and the coating can be made of a durable material for added protection to prevent damage. shows an example of a blood packet stencil used for producing blood packets. shows the spacing between adjacent blood packets produced from the stencil and shows an approximate volume of the blood packet for use with the tubular neckband for example.

Referring to the torso can include simulated lungs and can include simulated ribs above one or both of the lungs . In the example shown the right side of the torso can include ribs separating the right lung from the external simulated skin. For simulation purposes the torso can include right and left needle chest decompression sites and respectively. Simulation of the lungs can include a two stage lung platform as shown in . The two stage platform located under the simulated torso skin can include a balloon that inflates when a student applies sufficient pneumatic pressure via a Bag Valve Mask BVM or the like for cricothyrotomy procedures. A servo motor can be connected by a pivoting arm to the lung platform can be used to raise and lower the lung assembly to simulate normal breathing or asymmetrical breathing for tension pneumothorax procedures.

The needle chest decompression sites can be separated from the lung balloon to prevent damage to the balloon. The lung balloons are encapsulated within the platform by the rib cage on top having a support layer underneath which protects the lung from punctures. A 1.5 diameter recess will be in the optimum area for NCD which will house the sensor depicting the puncture and at what angle for future 3D modeling regarding internal anatomy. The lung balloons are custom shaped to accommodate this layout and still maintain the volume needed for insufflation.

This simulator was designed to replicate both form and function regarding the human anatomy such that repeated uses could be performed in a timely manner at an economizing cost over using animal or cadaver tissues. The torso can also include the neck anatomy . and show different simulated areas within the simulated neck anatomy . is a side view of the simulated torso showing the simulated neck anatomy collar including the bronchi branch foam simulated neck muscles and trachea stabilizer.

Referring to the torso CRIC has many components that can make up the head throat neck trachea cartilages bronchi branch and lungs. The simulated neck device can include sensors to monitor both head and bust positions to determine initial assessment and interaction during a test and sensors within nostrils or in the head to monitor any nasopharyngeal airway placement within the trial. The sensors can detect any movement or orientation with the simulator and can include but are not limited to 3 axis accelerometers and gyroscopes. These two types of sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes can work in tandem to keep the margin of error to a minimum. The novel neckband collar can have a plurality of segmented chambers side by side with one another that each can be filled with a red liquid such as food coloring and the like to simulate blood. Students can slit into each of the chambers to simulate a cricothyrotomies and the collar can be rotated about the neck for each student that is being trained. The fluid can be any type of fluid. For example soapy water can be mixed with a red food coloring since the soap is antibacterial.

Starting from the head down the skull can be made from the same very rigid urethane the neck support and the rest of the torso support. The head skin can be SEBS styrene ethylene butylene styrene because it can be formed fitted to slip over the skull and kept in place by a silicone neckband that houses the simulated blood plackets. This neck band shown in can be made from layers of silicone tape that is sprayed with pigmented silicone to match the head and torso skin color. The neck anatomy can have a foam filler for two reasons the first is to replicate the neck muscles and the second is to help align the trachea assembly.

An incision can be made on the neckband which will release a realistic volume of simulated blood for each trial and can be rotated easily for the next incision. A thin piece of plastic tape can be installed over the thyroid and sliding cricoids cartilage to act as the muscle ligament tissues between them to be penetrated once the incision is made through the neckband. A tracheal hook or the like can be inserted into the incision to pull up on the sliding cricoids cartilage to provide room for installing an endotracheal tube or the like. There can be internal sensors placed in the bronchi branch that give feedback on endotracheal tube placement which is critical for ventilation. There are sensors that can measure each lung volume during ventilation to determine bilateral symmetry proficiency. These types of sensors can include micro touch switches because the inventors wanted to block the nasal passage as well. In future models these could have IR sensors to pick up any object within the nostril and have an actuator to block off a nostril or two. There can also be sensors that are used that monitor both head and bust positions to determine the initial assessment and interaction during the trial. There are sensors within the nostrils for any nasopharyngeal airway placement within the trial. These types of sensors can also include accelerometers and gyroscopes that were previously described.

The thyroid can be formed from a thin walled rigid foam such as urethane while the cricoids cartilage can be made from a thin pliable foam such as urethane allowing for movement. The membrane holder can be formed from thin walled plastic tubing that fits nicely around the soft trachea tissues made of Silicone 20 that slides into the cartilages assembly . The bronchi branch can be made of the very rigid foam such as urethane and has plastic nipples screwed into it for lung fixtures. The lungs can be dipped Latex that are held in place within the chest cavity by a dense foam that conforms to the inside of the support structure.

Experimentally the trachea assembly went through many changes to find the right combination of materials that could be easily assembled for each new trial retain its shape under warm conditions and replicate the anatomy in form and function. The thyroid started as thin walled plastic but lost its shape over time and cracked. The material was changed to a pliable urethane which made inserting the trachea soft tissue difficult. The preferred material from the experiments was rigid urethane that provided the durability needed for simulation usage.

The cricoids cartilage that attaches to the thyroid was originally a thin wall plastic that failed. Next an aluminum strip was used however the aluminum strip cut through the air tube that is used for insufflation. Rigid urethane used for the thyroid was tested but the rigid urethane did not allow for the movement necessary when inserting the air tube. As a result of the experiments the preferred material for the cricoids cartilage is a pliable urethane that can be adapted into a sliding slot.

From experimentation the clasp on the neckbands have gone through a few changes such as thin molded plastic clips wire clasp hook and loop Velcro strips and metal spring clips. Although the Velcro worked best alternative fasteners can be substituted. The neckband with simulated blood packets has gone through design considerations such as multiple thin tubes filled with the blood and sectioned off incrementally. Another example used nano encapsulation bulbs but that had dismal bleeding effects when sliced.

Referring back to which shows a complete body layout of the simulator with snap in place simulated limbs include in the example shown a partially amputated left arm and an injured right arm a partially amputated right leg and a wounded left leg . Each of the simulated limbs can be snapped into the torso by universal joints electrical connectors for training use.

Each of the left arm simulator and right arm simulator parts can function as a stand along simulator without the torso. and show the touch screen interface to the simulation electronic module with on off switch and charge port . A training scenario for the left arm simulator can allow students to practice applying tourniquets to stop the bleeding from the simulated wound. When the tourniquet is not applied correctly the LED wound can be lit while correction application of the tourniquets results in the LEDs having a lower intensity be turned off or flash at a different rate to simulate a reduction in blood loss. Electronically the simulated left arm can include sensors for sensing application of the tourniquets in various areas. When the tourniquet is properly positioned the sensor s detects the application and the LEDs are extinguished. The types of sensors that can be used here include but are not limited to force sensors such as one manufactured by Flexiforce part A201. For the invention a sensor array was built with 16 sensors in a row covering almost 12 inches with a single ZIF connector.

The left and right arm simulator can each include an inner support structure that is formed of very rigid foam such as urethane that is baked in ovens for final curing to reduce shrinkage. In the preferred embodiment the intermediate layer for the muscle and fat layer can be a clear Silicone 40 and the skin can also be Silicone 40 that is pigmented to desired skin color depending on ethnicity. Similarly the torso skin was changed from SEBS to a pigmented Silicone 40 due to the same compression scenario as the arms and legs. The simulated wound can be made of clear foam such as urethane painted with luminous paint for the LED s to glow through. The control bezel that frames the skin in the control area can also be a pigmented foam such as urethane.

The LED wound arrangements can be located along the sides of the right arm the left arm the right leg and the left leg and have a column or columns to signal wounds. The LED arrangements can also be located along any other wound locations on the right arm the left arm the right leg and the left leg. The LEDs can flash together or in sequence or in different rates or in different intensities or on any combination thereof. The LEDs can go off as blood flow is restricted by the tourniquet applications.

Each of the simulated body parts the torso left and right arms and right and left legs can include one or more sensory arrays that include one or more rows of sensors mounted on a semi rigid backplane shown in that interfaces with the simulation electronic module corresponding to the body part. For example one or more arrays of sensors can be located along the left arm to detect pressure applied by a tourniquet within the range of the sensor. Based on the approximate distance of the tourniquet to the sensors the simulation electronics can cause one or more of the LEDs in the simulated wound to flash at a different or illuminate with a different intensity to simulate the amount of blood loss from the simulated wound with the tourniquet applied.

The computer control protocol supports querying capabilities of the devices defining parameters of the current training scenario and output of current simulation state of the simulator. In addition a number of commands are supported to configure aspects of the simulator such as but not limited to the Bluetooth and Wi Fi settings such as name SSID and the like .

An Application Programming Interface API supports application development using the simulator microcode. The API is a higher level communication scheme with each device and encapsulates the protocol that exists within the microcode itself. The API supports multiple devices and includes auto detection of the device. The API can connect to a leg arm and or torso and determine which device it is connected to. In addition the API supports application development across many different computer devices including conventional desktop personal computers as well as mobile communication devices such as but not limited to smart phones iPhone iPad and Android devices and even computer tablets. Advantages can include no stylus is required which could become lost especially in the field and these applications are much more popular than Windows PDA which is becoming obsolete. Alternatively the mobile applications can connect to the arm leg and torso devices through either Bluetooth or 802.11 Wi Fi connections.

Third the mobile app can actually drives the simulator itself. Through the use of the API and microcode protocol the mobile app allows the selection of the simulated environment. For example for the tourniquet training application it allows the selection of the body type time to bleed out and location of the injury. This is then communicated to the simulator which then simulates the scenario and reports back patient state.

To support the device and microcode itself a flash programmer was also developed to program the computer Programmable Integrated Circuit PIC . Somewhat different to other programmers this programmer was used to program the external flash chip that is used within the devices that provides necessary data to the device s operation. shows a schematic block diagram of the PIC 24. The PIC24 is the core of each simulator to be programmed in such a way the end user needs no special skills to operate each simulator but just interact with it for specific skills training.

The USB box is to show a physical serial connection to the PIC24 for updates or monitoring if needed. The Bluetooth box is to show it has Bluetooth radio connectivity to send and receive data wirelessly. The Wi Fi box is to show it has a Wi Fi radio to send and receive data wirelessly. SRAM box is for additional memory that can be used for programming and or storage. The LED box shows the PIC controlling the simulator LEDs function and the pulse box shows the PIC controlling the tactors for tactile stimulus as an output device. The pressure sensor box is representative of the sensor array that sends data to the sensor mux that parses this input to the PIC on an individual basis.

The IMU box can be made up of an accelerometer and gyroscope data that is pasted to the sensor mux for 3D data processing. The sensor mux allows for consolidating 8 inputs unto one input line to the PIC. The charge box represents the external charge port going to the battery although the charging function can become inductive in the future. The battery can be linked to the control head via the on off switch which powers the simulator and reports the status of charge. The LCD liquid crystal display box can be representative of the touch screen display that graphically illustrates the information pertinent to the simulators operation. The Control Head can be representative of the human interface area where the on off switch charge port and touch screen display are located to translate these functions into intuitive operations.

To support individualized training with or without the presence of an instructor we also invented a training component that provides task specific education in a series of modules that correspond with the selected training task. The training component can support multimedia training including but not limited to text audio video and or interactive quizzes. The training software can include a login by username and password with an administrative screen and records quiz scores in a database on a user specific basis. The database was designed to be queried by the training software to return competencies and deficiencies to create a framework for micro adaptive deliberate training that alters the course structure to improve learning outcomes on a user by user basis.

To support large training environments such as a classroom setting the present invention can include an aggregating computer software application referred to as the HapMed Hub. The mobile device described earlier works well with a single training set up whether a single device or a single body meant for a single trainee. In a classroom setting where there could be multiple devices all in one room the mobile device can be inadequate. In this scenario the hub system can coordinate all of the devices within the room. It can control multiple devices at once and provide an overall summary of current conditions of each device.

In addition the simulator can support multiple mobile devices connecting to it as well. This latter aspect allows the concept of an instructor walking through the classroom. For example he she could connect to a given trainee s station to see a current state of the simulation and then disconnect and re connect to a neighboring system. In addition the Hub can also notify the instructor to a trainee that may be performing poorly e.g. whose simulated patient may be perishing . Fundamentally the aggregating control hub addresses technical problems that arise from a multi device set up such as a classroom or lab.

Once the HapMed device is communicating with the simulated body or body part a start set up screen such as the screen shot shown in is displayed on the HapMed display screen. is an instructional screen shot instructing the student to put the head in the start position and shows an example of a screen shot displaying the result screen that is populated as the user administers the necessary life saving steps such as checking each nostril and showing the condition of each lung. The screen can also display whether or not the student inserted a tube and if the simulated patient was successfully resuscitated. After the simulation exercise is complete the user can reset the simulation.

Another simulation example is shown in . In this example the user first selects a wound location a simulated body size the time allowed before the simulated patient bleeds out and allows insertion of a time delay before the simulated medical emergency starts. In this example the simulated injury is a leg injury. When the simulation starts the display screen shows if a tourniquet has been used how many tourniquets are used if the bleeding has stopped and the status of the patient as shown in

The screen can also show the patient s blood pressure and the blood flow rate. When the simulation is complete the user can select discussion to receive a discussion of the results or can reset the simulator. shows a screen shot of the leg discussion screen on the HapMed. are shown various examples only those experience in the art of simulation will clearly understand that alternative simulation scenarios that can be presented.

The simulator can include travel cases for transporting and mobility so that the simulated body parts to remote location for training in the field. shows a case foam cutout for the left arm and right arm respectively with a pocket for the wireless control android to activate and control the left arm simulation a pocket for a stand to support the left arm during training and a pocket for tourniquets that can be used for training purposes.

While the invention has been described disclosed illustrated and shown in various terms of certain embodiments or modifications which it has presumed in practice the scope of the invention is not intended to be nor should it be deemed to be limited thereby and such other modifications or embodiments as may be suggested by the teachings herein are particularly reserved especially as they fall within the breadth and scope of the claims here appended.
