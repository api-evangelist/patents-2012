title: Microprocessor Shifter Circuits Utilizing Butterfly and Inverse Butterfly Routing Circuits, and Control Circuits Therefor
abstract: Microprocessor shifter circuits utilizing butterfly and inverse butterfly circuits, and control circuits therefor, are provided. The same shifter circuits can also perform complex bit manipulations at high speeds, including butterfly and inverse butterfly operations, parallel extract and deposit operations, group operations, mix operations, permutation operations, as well as instructions executed by existing microprocessors, including shift right, shift left, rotate, extract, deposit and multimedia mix operations. The shifter circuits can be provided in various combinations to provide microprocessor functional units which perform a plurality of bit manipulation operations.
