Borehole tools can acquire subsurface data to aid locating and mapping of boundaries e.g. bed boundaries between layers of material such as rock beds and for example to visualize and orient fractures and faults.

A borehole tool may be configured to acquire electrical borehole images. As an example the fullbore Formation MicroImager FMI tool Schlumberger Limited Houston Tex. can acquire borehole image data. A data acquisition sequence for such a tool can include running the tool into a borehole with acquisition pads closed opening and pressing the pads against a wall of the borehole delivering electrical current into the material defining the borehole while translating the tool in the borehole and sensing current remotely which is altered by interactions with the material.

Raw data can include multiple electrode readings caliper readings from individual pads or pairs of pads and x y and z axis accelerometer and magnetometer readings. Borehole deviation and a first pad e.g. pad for the tool orientation can be determined from magnetometers. A sample rate for electrode and accelerometer data can be on the order of about 120 samples ft 400 samples m .

Areal coverage of a borehole face can be a function of width of electrode arrays number of pads borehole diameter etc. As an example about 40 percent to about 80 percent of a borehole face may be imaged. Where data is not collected so called non imaged parts raw data may be separated by blank strips e.g. between adjacent pads on a resulting borehole log .

Processing of current data sensed remotely in response to delivery of current in a borehole can provide a map of resistivity of a rock fluid system at the borehole face e.g. cylindrical borehole surface . For viewing borehole data a line may be defined along a true north direction along which the cylindrical data is split between top and bottom and unrolled to provide a 2 D view. The line along which the cylinder is split may be any other geographical direction or may be the Top of hole or other such orientation.

For a boundary if planar and at a non orthogonal angle to the axis of the cylinder the intersection between the boundary and a cylindrical borehole is an ellipse e.g. in an extreme case a plane that is exactly perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder would give an exact circle . Upon unrolling the cylindrical image of the borehole surface image this oval is cut and open up as one cycle of a sinusoidal curve. Because the sinusoidal curve is part of an oriented image every part of it corresponds to an orientation and the lowermost part of the curve indicates the apparent dip slope azimuth direction . The amplitude of the sinusoidal curve corresponds to a dip angle relative to the borehole for example where the greater the amplitude the greater the dip angle relative to the borehole. On the other hand in an extreme case where the amplitude becomes zero i.e. a plane that is exactly perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder the plane would appear as a straight line in an unrolled 2 D view.

Processing can include creating a series of borehole images where color maps are applied to different bins or ranges of resistivity values e.g. for a tool that provides resistivity values . In the borehole image color pixels can be arranged in their proper geometric position representing a borehole surface. One convention provides that low resistivity features such as shales or conductive minerals or conductive fluid filled fractures or pore spaces are displayed as dark colors whereas high resistivity features such as hydrocarbon filled or well cemented sandstones and limestones are displayed as shades of yellow and white the higher the resistivity the brighter the image. As to a gray scale convention black may correspond to low resistivity and white to high resistivity.

Processed borehole images may be of a static type or a dynamic type. Static images are those which have had one contrast setting applied to the entire borehole which can provide useful views of relative changes in material resistivity. Dynamic images which have had variable contrast applied in a moving window can provide enhanced views of features such as vugs fractures and bed boundaries. Dynamic images tend to be better at bringing out subtle features in rocks that have very low resistivities such as shales and very high resistivities such as carbonates and crystalline rocks or in any rocks with low relative contrast between the beds and other features.

Described herein are various examples of technologies and techniques that may transform borehole data.

A method can include providing borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface defining one or more bedding planes based at least in part on the borehole data and transforming at least a portion of the borehole data to a planar slab format for a plane interior to the cylindrical surface. A system can include an interface to receive borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface a graphical user interface to align a sinusoidal graphic with respect to an image of the borehole data circuitry to project at least a portion of the borehole data to a plane interior to the cylindrical surface and circuitry to render a 2 D image of the plane that includes bedding planes derived from alignment of the sinusoidal graphic and projected borehole data. Various other apparatuses systems methods etc. are also disclosed.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The following description includes the best mode presently contemplated for practicing the described implementations. This description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but rather is made merely for the purpose of describing the general principles of the implementations. The scope of the described implementations should be ascertained with reference to the issued claims.

While in the example of the cylinder is a hollow cylinder composed of the data of the surface of the borehole the process may transform cylindrical surface data or other cylindrical data from material adjacent to a surface via one or more transformation techniques to provide a planar view of transformed data . As an example cylindrical data may be sparse for example depending on acquisition equipment technique etc. and where data are sparse interpolation may be applied to form a fuller data set e.g. to fill in a data set with interpolated values .

In the example of or various other examples data may be one or more of FMI data density based data acoustic data e.g. ultrasound data gamma ray data etc. As an example data may be acquired during a drilling process and optionally analyzed in near real time which may provide feedback for controlling the drilling process. As an example data may be acquired during a drilling process or after a drilling process and thereafter analyzed.

As shown the cylindrical surface data may be cut to provide two hemi cylindrical surfaces where data for one or both of these surfaces may be transformed to a planar surface. Along with the borehole deviation the azimuthal direction of the cut e.g. a selected plane parallel to a hole axis passing through the cylindrical surface data may determine whether the planar view of the transformed data illustrates true dip or apparent dip for planes of the formation . The azimuthal direction is explained with respect to see e.g. the convention and a particular convention that uses directions north east south and west which may be given in angles for example 0 degrees 90 degrees 180 degrees 270 degrees and 360 degrees respectively.

Various examples described herein pertain to petrophysical data. In general petra or petro refers to rock or other material e.g. subsurface material . A process may optionally be applied to other situations where a borehole is made and cylindrical surface data acquired. As an example consider a bore made into a tree where growth rings intersect the borehole e.g. as in the field of dendrochronology . In such an example one or more growth rings or other features may be handled akin to a bedding plane e.g. or other appropriate manner which may account for curvature etc. . Such an analysis may provide information as to climate e.g. weather rain temperature soil pH plant nutrition COconcentration etc. for different years which may infer climate variations. Other information such as fire insect volcanic activity earthquake etc. may possibly be derived as well.

As to the convention for dip as shown the three dimensional orientation of a plane can be defined by its dip and strike. Dip is the angle of slope of a plane from a horizontal plane e.g. an imaginary plane measured in a vertical plane in a specific direction. Dip may be defined by magnitude e.g. also known as angle or amount and azimuth e.g. also known as direction . As shown in the convention of various angles indicate angle of slope downwards for example from an imaginary horizontal plane e.g. flat upper surface whereas azimuth refers to the direction towards which a dipping plane slopes e.g. which may be given with respect to degrees compass directions etc. . Another feature shown in the convention of is strike which is the orientation of the line created by the intersection of a dipping plane and a horizontal plane e.g. consider the flat upper surface as being an imaginary horizontal plane .

Some additional terms related to dip and strike may apply to an analysis for example depending on circumstances orientation of collected data etc. One term is true dip see e.g. Dipin the convention of . True dip is the dip of a plane measured exactly perpendicular to strike see e.g. line directed northwardly and labeled strike and angle and also the maximum possible value of dip magnitude. Another term is apparent dip see e.g. Dipin the convention of . Apparent dip may be the dip of a plane as measured in any other direction except in the direction of true dip see e.g. as Dipfor angle however it is possible that the apparent dip is equal to the true dip see e.g. as Dip Dipfor angle with respect to the strike . In other words where the term apparent dip is used e.g. in a method analysis algorithm etc. for a particular dipping plane a value for apparent dip may be equivalent to the true dip of that particular dipping plane.

As shown in the convention of the dip of a plane as seen in a cross section exactly perpendicular to the strike is true dip see e.g. the surface with as Dip Dipfor angle with respect to the strike . As indicated dip observed in a cross section in any other direction is apparent dip see e.g. surfaces labeled Dip . Further as shown in the convention of apparent dip may be approximately 0 degrees e.g. parallel to a horizontal surface where an edge of a cutting plane runs along a strike direction .

In terms of observing dip in wellbores true dip is observed in wells drilled vertically. In wells drilled in any other orientation or deviation the dips observed are apparent dips e.g. which are referred to by some as relative dips . In order to determine true dip values for planes observed in such boreholes as an example a vector computation e.g. based on the borehole deviation may be applied to one or more apparent dip values.

As mentioned another term that finds use in sedimentological interpretations from borehole images is relative dip e.g. Dip . A value of true dip measured from borehole images in rocks deposited in very calm environments may be subtracted e.g. using vector subtraction from dips in a sand body. The resulting dips from such a process are called relative dips and find use in interpreting sand body orientation.

A convention such as the convention may be used with respect to one or more analyses see e.g. the analysis block of . As an example various types of features may be described in part by dip e.g. sedimentary bedding faults and fractures cuestas igneous dikes and sills metamorphic foliation etc. .

An example of cylindrical surface data is shown in for a plane passing through a cylinder where the minimum i.e. deepest measured depth point coincides with the direction north N . If the cylindrical surface data is cut along a longitudinal line running from north downhole to north uphole the cylindrical surface data may be presented in a 2 D format by unrolling the cylinder . The image thus created is a representation of the plane s intersection with the cylinder displayed versus azimuthal direction or angle e.g. 0 to 360 or N to E to S to W to N . In the unrolled cylinder 2 D format the plane that intersects the cylinder appears as a sinusoidal curve. In the example of the peak amplitude of this sinusoidal curve is at the direction south S . Given the diameter of cylinder e.g. or borehole the sinusoidal curve may be characterized as having a distance e.g. circumference from north to east to south to west to north.

In the example of any data indicative of material adjacent the borehole may likewise appear in a sinusoidal manner. Where multiple planes e.g. bedding planes intersect a borehole the entire image may be composed of multiple sinusoids which for example may or may not be parallel e.g. consider non parallel planes . Interpretation of data in a sinusoidal 2 D format may proceed in a manner different than that of a more common planar cross section format e.g. a core slab format of a solid core sample see e.g. the cut core sample of . Particularly in an unrolled cylinder 2 D format planes may generally appear as sinusoid curves whereas in true 2 D images i.e. a core slab format planes may generally appear as straight lines see e.g. the straight lines in the cut core sample of . Users interpreters may have decades of experience analyzing solid core samples in a core slab format however the applicability of such experience may be diminished when data are presented in a unrolled cylinder format where planes may appear as sinusoids e.g. data plotted in such a manner appears approximately sinusoid where the data represent planes .

As an example a dip picking process may be implemented to determine dip e.g. magnitude and azimuth of one or more planes and may be a part of a standard workflow when analyzing borehole data e.g. borehole images . In the example of the cylindrical surface data is data observed at the cylindrical surface of the drilled borehole and if viewed in three dimensions is a hollow cylinder. However once a plane is identified on this surface through analysis of the data e.g. by picking dip that plane an actual plane in 3 D space can represent absent data that runs through the borehole i.e. it transects the actual space within the hollow cylinder and therefore can represent absent data that would have existed in the hollow of the cylinder.

The cross section of may be a plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the borehole such that a rectangular view is obtained displaying the lines that represent the planes that transect the borehole that were picked from the cylindrical surface data by dip picking . This cross section may be called a true 2 dimensional 2 D section or a planar slab format . In the example of the data that transects the borehole are boundary data of these picked planes as the interior data may be classified as absent . As indicated in the example of the process of identifying bedding planes can provide information as to the dip angle of each of the planes at the respective depths. Accordingly the planar slab format does not include the data between various planes. In other words in the example of the slab format shows a series of identified planes and their respective angles it does not show data between planes which for example may be useful in characterizing material lying between adjacent planes.

An exploration process may include taking a solid core sample e.g. as a well is drilled followed by acquiring borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface. Further a borehole may be enlarged one or more times where additional borehole data is acquired and optionally solid annular core samples called sidewall cores . An analysis can include analyzing one or more sets of data and may include analyzing one or more solid cores e.g. solid cylinders or solid annuli .

The method is shown in in association with various computer readable media CRM blocks and . Such blocks generally include instructions suitable for execution by one or more processors or cores to instruct a computing device or system to perform one or more actions. While various blocks are shown a single medium may be configured with instructions to allow for at least in part performance of various actions of the method . As an example a computer readable medium CRM may be a computer readable storage medium.

In an example embodiment a method can include providing borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface defining one or more bedding planes based at least in part on the borehole data and transforming at least a portion of the borehole data to a planar slab format onto a plane interior to the cylindrical surface. In such a method transforming can include projecting data from the cylindrical surface to the plane. As an example the transforming can include projecting data from the cylindrical surface to the plane for regions between adjacent bedding planes.

In various examples borehole data can include resistivity data. Such data may be acquired with respect to a cylindrical surface that corresponds to a cylindrical surface of the borehole e.g. or a diameter of a borehole tool . In an example embodiment a method can include comparing transformed data in a planar 2 D slab format to a solid core slab sample.

As to types of data for example borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface can include image data and for example transformed borehole data may include image data. In an example embodiment borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface may be provided as pixel values.

One reason for expending substantial resources to take a core e.g. a solid core sample is to get a core slab for geological interpretation. A core slab provides a geologist views of material e.g. rock etc. in true 2 D as one would see in a road cut or in a reference manual or as an initial step to performing a geological interpretation. As mentioned a technique may be applied to borehole data to produce an image in a core slab format for example representative of an image of a true 2 D core slab.

In an oilfield drilled wellbores can be imaged using various electromechanical devices. As an example once images are acquired they may be visualized in a particular 2 D format via a visualization technique that may be described as an unwrapping of the borehole image cylinder such that all planar features appear sinusoidal. Such images may optionally be displayed in one or more 3 D formats. As mentioned a method may provide for representing borehole data in true 2 D in a slabbed core like format e.g. slab format for example by projecting features into an imaginary plane parallel to the axis of the borehole and filling in absent data on that imaginary plane.

As an example a process can include defining planes representing bed boundaries by picking dips at the bedding planes. Such a process can also include for example defining a direction of a section for a slab format. In such a process the direction may be a zonable parameter e.g. allowed to have different values as the dip changes noting that a direction may preferably be anywhere from a direction of apparent dip to a direction perpendicular to the apparent dip.

As an example once a section direction is defined picked bedding planes may be used as guides in displaying a 2 D image resembling a blank core slab for the particular orientation. In such a manner the bedding planes do not appear as sinusoids but rather they may appear as straight lines.

For a given sinusoidal 2 D image dips may be picked on boundaries defined by beds or other features attributes etc. of contrasting image pixels. In such an example the color pixel or other petrophysical property value s between two picked planes can be taken and applied between respective dip planes displayed in a 2 D image slab. Such a process can provide a core slab like image with bedding planes displayed as a sequence of lines with an appropriate color scheme as determined from the borehole images. Given such an image geologists can apply geological principles for interpretation just as would be applied for true 2 D core slab or images thereof.

As an example a process can include providing a sinusoidal image e.g. an image with one or more features appearing approximately as sinusoids picking dips and making geological interpretations based on dip patterns and optionally some visual interpretations from the sinusoidal image. Such a process may be enhanced by transforming the sinusoidal image data into a 2 D slab format image. Alternatively as an example a process may include providing a sinusoidal image picking dips and transforming the sinusoidal image data into a true 2 D slab format image for making geological interpretations and optionally some visual interpretations.

As an example a process may include use of one or more equations to transform data. As to parameters for a cylindrical coordinate system such equations may include a relative azimuth azi a sample depth Z a dip inclination dip a cross section angle XS e.g. in a N E or other convention and a radius r .

As to the relative azimuth azi as an example this may be determined by dividing a column number of an input array by approximately 360 e.g. 360 degrees . As to a sample depth Z e.g. for computation made by depth given the center of a borehole as a reference the depth of the sample may be defined by an offset compared to a current depth at the center of the borehole. Thus in such an example for each column of an input array of data e.g. from 1 to 360 at the depth Z the position of the value can be defined by the depth offset. In this example the depth offset is the offset between the depth where the dip is referenced e.g. center of an ellipse corresponding to the intersection between the hole and the dip plan and the depth of the intersection between the hole and the cylinder for each degree in N E direction starting at approximately 0 e.g. 0 degrees for N .

As to the distance of a sample from a center of the borehole which is at a radius r a value may be computed at a current depth by summing a caliper and a depth of investigation of a data acquisition tool. In such an example the radius r may be defined by the following equation 1 0.5 Caliper DOI 1 where r is the computed radius Caliper is the caliper value at the current depth and DOI is the depth of investigation.

As to the depth offset Z as an example it may be computed according to equation 2 as follow tan dip cos azi 2 where Z is the depth offset dip is the dip inclination i is the column number converted in degree of the input array data e.g. image array and azi is the azimuth of the dip plane.

Provided values from equations 1 and 2 position of data may be considered to be known such that determination of the position of the projected value on the cross section may proceed.

As an example for a new sample position a process can be cast as a trigonometry problem where resolution may implement the following equations 3 and 4 new tan dip cos azi 3 cos 4 where Z new is a new depth offset e.g. which can be used to determine position of the sample on the cross section x dip is the dip inclination i is the column number converted in degree of the input image azi is the azimuth of the dip plane XS is the cross section angle in N E convention and r is the radius.

An example embodiment may include one or more computer readable media that include computer executable instructions to instruct a computing system to receive borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface define one or more bedding planes based at least in part on the borehole data and transform at least a portion of the borehole data to a planar slab format for a plane interior to the cylindrical surface. Such an example may include instructions to instruct a computing system to render the transformed borehole data to a display and optionally instructions to instruct a computing system to analyze the rendered transformed borehole data.

As an example instructions may provide for selecting a direction of a plane interior to a cylindrical surface for purposes of transforming data to a slab format. For example a N S plane may be selected an E W plane may be selected etc. As an example a transformation may include projecting data from a west or an east direction to a N S plane projecting data from a north or a south direction to an E W plane etc. As an example a transformation may include averaging data from opposite directions projected to a selected plane. For example data may be projected from W to a N S plane and from E to a N S plane and then averaged to provide averaged data for the N S plane.

An example embodiment may include a system that includes an interface to receive borehole data organized with respect to a cylindrical surface a graphical user interface to align a sinusoidal graphic with respect to an image of the borehole data circuitry to project at least a portion of the borehole data to a plane interior to the cylindrical surface and circuitry to render a 2 D image of the plane where the 2 D image includes bedding planes derived from alignment of the sinusoidal graphic and projected borehole data.
