The disclosed embodiments relate to an electronic device and a method of generating a presentation. In particular the disclosed embodiments relate to a method of generating a presentation in accordance with a theme defining the graphical appearance and layout of the presentation.

Typically when designing a presentation using conventional presentation tools the author will design the presentation on an electronic device which has a display other than that with which the presentation will eventually be displayed to the audience. For example presentations are often designed on a desktop personal computer or on a tablet device both of which have high quality and highly reliable displays. However when the presentation is given to an audience it is usually displayed by a projector or on a much larger but low quality monitor.

When the presentation is given to an audience the quality of the display is key to audience enjoyment understanding interest and participation. A bad projector can ruin the best designed presentation. For example a dim projector or a poorly adjusted monitor may render the presentation almost impossible to read and carefully matched colours and contrast can be easily distorted. Other factors such as the ambient light in the room which may be coloured and the surface on which the display is projected can also significantly affect the readability of the presentation.

It is known to calibrate the settings of the display device in order to correct for global deficiencies in the display of the presentation however this may only alleviate certain ones of the potential issues and only to a certain extent. There is a need to address the issues caused by both poor quality projectors and the presentation environment in order to improve the readability of a presentation and therefore improve audience enjoyment understanding interest and participation.

According to one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a computer implemented method of generating a presentation in accordance with a theme defining the graphical appearance and layout of the presentation.

Public speakers giving talks in the business and education fields often make use of visual aids. Ever since the advent of Microsoft s PowerPoint program a common visual aid has been a slide based presentation consisting of a set of slides which are displayed to the audience. The term slide in the present context is a metaphor for the photographic slides small glass or plastic transparencies through which light was projected that prior to the digital information age were commonly used to display a sequence of images to audiences. The slides generated and shown via presentation software are actually digital information comprising text and images. Each slide generally acts as a visual aid to a portion of the talk given by the speaker. The speaker will advance through the set of slides as the talk progresses so that the audience sees the visual aid most relevant to that portion of the talk. The set of slides is usually referred to as a presentation or as a slide based presentation the two terms will be used interchangeably throughout the present description.

Generally the presentation is displayed to the audience on an external display that either reflects or emits light. Often a projector is used to project each slide onto a surface the audience can see such as a reflective screen designed for the purpose or even a bare wall the audience sees each slide as light reflected by the external display the screen or wall . Alternatively the presentation is displayed using a large monitor again suitable for viewing by the audience members such as an LCD LED or plasma monitor in such case the audience sees each slide as light emitted by the external display the monitor . An additional element of the presentation is typically a set of notes for the presenter. These notes are not displayed to the audience but may be shown on the electronic device so that only the presenter can see them.

Although the presentation may be displayed using a projector or a monitor the content of the presentation itself is often provided to the projector or monitor using a separate electronic device. It will be understood that the device may alternatively be integral with the projector or monitor. The separate electronic device may be in the form of a personal computer smartphone or tablet device such as those described above. The speaker may control the presentation using an input device integral with the separate electronic device or using a separate remote control.

A presentation program is a computer software package which is often used to generate and present a presentation. The functionality of such a program typically includes the ability to load and store presentations the ability to edit presentations by adding deleting and altering elements text images and other features such as bullets hyperlinks and buttons to trigger sounds or videos and modes of animating slides by for example revealing moving or hiding elements or transitioning between consecutive slides and the ability to show the presentation by means of an external display in either a fully automated manner a semi automated manner or a fully speaker controlled manner.

In a slide based presentation a presentation is made up of many slides each of which may provide a different arrangement of elements. Although slide based presentations are the most common type used the proposed solution is envisioned to be applicable to more complex presentations as well. For example a presentation may not be made up of a set of discrete slides but may instead be made up of one large continuous arrangement of elements that covers a larger area than the display and which may be traversed to display different regions of the arrangement of elements at a time. In another example embodiment the presentation may be dynamically generated where the arrangement of elements is automatically generated based on real time user input and context based intelligence and therefore the slide is simply the current arrangement of elements being presented.

In a slide based presentation a theme defines the layout of the content elements on the slide as well as the graphical appearance of each content element. For example the theme may define that if a slide is to have a title it is to be placed along a central vertical axis of the slide and substantially near to the top when the slide is displayed. The theme may also define that the title may have a particular font face font size font weight and colour and may or may not be placed in front of a coloured background region.

It will be understood that the above are merely examples and it will be clear that there are any number of characteristics possible that may define the graphical appearance and layout of a presentation. The characteristics of the elements can be set independently. For example single paragraphs and images can have a different appearance. Paragraphs with different settings can be rendered on the same slide.

As described above there may be a number of factors which affect the display of the presentation to the audience for example a bad quality or poorly adjusted projector or monitor ambient light or the reflective properties of a surface on which the slides are projected. The example embodiments described herein seek to prevent those issues from affecting the visual appeal of the presentation. This is done by displaying a predetermined test or calibration image and capturing how this is displayed to the audience. The test image contains components that make it possible to identify the quality of the display in terms of certain parameter. The test image the parameters and the analysis of quality will be described in more detail below.

Depending on the values of the parameters measured a presentation theme is selected from a collection of predetermined themes which rather than globally compensating for the deficiencies in the display for example in the manner of classic colour compensation sets the theme of the presentation so that a visually impressive presentation is produced that factors in how the presentation will look to the audience. Instead of selecting a theme from a collection of predetermined themes a previously selected theme may also be modified to improve the visual look and feel of the presentation.

A flow diagram illustrating the above concepts from the perspective of the overall system is illustrated in . Firstly at step the test image is displayed. At step a picture is taken using a built in camera of the device. At step the test parameters are calculated and a suitable presentation theme is selected. At step the stored presentation is shown using the selected theme.

In a similar representation to which is described above depicts an electronic device being used to capture a digital image of the test image displayed on a reflective screen using a projector . The illustration shows a rear internal camera of the device taking a digital image of the projection as it is displayed. The digital image is subsequently used in the analysis process to determine the state of the display.

Although it is depicted that the rear camera of the device may be used to capture the image it will be understood that the front facing camera could also be used and alternatively an independent camera which is in communication with the device either using a wired or wireless communication connection It is also contemplated that a stereoscopic camera may be used.

It has been described above that a test image may be analysed to determine the quality of the display and the potential affect it will have on a presentation subsequently displayed. illustrates an exemplary test image which may be generated by the method described above in the context of . The test image itself is intended to be of substantially the same size as the presentation such that the display can be measured across the range needed. The exemplary test image may include the following features.

Firstly the test image may include four markers placed in all corners or substantially near all corners in order to detect if the output is clipped and also to detect the aspect ratio i.e. the width height ratio of the display region. Secondly the test image may include three coloured regions and in order to measure colour quality and discrepancies between the observed output and the expected output. In the different coloured regions and are illustrated through hatching. Preferably the three regions and are red green and blue to measure primary colour quality. The regions and are illustrated as square however this may not necessarily be the case.

Further the test image may include a number of basic shapes and . In a preferred example these shapes may be geometric shapes and even more preferably may be regular polygons. Examples of contemplated shapes include a square an equilateral triangle and a circle . These shapes may be used to measure if the output is stretched when displayed. The shapes may also be the coloured regions although this example is not shown. Other elements of the image may be used to detect skew or stretch and so these regular polygons or shapes are optional.

The test image may further comprise an image with only black and white pixels which may be used to measure the ratio between minimum and maximum brightness i.e. the contrast.

The analysis of the captured digital image aims to determine how these aspects of the test image appear when displayed. In addition to analysing the parameters of the image the analysis may also determine the image sharpness or focus. This aspect heavily impacts how readable text is and text readability is arguably the most important factor in making a presentation audience friendly.

The analysis of the captured digital image carried out by the presentation engine utilises computer vision techniques and algorithms in order to measure certain parameters of the test image. It is important to note than any techniques or algorithms may be used to determine the quality of the display. Exemplary computer vision techniques will now be described which merely show a number of ways in which the parameters may be identified. Other methods of analysis are envisaged but not described.

Firstly the engine may need to identify the test image. The test image should be as unique as possible so the algorithm does not find false positives. A common method of identification is to use Scale Invariant Feature Transform SIFT or Speeded Up Robust Feature SURF SURF . However these algorithms are quite slow. An alternative and faster method may be to use Features from Accelerated Segment Test FAST to detect the rectangle of the projected image or TV screen. If the camera is pointed directly at the projected image or monitor it should be bright enough so that the outline of the image is easily identified by FAST. FAST will usually detect more than one rectangle and the engine will then need to determine which is the correct one. Rectangles that are very small or have extreme aspect ratios can be instantly discarded although the engine may end up with more than one.

The user of the device may need to ensure that all parts of the test image are picked up by the camera for good results. To do this the user may be presented with the detected image for confirmation once the engine has identified the test image from the captured digital image. If the test image has not been identified correctly the user may be requested to restart the process or move locations when capturing the image.

Once a set of potential test images has been found the engine may need to project the images from 3D to 2D. This can be done by calculating the homography of the subset of the camera feed that identified as the test image.

Further it may be possible to use marker detection which is commonly used in augmented reality applications. It is enough that the engine detects a part of the test image since it is in the same plane as the rest of the image.

Once the engine has identified the test image in 2D the engine is operable to determine the different parts of the test image by using object detection. Contemplated object detection algorithms include those described as part of OpenCV.

Once the engine has identified all of the different parts of the test image the engine can analyse the individual components to determine the quality of the monitor or projected image. The following are examples of this analysis.

The edges of the monitor or projected image have been determined using the steps above. Therefore if there is a corner marker missing then the engine is able to determine that the image is clipped or obscured. If the image is obscured the user should address this before running the algorithm. To address the clipping the engine is operable to adjust the output in small increments until the image is no longer clipped. The user may have to let the algorithm run for a few seconds while it takes an image analyses it adjusts settings and then start over until the calibration is complete. It may also be possible to measure the width or height of the image in the middle of the test image and determine exactly how much the engine needs to calibrate and perform the calibration in just one step.

To determine if the output is stretched the engine can first make sure that the image isn t clipped and then look at the aspect ratio. If the aspect ratio is wrong then the engine can adjust the output to get a 4 3 or 16 9 image as desired.

Contrast can be determined by calculating a histogram of luminance values of pixels of the captured image. The difference between the darkest and the brightest pixels is used to determine the contrast. The engine may have to take exposure time into consideration when determining the contrast.

The three squares of the test image that are red green and blue are used to determine colour quality. To determine the colour quality the engine may calculate the average of all pixels in a square and look at the Red Green and Blue RGB values of the pixels to determine how bright the three colours are. The white parts of the test image can be used to calibrate the white balance and ensure that the RGB values from the camera are realistic enough.

When measuring the image sharpness if the blurriness is above a certain threshold then the algorithms described here may fail. However this shouldn t be a problem since this will be very obvious to the presenter and the projector can then be manually adjusted. In this situation a warning may be presented to the user. Once the display is sharp enough the algorithms can take care of making sure the text is readable. For instance the engine could measure the readability by looking at the intensity of the edges of the square or other shape that is in the reference image. If the edges are not sharp they may appear to be a gradient. The blurriness is based on the length of the gradient.

As was described above a stereoscopic camera may be used to detect the test image. The engine may use this camera to detect the distance from the device to the displayed test image and therefore calculate the actual physical size of the monitor or projected image.

The engine has now determined the characteristics of the test image through computer vision techniques. The next step is to select or modify the theme for the presentation. Exemplary variable aspects of the theme are described above and as mentioned other aspects are contemplated. Examples of how the theme may be selected or modified based on the identified characteristics of the test image will now be described.

It is worth noting that individual content elements may be given certain characteristics as part of the theme independently of other content elements even if they are of the same type. For example paragraphs with different settings can be rendered on the same slide. Various uses for this are contemplated. In one example ambient light affects only the bottom half of the display. The text elements which the theme determines should be placed there may be given a darker font colour or a larger weight so that the text elements are more readable for the audience.

In a first example if the contrast is detected to be low or the projector or monitor is determined to have poor brightness then the theme may be selected or modified in the following ways.

Firstly to compensate for poor contrast the theme may increase contrast of images favour heavier fonts and or favour highly contrastive background and text colours such as black on white or white on black . For example a selected theme may favour boldfaced text to non boldfaced text a previously selected theme may replace a fontface having thin strokes with a font having thicker strokes.

Further a large font size can be used in the theme or the font size of an existing theme can be increased. By increasing the font size of a previously selected theme the layout of the theme and the slide transitions may need to be changed since fewer elements can be shown on the external display at the same time. Similarly a theme may be selected with a large font size and a layout and slide transitions that take account of the large font size.

In a second example the image analysis looks at the red green and blue regions of the test image. The subsequent analysis determines the brightness of the three colours as described above. The engine may be operable to use this information to select a theme where the colours can be accurately represented. For instance a theme which is predominantly yellow might not work very well if the red or green colour channel is reproduced poorly. In a further example the engine may determine that the colours that will be displayed are not sufficiently distinguishable. For example the presentation may include a chart which has graph lines of red and orange. The analysis of the captured image may calculate that the two colours may not be distinguishable because the green is not bright enough resulting in an orange that tends closer to red. The engine may replace the orange graph line with a blue graph line in order to distinguish adequately between the colours.

In a third example the analysis may have determined that the image is blurry and out of focus. If it is not possible to solve this problem by adjusting or moving the projector then the theme could be selected or adjusted to use a large or larger font size. The large font allows the text to be readable even though it is blurry.

In a further example the markers of the test image may be used by the analysis to determine the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio for example 4 3 or 16 9 will affect how the layout of the theme will look. Based on the determined aspect ratio the engine may be operable to select a theme from the collection of predetermined themes which is optimised for use on that aspect ratio. Additionally the engine may be operable to adapt the layout to fit the current aspect ratio in two ways. The first is small adjustments for example if the bounding rectangle for a paragraph becomes narrower then line breaks will change to accommodate for the smaller width and the title might have to use a smaller font. The engine may also use the predetermined themes as the base for the layout and then do small adjustments for other ratios would probably work very well for example a 16 9 theme may be used as a template with small optimizations to fit a 16 10 ratio.

The embodiments described above are merely illustrative of particular implementations and are not meant to be restrictive. Various adaptations modifications and combinations of the described embodiments can be made while remaining within the scope of the claims appended.
