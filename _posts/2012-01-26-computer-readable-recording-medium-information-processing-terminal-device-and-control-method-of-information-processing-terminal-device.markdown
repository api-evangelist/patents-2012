The data sharing button is a button for inputting a data sharing command for instructing data sharing between the gallery application and another application.

In STEP S the CPU determines whether any sharing command has been input by the user. Specifically the CPU determines whether any data sharing button has been touched by the user. In a case where any data sharing command has not been input NO in STEP S the operation returns to STEP S. Meanwhile in a case where a data sharing command has been input YES in STEP S the CPU displays a list of candidates for a destination application for data sharing on the panel .

if it is determined that the print application has been selected as an application to share image data in STEP S the CPU issues a start instruction. The start instruction is a command for starting the print application Then the flow is finished.

An operation of the CPU based on the print application will be described with reference to . If receiving the start instruction in STEP S the CPU starts the print application Next the CPU acquires the direction of the portable phone and stores the direction of the portable phone in the storage unit .

Examples of the image data requiring an external conversion process include image data having a portable document format PDF . In a case where any external conversion process is not required NO in STEP S the operation proceeds to STEP S and in a case where an external conversion process is required YES in STEP S the operation proceeds to STEP S.

In STEP S the CPU acquires a current direction of the portable phone . In STEP S the CPU determines whether the current direction of direction of the portable phone is the longitudinal direction. In a case where it is determined that the current direction is the vertical direction the operation proceeds to STEP S in which the CPU fixes the direction of the portable phone to the vertical direction. Specifically the CPU outputs an instruction for fixing the direction of the portable phone to the vertical direction to the operating system Therefore in a case of changing a posture of the portable phone from the vertical direction to the horizontal direction during the process of generating print preview display image data to be described below until generation of horizontal print preview display image data is completed vertical print preview display image data cannot be generated.

Meanwhile in STEP S if it is determined that the direction of the portable phone is not the vertical direction NO in STEP S the operation proceeds to STEP S in which the CPU fixes the direction of the portable phone to the horizontal direction. Therefore in a case where the posture of the portable phone is charged from the horizontal direction to the vertical direction during the process of generating the print preview display image data until generation of horizontal print preview display image data is completed print preview display image data according to the vertical posture cannot be generated.

In STEP S the CPU acquires the plural pieces of image data on the basis of the file path acquired in STEP S and stores the image data in the storage unit .

In the print application it is possible to generate the print preview display image data on the basis of the direction of the portable phone during the start of the generation of the print preview display image data until the generation of the print preview display image data is completed. Therefore for example even if the user unintentionally changes the direction of the portable phone during the process of generating the print preview display image data a process of generating print preview display image data according to the changed direction of the portable phone can be prevented from being performed from the beginning. As result the portable phone can receive a user s manipulation even before the process of generating the print preview display image data image before a process of generating print preview display image data is completed and it is possible to prevent an increase in a waiting time until the print preview display image data is displayed.

Further in the print application the image data is stored in the image data storage area In this case generally the time required for the process of storing the image data in the image data storage area is larger than the time required for the process of generating the print preview display image data from the image data. Therefore in the print application in a case whether the user unintentionally changes the posture of the portable phone in the middle of performing the process of storing the image data in the image data storage area a process of storing image data in the image data storage area according to the changed direction can be prevented from being performed from the beginning. As a result it is possible to prevent an increase in the waiting time until the print preview display image data is displayed.

In a case where plural pieces of image data have been acquired the time required for various processes such as a process of generating print preview display image data becomes longer as compared to a case of acquiring one piece of image data. However in the print application in a case of acquiring plural pieces of image data in STEP S or STEP S a process of fixing the direction of the portable phone is performed. Therefore for example even if the user unintentionally changes the direction of the portable phone during the process of generating the print preview display image data a process of generating print preview display image data according to the changed direction of the portable phone can be prevented from being performed from the beginning.

A fifth embodiment will be described. The fifth embodiment relates to an operation after generation of print preview display image data is completed. The fifth embodiment is a modification of the operation of the print application according to the fourth embodiment. A communication system used in the fifth embodiment is the same as the communication system according to the first embodiment and thus the redundant description will not be repeated.

The flow of starts after the generation of the plural pieces of print preview display image data is completed according the flows of the follows of the first to third embodiments or the like. In STEP S the CPU acquires a file path for accessing the current displayed print preview display image data if it is determined that the direction of the portable phone has been changed. In STEP S the CPU acquires the direction of the image data which is the source of the print preview display image data. For example in a case where the format of the image data corresponds to the Exif format the direction of the image data which is the source of the print preview display image data may be read from metadata added to the image data.

In STEP S the CPU determines whether the direction the vertical direction or the horizontal direction of the print preview display image data acquired in STEP S corresponds to the direction the vertical direction or the horizontal direction of the changed direction of the portable phone . In a case where the direction of the print preview display image data acquired in STEP S corresponds to the direction of the changed direction of the portable phone YES in STEP S the operation proceeds to STEP S and in a case where the direction of the print preview display image data acquired in STEP S does not correspond to the direction of the changed direction of the portable phone NO in STEP S the operation proceeds to STEP S.

In STEP S the CPU displays a confirmation message asking whether to display the print preview display image corresponding to the changed direction of the portable phone on the panel . Further the CPU receives a command input for displaying the print preview display image corresponding to the changed direction. In STEP S the CPU determines whether any command input has been received. In a case where any command input has not been received NO in STEP S the operation proceeds to STEP S in which the CPU ignores the change in direction of the portable phone . Then the operation returns to STEP S. The detailed contents of the process of ignoring the change in direction of the portable phone is the same as the contents of the process of STEP S of the second embodiment and thus the redundant description will not be repeated.

Meanwhile in a case where a command input has been received YES in STEP S the operation proceeds to STEP S. In STEP S the CPU generates the print preview display image data. Further in STEP S a process of fixing the direction of the portable phone is performed before the generation of the print preview display image data and a process of releasing the fixing of the direction of the portable phone is performed after the generation of the print preview display image data. In STEP S the CPU displays the print preview display image based on the print preview display image data corresponding to the changed direction. Then the operation returns to STEP S.

The effects of the print application according to the fifth embodiment will be described. In the case where the changed direction of the portable phone does not correspond to the direction of the print preview display image data it can be considered that it is highly possible that the user unintentionally erroneously changed the direction of the portable phone . For this reason in a case where a command input regarding whether to generate the print preview display image data corresponding to the changed direction of the portable phone is received the CPU generates the print preview display image data according to the changed direction of the portable phone . Therefore even in the case where the user unintentionally changed the direction of the portable phone since the process of regenerating the print preview display image data is not immediately started it is possible to efficiently perform the process of displaying the print preview display image data.

In the embodiments a case where the CPU generates the print preview display image data on the basis of the print application preview display image generating program has been described. In other words a case where the CPU operates by the print application has been described. However the present invention is not limited thereto. For example the CPU may generate print preview display image data on the basis of a preview display image generating program of the operating system In this case the print application may output an instruction for generating a preview display image and the API may generate a preview display image on the basis of the instruction. Alternatively for example a preview display image generating circuit may generate print preview display image data. In this case the portable phone may include a hardware component like the preview display image generating circuit. Further the print application may output an instruction for generating a preview display image and the preview display image generating circuit generates a preview display image on the basis of the instruction.

The processes performed by the CPU in STEP S of the third embodiment is not limited to the thinning and reduction processes. For example in a case where the data size of the print preview display image data corresponding to the direction different from the current direction of the portable phone is smaller than the data size of the print preview display image data corresponding to the current direction of the portable phone the CPU may perform an enlargement process based on pixel interpolation on the print preview display image data having the smaller data size.

The method of acquiring image data in STEPS S and S of the first embodiment or the like is not limited to the sharing of image data. Image data may be acquired by a process of reading the image data from the storage unit such as an SD card .

In the first embodiment in the case where it is determined in STEP S that there is plural pieces of image data to be shared with the gallery application the direction of the portable phone is fixed STEP S or S . However the present invention is not limited thereto. Even in a case where there is one piece of image data for example if the data size of the image data is large or the process takes a long time the direction of the portable phone may be fixed.

The process of fixing the direction of the portable phone may be performed in various forms. For example as in STEP S of the second embodiment the direction of the portable phone may be fixed by ignoring information on the direction of the portable phone received from the operating system

The start instruction received by the CPU in STEP S is not limited to the start instruction issued in STEP S . For example the start instruction may be a start instruction based on an input by the user such as clicking on an icon displayed on the panel according to the print application

In STEP S the CPU may acquire the direction of the portable phone detected by the tilt sensor on the basis of the print application without involvement of the operating system and store the direction of the portable phone in the storage unit .

In STEP S the determination on whether the direction of the portable phone has been changed may be performed according to the following modification. First on the basis of the print application whenever the direction of the portable phone is regularly notified from the operating system the CPU may determines whether the notified direction of the portable phone is different from the direction of the portable phone acquired in STEP S thereby determining whether the direction has been changed.

In STEP S a case of performing a determination based on the data size of the print preview display image data has been described however the present invention is not limited thereto. For example the determination may also be performed on the basis of the size of a preview display area.

In the fourth embodiment STEPS S to S may be omitted. In this case with respect to the current displayed print preview display image it is possible to display a print preview display image according to the current direction of the portable phone.

In the fifth embodiment STEPS S to S may be omitted. In this case in the case where it is determined that the direction of the print preview display image data does not correspond to the changed direction of the portable phone NO in STEP S the CPU performs the process of ignoring the change in direction of the portable phone in STEP S.

The technical elements described in the specification or the drawings can exhibit technical usefulness either alone or in combination and combinations are not limited to those described in the claims as filed. The techniques illustrated in the specification or the drawings can achieve a plurality of purposes at the same time and achieving only one of them has technical usefulness.

Claims are described using the expression of instruction that causes a unit to perform a curtain process such as an acquisition control instruction a generation control instruction a display control instruction and a storage control instruction. Here a description causing a curtain unit to perform various process does not necessarily express only that a computer such as the CPU performs various processes on the basis of an image processing program such as the print application . The description includes a format in which the computer outputs instructions for instructing various processes to an operating system and hardware components such as the panel .

Each unit such as the generating unit the display unit the first acquiring unit the second acquiring unit the first storing unit the second storing unit the first receiving unit and the second receiving unit may be hardware and a means implemented by execution of a driver in a program according to the present invention or the operating system or another program or only hardware. The driver may be a collection of a plurality of programs.

According to the image processing program in a case of making the computer function as each means it is possible to make the generating unit generate the display image data on the posture of the information processing terminal device during the start of the generation of the display image data until the generation of the display image data by the generating unit is completed. Therefore even if the user unintentionally changes the posture of the information terminal device during the process of generating the display image data it is possible to prevent a process of generating a display image data according to the changed posture of the information processing terminal device from being performed from the beginning. As result the information processing terminal device can receive a user s manipulation even before the process of generating the display image data before a process of generating a display image data is completed and it is possible to prevent an increase in a waiting time until the display image data is displayed.

Further it is possible to make image data shared between an application program and the image processing program. Therefore it is possible to make the first acquiring unit acquire one or more pieces of image data by sharing the image data.

According to the image processing program the acquisition control unit may make the first acquiring unit and the storing unit perform a process of acquiring the image data and a process of storing the image data. If the acquiring process and the storing process are performed as described above the time required for the process becomes longer as compared to a case of performing only the acquiring process. However according to the image processing program for example even in a case where the user unintentionally change the posture of the information processing terminal device while the acquiring process and the storing process are being processed it is possible to prevent the acquiring process and the storing process from being reperformed from the beginning. Therefore it is possible to prevent an increase in the waiting time until a display image data is displayed.

In a case where there the first acquiring unit acquires a plural piece of image data the time required for the process becomes longer as compared to a case of acquiring only one piece of image data. However according to the image processing program for example even in a case where the user unintentionally change the posture of the information processing terminal device while the acquiring process and the storing process are being processed it is possible to prevent the acquiring process and the storing process from being reperformed from the beginning. Therefore it is possible to prevent an increase in the waiting time until a display image data is displayed.

Further according to the image processing program if a display image data is generated once since the display image data is stored it is possible to avoid the trouble of having to regenerate the corresponding display image data. Therefore it is possible to display the display image data more quickly and to improve the convenience for the user.

Moreover according to the image processing program even in a case where the posture of the information processing terminal device is changed while a display image data is generated it is possible to prevent the process of generating a display image data from being reperformed from the beginning. Therefore it is possible to prevent an increase in the waiting time until a display image data is displayed.

Moreover according to the image processing program it is possible to regenerate a display image data from the already generated display image data. Therefore it is possible to display the display image data more quickly.

Also according to the image processing program even in a case where the posture of the information processing terminal device is changed while display image data is being displayed it is possible to regenerate display image data according to the changed posture of the information processing terminal device from the currently displayed display image data.

Further according to the image processing program even in a case where the posture of the information processing terminal device is changed while display image data is being displayed it is possible to regenerate display image data according to the changed posture of the information processing terminal device sequentially from display image data which is likely to be subsequently displayed display image data having a number close to the currently displayed display image data . Therefore it is possible to prevent an increase in the waiting time until display image data is redisplayed.

According to the image processing program in a case where the direction of the information processing terminal device determined by the changed posture of the information processing terminal device corresponds to the direction of the display image data it can be considered that it is highly possible that the user intentionally changed the direction of the information processing terminal device. In this case according to the information processing program an instruction for instructing generation of display image data according to the changed posture of the information processing terminal device may be output to the generating unit. Therefore it is possible to effectively perform a process of displaying the image data.

In a case where the direction of the information processing terminal device determined by the changed posture of the information processing terminal device does not correspond to the direction of the display image data it can be considered that it is highly possible that the user unintentionally and erroneously changed the direction of the information processing terminal device. In this case according to the image processing program display image data according to the changed posture of the information processing terminal device may be generated in a case where a command input regarding whether to generate the display image data according to the changed posture of the information processing terminal device is received by a receiving unit. Therefore even in the case where the user unintentionally changes the posture of the information processing terminal device since the process of regenerating the display image data is not immediately started it is possible to effectively perform a process of displaying the display image data.
