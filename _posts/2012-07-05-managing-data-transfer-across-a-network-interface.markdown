The present matter relates to communication devices and in particular to a method and system for managing data transfer across a communication device to a communication network over a wireless connection.

Communication devices are commonly used to transmit data across communication networks including cellular networks. Often cellular networks have protected zero rated or data sensitive connections that can only be used by authorized applications and processes. Data including audio or other data can be transmitted across such protected connections from one or more applications or processes on a device.

According to an aspect the present disclosure describes a method implemented on a communication device for managing data transfer from the communication device to a communication network over a wireless connection the method comprising determining that a requesting process on the communication device is authorized to transfer data to the communication network over a protected connection and configuring a network interface on the communication device to allow data packets to be transferred from the requesting process to the communication network over the protected connection wherein the network interface is associated with the protected connection.

According to another aspect the present disclosure describes a communication device for managing data transfer from the communication device to a communication network over a wireless connection the communication device comprising an authorization process module for authorizing a requesting process to transmit data to the communication network over a protected connection and a cellular data services controller for configuring a network interface on the communication device to allow data packets to be transmitted from the requesting process to the communication network over the protected connection wherein the network interface is associated with the protected connection.

According to another aspect the present disclosure describe a communication device for controlling data transfer across a network interface of a communication network the communication device comprising a memory and computer readable instructions stored on memory and executable by a processor to determine that a requesting process on the communication device is authorized to transfer data to the communication network across a protected connection and configure a network interface on the communication device to allow data packets to be transmitted from the requesting process to the communication network over the protected connection wherein the network interface is associated with the protected connection.

According to another aspect the present disclosure describes a computer readable storage medium comprising computer executable instructions which when executed cause a processor to determine that a requesting process on the communication device is authorized to transfer data to the communication network across a protected connection and configure a network interface on the communication device to allow data packets to be transmitted from the requesting process to the communication network over the protected connection wherein the network interface is associated with the protected connection.

For convenience like numerals in the description refer to like structures in the drawings. Referring to a typical telecommunication infrastructure is illustrated generally by numeral . The telecommunication infrastructure includes one or more communication devices one or more base stations a communication network and a plurality of network servers .

The communication devices include wireless computing devices such as a smart phone a personal digital assistant PDA and the like. The communication devices are in communication with one of the base stations . The base stations relay data between the communication devices and the network servers via the communication network . Accordingly the communication network may include several components such as a wireless network a relay a corporate server and or a mobile data server for relaying data between the base stations and the network servers .

The network servers include servers such as a Web server an application server and an application server with web services. It will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the telecommunication infrastructure described herein is exemplary and that changes may be made to one or more components to accommodate different network configurations without affecting the scope of the aspects described herein.

Referring to a typical communication device is illustrated in greater detail. The communication device is often a two way communication device having both voice and data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other computer systems. Depending on the functionality provided by the communication device it may be referred to as a data messaging device a two way pager a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities a wireless Internet appliance a smartphone a table computer or a data communication device.

The communication device includes a communication subsystem which includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more embedded or internal antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . As will be apparent to those skilled in field of communications the particular design of the communication subsystem depends on the communication network in which the communication device is intended to operate.

The communication device includes a processor which controls general operation of the communication device . The processor can interact with additional device subsystems such as a display a flash memory a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems such as a keyboard or trackball for example a data port a speaker a microphone a short range communications subsystem such as Bluetooth for example and any other device subsystems or peripheral devices generally designated at .

Operating system software used by the processor may be stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory which may be a ROM a ROM or similar storage element not shown . The operating system specific device applications or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as RAM .

The processor in addition to its operating system functions enables execution of software applications on the communication device . A predetermined set of applications which control basic device operations is installed on the communication device during its manufacture. These basic operations typically include data and voice communication applications for example. Additionally applications may also be loaded onto the communication device through the network an auxiliary I O subsystem serial port short range communications module or any other suitable subsystem and installed by a user in RAM ROM or flash memory for execution by the processor . Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the communication device and may provide enhanced on device features communication related features or both.

The short range communication module provides for communication between the electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the short range communication module may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

The display is used to visually present an application s graphical user interface GUI to the user. The user can manipulate application data by modifying information on the GUI using an auxiliary input output device such as a keyboard for example. Depending on the type of communication device the user may have access to other types of input devices such as for example a scroll wheel trackball light pen or touch sensitive screen.

In some example embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may include an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The electronic device may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network.

In some example embodiments the communication device also includes a removable memory module typically including flash memory and a memory module interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device via the memory module which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory module for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module may be inserted in or connected to the memory module interface of the electronic device .

In some example embodiments the electronic device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the electronic device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer for processing.

The communication device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the electronic device .

A persistent publish and subscribe PPS service allows a process i.e. a publisher to publish data to a file e.g. an object file that can be read by one or more permitted subscribers. The permitted subscribers may be processes or applications operating or running on the same device as the publisher. The publisher may not have to identify the intended recipients or subscribers instead the published data can be broadcast to permitted subscribers through the file. The subscribers can be provided with access to the service in accordance with a set of permissions. Permissions can include the ability to receive certain published content or to communicate data to the publisher or to read from and or write to the file. The PPS service can be associated with specific processes applications or network connection such that only one PPS service operates for a specific process application or network connection. It is understood that PPS services can have additional applications not specifically described. A PPS service can be in operation on a communication device on a server or on one or more devices in communication e.g. over a network . A PPS service can be used on a communication device to allow only permitted processes on the communication device to communicate with one another.

The PPS module can be an application that is running on the communication device . For example a processor on the device can be executing a set of instructions stored on a memory in order operate the PPS module . According to an embodiment the ACL is a file stored on the device e.g. in memory that the PPS module can read from and or write to. In alternative embodiments the ACL may be stored remotely and accessed over or through a communication network . The ACL can be configured to store one or more permissions associated with the subscribers . For example the permissions associated with a subscriber may identify the publisher and or PPS object that the subscriber is permitted to communicate with. By way of further example a subscriber can be considered a permitted subscriber with respect to a PPS object or publisher if that subscriber is permitted to communicate with the publisher through the PPS object .

According to an embodiment the PPS object is an object file that is instantiated by the PPS module on request from a subscriber . The PPS object can be stored at the device or remotely at another location for example. The publisher can send or publish data to the PPS object such that data sent to the PPS object is broadcast or accessible to one or more permitted subscribers . Similarly the publisher can receive data from the PPS object sent by specific permitted subscribers . Such received data can be correspondence from one or more permitted subscriber for example. The transmission of data to and from the PPS object can comprise writing data to and reading data from the PPS object respectively.

In the illustrated embodiment the subscribers are processes or applications operating on the communication device on which a PPS service operates. For example the PPS object can be stored or maintained on the same communication device . Similarly the publisher can be a process or application operating on the same communication device .

The illustrated embodiment shows three subscribers . It is recognized that more or fewer subscribes can use or be implemented in the PPS service . A subscriber subscribes to data stored at or sent to the PPS object by the publisher . For example a subscriber can read data from the PPS object in accordance with permissions provided in the ACL . Similarly a subscriber may be permitted to write data to the PPS object in order to communicate with the publisher in accordance with permissions provided in the ACL . A PPS object can be associated with a particular process or network connection e.g. a protected network connection . In accordance with an embodiment there is one ACL per PPS object . Alternatively there can be one ACL for maintaining permissions with respect to multiple PPS objects . Generally the ACL can be used to define for any topic or PPS object and subscriber the right of that subscriber to receive publications on that topic or to request persistent delivery of a publication on that topic. The ACL can also define the level of protection that can apply to each topic such as for example the identity of subscribers permitted to read data from a particular PPS object .

In an embodiment correspondence from a subscriber through the PPS object comprises a request to establish a connection to a communication network or to connect to a communication network over an existing connection. In a further embodiment there are no other methods for a subscriber to request to connect to a communication network over a particular network connection nor are there other methods for a subscriber to request to establish a particular connection to a communication network . Additionally the PPS object may be associated with a specific network connection or network interface such that all requests to connect communications between processes on the communication device relating to connecting to a communication network over that specific network connection pass through the PPS object . Thus in accordance with such an embodiment only processes or applications that are identified in an ACL with permission to transmit data to a communication network over a specific network connection can communicate with the PPS object .

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment the process is an application or process that is initiated or running or operating on the communication device . A launcher is associated with the requesting process . The launcher is a process that is used to initiate or launch the process . For example the launcher is a process coupled to the process that assists with certain functionality of launching the process . By way of further example the launcher comprises an interface through which the process can be initiated or launched. For example the launcher may comprise a user interface on the communication device through which the process can be launched or initiated. There may be one or more other processes that are initiated or running or operating on the communication device along with or instead of the process and to which the description in applies. For example another process not shown can be associated with the launcher PPS module the PPS object and the network interface module .

According to the illustrated embodiment a PPS service is implemented on the communication device such that the process comprises a subscriber and the CDSC comprises the publisher . The process and the CDSC may each also be in communication with or coupled to the network interface module and the PPS module . The PPS module PPS object and one or more ACL operate as the PPS service between the CDSC and the process . It is understood that there can be more than one process and that each process can be a subscriber to the same PPS object . In accordance with an embodiment the PPS service shown in i.e. the PPS module the PPS object the ACL the process and the CDSC can be associated with a specific network interface or network connection used to transmit data to and from or communicate with a communications network . For example the PPS service on the communication device can be associated exclusively with a protected connection such that the PPS object is the only mechanism that the process can use to communicate with the CDSC in respect of the protected connection. It is recognized that in other embodiments there may be other mechanisms for allowing communication between the CDSC and process and or that there may be multiple PPS objects associated with the protected connection.

Still with reference to the illustrated embodiment in the authorization process module is in communication with the launcher ACL and PPS module . The authorization process module can be configured to receive authorization requests from the process . In accordance with an exemplary embodiment the authorization process module is configured to authorize a process to transmit data to the communication network over a protected connection. An example authorization request can include the identity of the process and the identity of the communication network that the process is requesting to establish a connection to. A further example authorization request can include the identity of the process the identity of a protected connection or network interface that the process is requesting authorization to connect to. The identity of the process can include a process ID for example. It is understood that the process can be an application running on a communication device such that the authorization request is transmitted within the communication device . The identity of the network interface or network connection can include an IP address or a port number for example.

In a further embodiment the authorization module is configured to verify the capabilities of the process . For example when the process is initiated e.g. on the communication device the launcher i.e. a process running in association with the process extracts certain capabilities from the process s manifest and transmits the capabilities to the authorization process module . A process s or application s manifest can be data e.g. metadata associated with the process or application e.g. the process that contains identifying information and or permission information and or session information in respect of the process or application. The authorization process module verifies the capabilities of the process . For example the authorization process module can maintain a list or descriptions of authorized applications or processes and their capabilities that it can then compare to the capabilities of the process as extracted by the launcher . For example the process can request to connect to a communication network over an existing protected connection. If the capabilities are verified then the authorization process module authorizes the process to connect to the communication network through the protected connection. If the capabilities are not verified then the authorization process module declines to authorize the process to connect to the network interface or network connection e.g. the protected connection . In a further example the process can request to establish a protected connection to the communication network . If the capabilities are verified then the authorization process module authorizes the process to establish the protected connection. If the capabilities are not verified then the authorization process module declines to authorize the process to establish the protected connection. The capabilities may provide information that identifies the specific communication networks or network connection that the process is authorized or permitted to connect to or to establish. For example the capabilities can indicate that a certain application or process is authorized to transmit data to a communication network over a specific protected connection. Similarly the capabilities may provide information that identifies the specific communication networks or network connection s that the process is not permitted or is not authorized to establish connections over or to connect to. It is recognized that the authorization process module may authorize the process to establish connections to one or more communication networks while declining to authorize the process to establish connections to one or more other communication networks. Similarly the authorization process module can authorize the process to transmit data to a communication network across a certain protected connection but not to a communication network across another protected connection. Generally the role of the authorization process module is to verify or authorize that a process is permitted to establish or to access a protected connection and the role of the launcher is to provide the authorization process module with identifying information regarding the process .

In accordance with the embodiment illustrated in the authorization process module is in communication with the ACL . For example the authorization process module can transmit data e.g. write data to the ACL and can receive data e.g. read data from the ACL . In accordance with an exemplary embodiment the ACL maintains a set of permissions for establishing connections to communication networks or for transmitting data across existing connections to communication networks . For example the ACL can be a file that stores a list of applications or processes and a list of communication networks and or existing connections e.g. protected connections that each listed application or process is permitted to transmit data to. In an embodiment the ACL maintains or stores the identities of the processes or applications that are permitted to request to establish a connection to specific communication networks and the identities of the processes or applications that are permitted to connect to specific protected connections. For example the ACL can maintain or store a white list of applications or processes that are permitted to transmit data across a specific protected connection e.g. the protected connection associated with the PPS object for example . In yet another embodiment the ACL maintains or stores permissions for one or more applications or process indicating which network connections that each application or process is permitted to transmit data across. The authorization process module can amend add to or remove one or more permissions maintained at the ACL . For example the authorization process module can edit the data stored on the ACL such that the process is noted as having permission to request to connect to the communication network across the protected connection associated with the PPS object . For example the authorization process module can add the identity or permission s of a process to an ACL after the authorization process module has verified the capabilities of the process as provided for example by the launcher . According to an exemplary embodiment the permissions to connect to a communication network across a protected connection or network interface that are maintained by the ACL comprise permissions to read from and or write to the PPS object associated with the specific network interface or network connection.

Still with reference to the embodiment illustrated in the CDSC is a process or an application running on the communication device . The CDSC configures and manages connections to communication network s e.g. a wireless network on the communication device . By way of example the CDSC can provide a communication path to a process through which the process can request to connect to a specific communication network across a specific network connection or network interface. Similarly the CDSC can provide a communication path to a process through which the process can request to establish a connection to a communication network . According to the illustrated embodiment the CDSC is in communication with the PPS object the PPS module the packet filter module and the network interface module . More specifically the CDSC can transmit data to or receive data from each of the identified modules. For example the CDSC communicates with the process s through the PPS object using the PPS service such that the CDSC is the publisher in the PPS service . It is recognized that other methods of communication between processes applications or modules can be used in alternative embodiments. In another example the CDSC can configure the process to connect to a communication network through a network connection on the communication device . For example the CDSC can populate a packet data protocol context with information and data from the process and transmit the packet data protocol context to the network interface module where the of the connection may be completed or configured. Further the CDSC can request or instruct that the packet filter module apply one or more pre determined rules to restrict data transfer across a specified network interface or network connection e.g. the protected connection . Such a request or instruction may be automatically transmitted or communicated to the packet filter module after the CDSC receives confirmation that a network connection e.g. the protected connection is open for example.

The network interface module configures the network interfaces and drivers for the transport technology that is used by a process e.g. Wi Fi network cellular networks and wired networks . The network interface module may also manage communications and data transmission through network connections and or network interfaces. For example the network interface module may receive requests or calls from the CDSC to activate a packet data protocol PDP context from a specific process to establish a specific network connection over which data can be transmitted. The network interface module can then activate the PDP context in accordance with the general packet radio service GPRS or other network protocol for example thereby opening a data tunnel over which data can be transmitted. In one or more embodiments one PDP context can be activated for allowing multiple processes or applications to transmit data to a communication network across a connection. The network interface module can comprise a radio transmitter on the communication device .

In an exemplary embodiment a PDP context is used to facilitate the transmission of data from one or more processes over a protected connection. It is understood that the PDP context can be used to facilitate the transmission of data from processes over other network connections. The communication network may be a GPRS. To be connected to the GPRS a subscriber e.g. a communication device or an application must first be allocated an activated PDP context. The PDP context is a data structure which can be maintained at the network interface module and which contains the subscriber s session information. The PDP context can contain each subscriber s session information. The session information can include the subscriber s identification e.g. International Mobile Subscriber Identity or process ID . In some embodiments the session information may comprise the access point for the identified network connection and the access point may identify the GPRS network. After a PDP context is activated the network connection e.g. protected connection is open and able to receive connections. In an embodiment the PDP context is populated at or by the CDSC however it is understood that the PDP context can be populated at or by the network interface module .

Still with reference to the packet filter module manages the filtering of data packets transmitted to the communication network through the network interface associated with the protected connection. It is understood that the network interface is associated with the protected connection which in turn is associated with the PPS object . For example all data passing from the commination device over the protected connection passes through the network interface. The packet filter module may be in communication with the CDSC for receiving instructions indicating the type manner and or magnitude of packet filters to apply to data passing over through or to the network interface. For example the packet filter module may comprise or be configured to apply a set of pre determined rules such as packet filter rules to all data transferred over the network interface and or over a particular network connection. One or more packet filter rules can be applied over the network interface in order to filter packets transmitted to or through the network interface. For example a blocking rule such as a block all packet filter rule prevents all packets from traveling over the network interface and an allow packet filter rule allows packets from one or more identified sources e.g. IP addresses process ID numbers to pass through the network interface. The block all and allow packet filter rules can be used together so that data packets coming from all sources except for those identified in the allow packet filter rule are blocked or prevented from passing through the network interface to the communication network . In accordance with an embodiment the CDSC instructs the packet filter module of the identity of the applications or processes to be added to the allow packet filter rule so that data transmitted from such identified applications or processes to the network interface is not blocked by the block all rule.

In accordance with one or more embodiments the PPS service is used to manage communications between process and the CDSC . For example the PPS module manages all communication between process and the CDSC in respect of the protected connection. The PPS module can instantiate a single PPS object for a specific network interface or network connection so that all communication between the process and the CDSC with respect to the specific network interface are communicated through the PPS object . According to an embodiment the PPS object is associated with a protected connection. According to an embodiment a process transmits information to the CDSC by writing to the PPS object and the CDSC receives such correspondence by reading from the PPS object . Similarly the CDSC corresponds with a process by writing to the PPS object and the process receives correspondence by reading from the PPS object . As noted above the CDSC may be considered the publisher under the PPS service so that it need not identify the recipients of correspondence or information or data that it writes to the PPS object . Similarly the process may be considered a subscriber so that it will only receive information data or communication that it subscribes to. Information data or communications that a process subscribes to can be limited to a specific network connection or network interface for example.

According to an embodiment the ACL is associated with each PPS object in order to control manage and restrict access to the PPS object to specifically identified applications or subscribers . For example the ACL may have a list of processes or applications e.g. identified by IP address or process identification number etc. that have permission to write to and or read from a specific PPS object associated with a specified network interface or network connection. By way of further example there may be an ACL associated with the PPS object which in turn is associated with a protected connection. The CDSC and or the authorization process module may have the ability to edit the ACL in order to provide permission for identified applications to read from and write to one or more PPS objects .

With reference to a sequence of communications that can be used on a communication device to connect to a network interface or communication network will now be described. According to the sequence of communications identified at numeral there is control over the identity of the applications or processes that can connect to the communication network but there may be no control over the data that passes through the network interface from such applications or processes.

At the launcher retrieves the capabilities of the requesting process from the manifest e.g. metadata of the requesting process . It is understood that the requesting process is an example or embodiment of the process described with reference to . At the launcher checks the retrieved capabilities with the authorization process module . For example the launcher can transmit the requesting process s capabilities to the authorization process module and in response the authorization process module can verify whether the requesting process has the capabilities that permit it to connect to a network connection e.g. a protected connection . The authorization process module may perform this step by using a set of pre determined rules for verifying selected capabilities from a requesting process .

At the authorization process module updates the ACL to ensure that the requesting process is noted or identified as permitted or authorized to correspond with the CDSC using the PPS service for certain network connections which may be determined or identified in the capabilities of the requesting process. For example the authorization process module can edit the ACL to ensure that the requesting process is noted as permitted to connect a communication network through one or more network connections. The permitted network connections can be part of the requesting process s manifest or capabilities for example. Alternatively the ACL may only indicate that the requesting process is permitted to connect to any network connection that it requests a connection to on the communication device . It is understood that there may be other methods for maintaining a record or storing the identities of applications or processes that are permitted to access certain network connections.

At the requesting process attempts to open communication with the CDSC . For example the requesting process can request from the PPS service e.g. the PPS module that a PPS object be opened in respect of a specified network connection e.g. a protected connection . For example the request to open the PPS object could comprise an identification of the requesting process e.g. the process ID and the identification of the network connection or network interface e.g. port number or IP address . At the PPS service e.g. the PPS module transmits the open PPS object request to the CDSC . The CDSC can then verify with the ACL whether the requesting process is permitted or authorized to connect to the identified network connection. Alternatively verifying or confirming with the ACL whether the requesting process can access or connect to a specific network connection is performed by the PPS module checking the ACL rather than by the CDSC checking with the ACL .

If permission for the requesting process to connect to the identified network connection e.g. a protected connection is verified i.e. the requesting process has permission the CDSC instructs the PPS module to open or instantiate a PPS object if one is not already open or instantiated and to grant read and or write access for the PPS object to the requesting process at . If permission is not verified then read and write access for the PPS object is not granted to the requesting process and the requesting process will therefore not be permitted to request form the CDSC that it connect to the network connection. It is understood that the ACL and or the PPS module and or the CDSC may indicate whether the requesting process is authorized or has permission to only read from or only write to the PPS Object .

At the PPS service e.g. the PPS module can open or instantiate the PPS object if one is not already opened or instantiated and notify the requesting process of this fact. The requesting process may then be in a position to request that the CDSC connect it to the associated network connection e.g. the network connection associated with the PPS service .

At the requesting process transmits a connection request e.g. by making a connection call to the CDSC through the PPS service . For example the requesting process can write a message to the PPS object requesting that the CDSC open a connection to a specific network connection for the requesting process to transmit data through. The connection request from the requesting process can be for connecting to a specific network connection e.g. a protected connection . It is recognized that other methods or protocols for initiating a connection from a specific application can be performed. Alternatively for example the PPS service is not used and another method of communicating a connection request from the requesting process to the CDSC can be performed.

At in response to receiving the connection request e.g. through the PPS service the CDSC requests that the network interface module activate a PDP context for the identified network connection. For example the network interface module may configure the PDP context for the requesting process and the associated network connection. The request communicated from the CDSC to the network interface module can comprise the identity of the requesting process along with certain other information in respect of the requesting process in order to allow the network interface module to populate the PDP context with session information for the requesting process . The network interface module then activates the PDP context thereby opening the connection over the network connection or network interface. It is recognized that other methods or protocols for opening connections may be used. The network interface module can comprise a radio transmitter in order to facilitate data transfer from a network connection e.g. a protected connection to a communication network .

At the network interface module communicates to the CDSC that the connection to the requested network connection e.g. the protected connection is open i.e. that the PDP context is activated . At the CDSC communicates to the PPS service e.g. by writing to the PPS object that the connection is open and at the requesting process receives information from the PPS service e.g. by reading from the PPS object notifying of the open connection. It is recognized that there are alternative methods of communicating to the requesting process that a network connection is open at a network interface. The CDSC may also communicate to the PPS service other status information in respect of the open network connection including that the blocking rule and allow rule have been applied.

At the requesting process establishes a connection to a socket on the network interface in association with the network interface module for example . It is understood that a bind operation may have been previously performed on the socket by the network interface module and or a process operating at or in association with the network interface. It is also understood that other actions to connect the requesting process to the network interface in order to transmit data from the requesting process to the network may be undertaken at this stage.

At the requesting process sends or transmits data across the open connection to the communication network . It is understood that the requesting process can also receive data from the communication network across the network interface.

It is understood that the network connection discussed in respect of can be a single protected connection and that the network interface discussed in respect of can be associated with the protected connection.

With reference to a sequence of communications that can be used in accordance with an exemplary embodiment will now be described. The sequence of communications identified at numeral is such that control is maintained over the identity of the applications or processes on a communication device that can establish a connection e.g. a protected connection to a communication network e.g. a wireless network and that control is maintained over the identity of applications or processes that can transmit data across the protected connection or network interfaces associated with the protected connection.

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment the stages describes at numerals to are performed as described in the sequence of communications illustrated in .

At which can be performed after the PDP context is activated at in the CDSC instructs the packet filter module apply a block all rule to all data passing through an identified network interface. It is understood that an alternative blocking rule could be applied that only prevents all data from being transferred from the requesting process to the communication network through the identified network interface and not vice versa. In an embodiment the packet filter module applies the block all rule over the network interface in response to the instructions received from the CDSC . It is understood that the packet filter module can be in communication with in association with or be coupled to the network interface module in order to configure the block all rule.

At the CDSC instructs the packet filter module to apply the allow rule to all data passing through the network interface. In an embodiment the packet filter module applies the allow rule to all data passing across the network interface in response to the instructions received from the CDSC . The allow rule identifies the requesting process e.g. by process ID such that data packets transmitted from the identified requesting process will be permitted pass through the network interface unobstructed. The combination of the block all and allow rules results in a network interface through which all transmitted data is blocked except for data that is explicitly allowed to pass through in accordance with the allow rule. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment all data that is transmitted from a requesting process or other source identified in the allow rule will pass through the network interface despite the application of the block all rule. The use of the allow rule with the bock all rule comprises an example of selective restriction or management of the data that can be communicated over a network connection or network interface.

It is understood that before applying the blocking and allow rules and the packet filter module may first install packet filter rules at the network interface with the packet filter rules comprising both a blocking filter e.g. the block all rule and an allow filter rule e.g. the allow rule .

The stages described at and can be performed as described in the sequence of communications illustrated in and may be performed after the block all rule and allow rule are applied .

In accordance with the illustrated embodiment the stages describes at numerals to are performed as described in the sequence of communications illustrated in . It is understood that in one or more embodiments updating the ACL may not include amending the ACL to list to identity of the second process . Instead updating the ACL may only include verifying that the second process is listed or identified in the ACL. Following the connection call the CDSC instructs the packet filter module to updated the allow rule to include the identification of the second process in the list of processes or applications that are permitted to transmit data across the network interface associated with the protected connection.

After the allow rule is updated the stages identified by numerals and as illustrated and described with reference to are performed.

As a result of the continued application of the block all rule and the application of the updated allow rule data from the requesting process and from the second process is permitted to be transmitted across the network interface of the protected connection whereas data from any other application or process will be blocked by the block all rule. This use of the allow rule with the bock all rule comprises an example of selective restriction or management of the data that can be communicated over a network connection or network interface.

At a determination is made as to whether the requesting process on the communication device is authorized to connect to the communication network over a protected connection. The authorization may be based on capabilities of the requesting process on the type of protected connection or on other pre determined criteria. In an exemplary embodiment the connection between the requesting process and the communication network through the protected connection is first initiated or established. For example the capabilities of the requesting process may first be verified and the requesting process may then be configured to request to establish the protected connection.

At a network interface on the communication device is configured to allow data packets to be transmitted from the requesting process to the communication network over the protected connection.
