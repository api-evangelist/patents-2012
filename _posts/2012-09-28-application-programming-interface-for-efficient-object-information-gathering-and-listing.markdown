title: Application programming interface for efficient object information gathering and listing
abstract: An information system has a database having distinct object structures that store information about corresponding operating components of the system. An association structure describes many-to-many relationships among the components. Targeted requests for information about first objects are satisfied by obtaining information from a first object structure as well as information about associated objects from the second object structure. Bulk requests for information about a large number of objects are handled differently, using a lookup structure that associates the first objects with limited information of the associated second objects, such as externally visible names which would be meaningful to a requestor. Thus response can efficiently provide full information about all first objects as well as limited but useful information about all associated second objects, avoiding traversals of the association structure and corresponding interrogations of the second object structure.

This application relates to techniques for gathering and listing information about managed objects such as storage objects.

Computer systems may include different resources used by one or more host processors. Resources and host processors in a computer system may be interconnected by one or more communication connections. These resources may include for example data storage devices such as those included in the data storage systems manufactured by EMC Corporation. These data storage systems may be coupled to one or more servers or host processors and provide storage services to each host processor. Multiple data storage systems from one or more different vendors may be connected and may provide common data storage for one or more host processors in a computer system.

A host processor may perform a variety of data processing tasks and operations using the data storage system. For example a host processor may perform basic system I O operations in connection with data requests such as data read and write operations.

Host processor systems may store and retrieve data using a storage device containing a plurality of host interface units disk drives and disk interface units. The host systems access the storage device through a plurality of channels provided therewith. Host systems provide data and access control information through the channels to the storage device and the storage device provides data to the host systems also through the channels. The host systems do not address the disk drives of the storage device directly but rather access what appears to the host systems as a plurality of logical disk units. The logical disk units may or may not correspond to the actual disk drives. Allowing multiple host systems to access the single storage device unit allows the host systems to share data in the device. In order to facilitate sharing of the data on the device additional software on the data storage systems may also be used.

In connection with data storage systems or more generally any type of system data may be provided to a user or client in response to a client request. The client request may be a request to obtain information or perform an operation. The client may issue requests to multiple providers each having its own published API application programming interface which the client uses when issuing requests. The client may therefore have to utilize a variety of different and possibly disparate interfaces for desired requests.

In accordance with the present invention a method of operating an information system such as a storage system is disclosed. The information system uses a database having object structures that store information about corresponding operating components of the system. In the case of a storage system these operating components may be logical units of storage LUNs snapshots in time SNAPs of the contents of the LUNs or other components. For each operating component the information in a corresponding object includes an externally visible component identifier e.g. a LUN name in the form of a world wide name or WWN as well as other information. The system further includes provider components that provide access to the object structures and a business logic component that invokes the provider components to obtain information from the object structures to satisfy client requests for information. The provider components generally do not communicate between themselves rather they each communicate with the business logic component. The system also maintains one or more specialized lookup structures for example a lookup structure that includes for each of a first type of operating component first operating component the externally visible component identifier for each one of a number of second types of operating components second operating components with which the first operating component is associated.

In response to a targeted request from a client for information about one of the first operating components a first application programming interface API of the business logic component is invoked. The first API retrieves the information by 1 obtaining the information of the first operating component from a first object structure via a first provider component 2 traversing the association structure to identify each second operating component with which the first operating component is associated and 3 obtaining the information of each of the identified second operating components via a second provider component. The obtained information of the first operating component and of each identified second operating component is returned to the client in satisfaction of the request.

In response to a bulk request from the client for information about all of the first operating components the first API is invoked to obtain the information of each of the first operating components from the first object structure via the first provider component and a second API of the first provider component is invoked to obtain via the lookup structure the externally visible component identifier of each second operating component with which each of the first operating components is associated. The obtained information of the first operating component and the obtained second component identifiers being returned to the client in satisfaction of the request.

By the above technique the response to a bulk request can include extensive information about the objects of the request first operating component along with some limited information such as externally visible component identifier about their associated objects second operating components . Further this additional limited information is provided efficiently using the lookup structure rather than requiring a number of traversals of the association structure and requests to the second provider to obtain the information from the second objects. Thus the technique provides for efficient handling of requests for object information even in systems having a large number of objects in many to many relationships such as a collection of LUN and SNAP objects in a storage system.

In such an embodiment in which element of is implemented using one or more data storage systems each of the data storage systems and management system may include code thereon for performing the techniques as described herein.

Servers or host systems such as provide data and access control information through channels to the storage systems and the storage systems may also provide data to the host systems also through the channels. The host systems may not address the disk drives of the storage systems directly but rather access to data may be provided to one or more host systems from what the host systems view as a plurality of logical devices or logical volumes LVs . The LVs may or may not correspond to the actual disk drives. For example one or more LVs may reside on a single physical disk drive. Data in a single storage system may be accessed by multiple hosts allowing the hosts to share the data residing therein. An LV or LUN logical unit number may be used to refer to the foregoing logically defined devices or volumes.

For purposes of illustration the techniques herein will be described with respect to a single unitary data storage system such as single data storage array including two service processors or compute processing units. Techniques herein may be more generally use in connection with any one or more data storage system each including a different number of service processors than as illustrated herein. The data storage system may be a data storage array such as a CLARiiON data storage array by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton Mass. including a plurality of data storage devices and two service or storage processors . The service processors may be computer processing units included in the data storage system for processing requests and commands. In connection with performing techniques herein an embodiment of the data storage system may include multiple service processors including more than two service processors as described.

Additionally the two service processors may be used in connection with failover processing when communicating with the management system . Client software on the management system may be used in connection with performing data storage system management by issuing commands to the data storage system and or receiving responses from the data storage system over connection . In one embodiment the management system may be a laptop or desktop computer system.

The particular data storage system as described in this embodiment or a particular device thereof such as a disk should not be construed as a limitation. Other types of commercially available data storage systems as well as processors and hardware controlling access to these particular devices may also be included in an embodiment.

Referring to shown is an example of an embodiment of the data storage system that may be included in the system of . Included in the data storage system of are one or more data storage systems as may be manufactured by one or more different vendors. Each of the data storage systems may be a data storage array inter connected not shown to other data storage array s . Additionally as noted above the data storage systems may also be connected to the host systems through any one or more communication connections . In this example as described in more detail in following paragraphs reference is made to the more detailed view of element . It should be noted that a similar more detailed description may also apply to any one or more of the other elements such as but have been omitted for simplicity of explanation.

Each of the data storage systems such as may include a plurality of storage devices such as disk devices or volumes included in an arrangement consisting of n rows of disks or more generally data storage devices . In this arrangement each row of disks may be connected to a disk adapter DA or director responsible for the backend management of operations to and from a portion of the disks . In the system a single DA such as may be responsible for the management of a row of disks such as row . In a data storage system such as by EMC Corporation a backend DA may also be referred to as a disk controller. The DA may performed operations such as reading data from and writing data to the physical devices which are serviced by the DA.

The system may also include one or more storage processors . Each of the storage processors may be CPU and an embodiment may include any number of such processors. For example the CLARiiON data storage system by EMC Corporation includes two storage processors. The system may also include one or more host adapters HAs or directors . Each of the HAs may be used to manage communications and data operations between one or more host systems and the global memory. In an embodiment the HA may be a Fibre Channel Adapter FA or other adapter which facilitates host communication. The HA communicates with a component of the host such as a host bus adapter HBA . Generally directors may also be characterized as the different adapters such as HAs including FAs DAs RAs and the like as described herein. Components of the data storage system such as an HA which may communicate with a host may also be referred to as front end components. Within the data storage system components which may be characterized as backend components communicate with a front end component. An example of a backend component is a DA. In connection with data storage systems such as by EMC Corporation various types of directors or adapters may be implemented as a processor or more generally a component that includes the processor. Examples of directors are disk adapters DAs host adapters HAs and the like.

One or more internal logical communication paths may exist between the DAs the RAs the HAs and the memory . An embodiment for example may use one or more internal busses and or communication modules. For example the global memory portion may be used to facilitate data transfers and other communications between the DAs HAs and RAs in a data storage system. In one embodiment the DAs may perform data operations using a cache that may be included in the global memory for example in communications with other disk adapters or directors and other components of the system . The other portion is that portion of memory that may be used in connection with other designations that may vary in accordance with each embodiment.

Also shown in the storage system is an RA or remote adapter . The RA may be hardware including a processor used to facilitate communication between data storage systems such as between two of the same or different types of data storage systems.

Referring to shown is a block diagram of components that may be included in a data storage system . In the example there are two service processors also referred to as service processors A and B although a data storage system and techniques herein may be used in an embodiment in which the data storage system includes more than two service processors as mentioned above. Service processor includes software components or modules executing thereon. Service processor includes software components or modules executing thereon. Service processor and may communicate using which is described in more detail below. Element may represent a single logical communication connection used for data storage system management transmissions between the data storage system and one or more external clients. The software components or modules and may be software modules included in data storage system management software residing and executing on the data storage system including software used in connection with communicating with external clients over network connection .

The two service processors may control the operation of the data storage system. The processors may be configured to process requests as may be received from the hosts other data storage systems management system and other components connected thereto. Each of the processors may process received requests and operate independently and concurrently with respect to the other processor. In the example each processor is illustrated as having one or more software modules e.g. web server drivers other modules etc. executing thereon. An embodiment may have a same set of one or more software modules executing on each processor so that either of the processors may service a received request. The example may illustrate the state of the data storage system with software modules that are loaded as a result of booting the data storage system. In the example the processors and have successfully completed the boot process leaving both and in what may be characterized as a healthy state with respect to data storage system management functionality. A service processor may be characterized as being in the healthy state if the service processor has the ability to service normal data storage system management messaging traffic over a communication connection such as a network connection used for data storage management. In other words a processor may be characterized as healthy if it is determined that the processor is able to perform necessary processing and communications in connection with handling typical data storage system management transmissions over a connection used for normal data storage management messaging traffic. A processor may otherwise be characterized as being in an unhealthy state if any deficiency is determined with respect to the foregoing such as a hardware and or software problem so that the processor is unable to be used in connection with handling data storage system management transmissions. Once booted a processor may transition between the states of healthy and unhealthy in accordance with problems that may occur and or be corrected over time.

With respect to data storage management requests operations and the like as may be received from a client such as the management system of in connection with the techniques herein the client may interact with a designated one of the two processors over the communication connection . The designated one of the processors may be characterized as the master with the other processor designated as the slave. In connection with one embodiment in accordance with techniques herein the data storage system may operate in accordance with a master slave or active passive model when communicating with the management system . In accordance with the master slave model only one of the processors and only one instance of the software modules executing thereon may be designated as a master with the other processor and associated software modules thereon designated as the slave . It should be noted that as used herein the terms active and master may be used interchangeably to refer to the designated active or master processor in the master slave or active passive model. Similarly the terms slave or passive may be used interchangeably to refer to the one or more processors other than the active or master processor in accordance with the master slave or active passive model.

In the example instances of the software components executing respectively on processors may communicate over connection . The connection may be a bus or other communication connection to facilitate inter processor communication between the drivers. The connection may be characterized as internal to the data storage system or local with respect to residing on the data storage system and used for communicating between components on the data storage system. The connection may also be referred to as the common management interconnection CMI and may be characterized as part of an internal network over which inter processor communications may occur. Thus one of the service processors may use connection to communication with the other service processor. As will be described in more detail in following paragraphs each service processor may include code which facilitates communication with the other service processor using the connection for inter service processor communication. In particular code of a first service processor may use connection to obtain information collected from another service processor for use in connection with the first service processor providing a consolidated view of the data storage system such as when providing such information in response to a data storage system management request from the management system .

The processors may also communicate over another connection . The connection may represent a TCP IP or other network connection over which instances of the software components on processors respectively may communicate with other externally networked components. Connection may correspond to a single logical connection used for example to communicate with a client such as the management system running a web browser displaying a GUI graphical user interface . The connection may be characterized as a single communication connection between the data storage system and the management system over which the user on the management system may interact with the data storage system in performing data storage system management tasks. The processors may send and or receive transmissions over connection from the management system of . In one embodiment the connection may be part of a dedicated LAN connection for management operations. Host I O requests may be received at the data storage system on different incoming ports such as for example Fibre channel or iSCSI ports not illustrated.

Only one of the processors is designated as active or the master at any time. Thus at any point in time at most one of the SPs communicates with a client in connection with handling data storage system management transmissions over the single connection . In the event that an active master processor transitions from a healthy to an unhealthy state the passive slave processor assumes the role of master if it is in a healthy state. In connection with techniques herein when failover processing results in a processor assuming the role of master the software components thereon may also be designated as the instance of the software modules which are active and communicate with the client. As described herein a processor may be characterized as having an unhealthy state if the processor and or software components executing thereon are not able to communicate with and or process requests from an external client such as the management system over a network. Detection of the state of a processor and or software components executing thereon as healthy or unhealthy may be performed using a variety of different techniques such as for example by the processor itself and or its peer processor. Such techniques may include for example periodically having each processor test communications with the other processor over connections determining a status regarding the software modules on a service processor and its ability to communicate over the external communication connection used for data storage system management transmissions receiving a notification regarding status of a peer processor and the like.

The connection may have a single network address such as an IP address over which the active processor and code executing thereon may communicate with the management system in connection with performing the techniques herein. The software components may represent software components or modules as described herein in more detail on each of the processors. It should be noted that the data storage system of the example includes other components such as storage devices which are omitted from the example for simplicity in illustrating the dual processors .

In connection with techniques herein the management system may issue a request to the data storage system such as illustrated in . The request may be to provide a logical system configuration view regarding components of the data storage system the state of such components and the like. In connection with providing such a view information may be gathered from each of the service processors A and B of . Each service processor may be configured to view a same set of components of the data storage system. For example each service processor may view all storage devices and groups of storage devices of the storage system. Additionally each service processor may also provide information regarding components viewed visible locally or only by that service processor. For example each service processor may provide a view of information regarding components used only by the service processor such as fans and power supplies used only by each service processor. To provide a complete consistent and consolidated view of the data storage system configuration from both service processors processing may be performed by a service processor to aggregate information locally by the service processor along with information collected from the other service processor. For example service processor A may be the master and perform such processing by collecting a local view of configuration information as viewed by service processor A and also requesting and obtaining configuration information as viewed by service processor B. Service processor A may perform processing to combine both its local view and the view in connection with the configuration information collected from service processor B. To perform such collection the service processors may communicate using connection described above and then perform consolidation processing to combine the collected data into a single consolidated view of the data storage system configuration.

The techniques herein may also be used in an embodiment as described above based on the active passive or master slave SP model. However an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein may utilize other SP models in connection with providing the consolidated view. For example as a variation to the foregoing an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein may implement an active active model in connection with providing a consolidated view of data storage configuration information. In the active active model with the multiple SPs of a data storage system a request from a client for the data storage configuration information may be provided by any of the SPs at any time thereby having any SP provide the consolidated view in accordance with techniques herein at any time depending on which SP services a client s request. As a further variation in an embodiment which has more than 2 SPs an embodiment may designate a portion of the SPs as active in connection with servicing a client request at any time where the portion may be less than all of the SPs but more than a single SP. In such embodiments in a data storage system having multiple SPs each SP of the data storage system may collect and consolidate configuration from every other SP and perform techniques described herein to provide a consolidated view of the data storage system across the multiple SPs.

What will be described in following paragraphs are techniques that may be used in connection with software components to gather data from multiple nodes in accordance with a first data model and then perform processing to map or translate the collected data in the first data model to a second different data model. The second data model may place the data in accordance with a format and structure consumable or usable by a client such as a user interface that displays the resulting data of the second data model to a user. The first data model may for example utilize data in a form as reported by drivers or other lower level components. The second data model may also be referred to as a client data model. In connection with techniques herein the second data model may be a virtual table or view constructed dynamically or on the fly in response to a client request. In processing or mapping data from the first data model to the second data model an intermediate layer and also intermediate object model may be utilized. The objects of the first data model and intermediate object model may be object based models using database tables. The objects of the client data model may be included in virtual tables or views such as constructed using database queries.

As mentioned above the techniques herein may be used with an object based model using database tables and virtual tables. In particular both the first and second data model as well as the intermediate object model may be different object based models using different set of tables. In such an embodiment using an object based model a row in a table e.g. where the table may be a virtual or database table may correspond to an object instance and each column in the table may correspond to an attribute or property of the object. The object may correspond to and represent the state of a physical or logical entity in the data storage system. For example depending on the model an object may represent a physical component such as a fan power supply port logical storage device or physical storage device. The physical and or logical component may be characterized by state information represented as properties or attributes of an object. For example an object corresponding to a physical storage device may have attributes representing the total available storage capacity an amount of unused or free storage capacity physical device characteristics and the like. An object may also represent a logical entity such as a RAID group LUN or LV storage group of one or more LUNs and the like. A logical entity such as a RAID group may be represented by an object having attributes such as indicating a RAID level of the RAID group e.g. RAID 0 1 5 or 6 a number of data and or parity drives and the like.

Referring to shown is an example of software components that may be included in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The example includes components of the data storage system and an external client . As described in more detail below the components included on the data storage system may be used in connection with mapping data of first data model to a second data model. The dashed line denoted as A may represent a partitioning of components included in the data storage system e.g. those below the dashed line A and those which are external to the data storage system e.g. those above the dashed line A . The example includes a remote or external client and components below dashed line A representing those components of one of the service processors such as SP A of the data storage system. It should be noted that although an instance of the components of are illustrated with respect to only a single service processor A each other service processor of the data storage system such as service processor B may also include an instance of the components of . Element includes the following software components provider manager services subset business logic provider LUN provider one or more other providers data store database platform abstraction layer PAL admin administrative software layer and driver s .

Element may represent a subset of providers that may be used in connection with providing information for use in connection with responding to a client request for information. In this example element may include a provider services subset manager a snapshot provider and one or more other providers included in the subset partitioning of . Element may represent a designated portion of such provider services as may be functionally included for example in a DLL dynamic link library or other functional framework. In one embodiment element may represent providers of newly developed code and data models in contrast to for example older legacy code modules and data models as may be used by the providers and .

The snapshot provider may provide information in connection with snapshots of LUNs. As known in the art a snapshot may be characterized as a point in time logical image of data. In connection with LUNs software of a data storage system may provide one or more data replication services or facilities whereby a snapshot is one such facility. The SnapView application is an application provided by EMC Corporation which may be used to create point in time snapshot of production data for nondisruptive backup. A snapshot may be made with respect to a source LUN thereby providing a point in time image of the source LUN. A snapshot may appear like a normal LUN and may be used for backup testing and the like. Snapshots may rely for example on copy on first write COFW and other techniques to track source LUN changes from the time when a snapshot was created. Any writes to the source LUN may result in processing by snapshot software to copy the original data prior to changes into another area of storage. With respect to COFW techniques the COFW occurs only once for each data block modified on the source LUN. Since only changed data blocks of the source LUN are retained rather than make a complete copy of the source LUN the storage capacity required to implement snapshots may be considerably less than that of the source LUN. A snapshot of a LUN is a virtual point in time copy and requires access to the unchanged data in the source LUN. Therefore failures affecting the source LUN also affect the snapshot of the LUN. Snapshots of a LUN may be contrasted for example with clones or bit for bit replica data copies of a source LUN. Information regarding clones in connection with servicing client requests may be provided by another provider such as a clone provider included as one of the other providers or . The snapshot provider may receive as an input an identifier uniquely identifying a particular snapshot. The unique snapshot identifier may identify an object instance including properties of the particular snapshot. In response the snapshot provider may provide return all properties of the particular snapshot identified by the received unique snapshot identifier.

The LUN provider may provide information about requested LUNs. For example the LUN provider may receive as an input an identifier uniquely identifying a particular LUN. The unique LUN identifier may identify an object instance including properties of the particular LUN. In response the LUN provider may provide return all properties of the particular LUN identified by the received unique LUN identifier. More generally the LUN provider may also be referred to as a storage device provider.

As described in more detail in following paragraphs the business logic provider may perform processing in accordance defined business logic. With reference to data storage management an operation or task of the business logic provider may include retrieving different sets of information of a current data storage configuration for display and presentation to a user e.g. client via a data storage management GUI graphical user interface . The user may issue a request for particular data storage management information through the GUI for example by selecting a menu item or other interface element. In response code of the GUI may issue a request to the data storage system modules to perform an operation and obtain the requested information. In connection with obtaining the desired information in accordance with the client request the business logic provider may facilitate and coordinate communications with one or more different providers to obtain the desired information. A client such as external or remote client may request to receive a consolidated logical view of components of the data storage system and may communicate with one of the storage processors A B currently designated as the master. For example assume processor A is the master processor. The client request may be received by the provider manager which then forwards the client request to the appropriate provider. For example the provider manager may receive a request from the client to obtain information regarding a particular snapshot. The client request may include a unique snapshot identifier as described elsewhere herein. In particular the client may request to obtain LUN information corresponding to the source LUN of the snapshot having the unique snapshot identifier. Thus to be returned to the client may be a LUN object in terms of the client data model including all properties or attributes of the source LUN of the snapshot having the snapshot identifier included in the client requested . The provider manager may forward this particular request for information on the requested snapshot having the unique snapshot identifier to the business logic provider . The business logic provider may then communicate with one or more other providers to obtain the requested information for the source LUN object for the unique snapshot identifier of the client request. As a first step the business logic provider may request a list of properties of the snapshot object having the unique snapshot identifier included in the client request. The business logic provider may communicate with the provider services subset manager which then forwards the request to one of the providers within . In this example the provider services subset manager forwards the request to the snapshot provider whereby the snapshot provider may return the properties of the snapshot object to and then to e.g. returning up the call chain . In one embodiment one of the properties of the snapshot object returned by the snapshot provider may identify the source LUN. In particular as described in more detail in following paragraphs the snapshot object returned by the snapshot provider may include a LUN identifier property whereby the LUN identifier may map to or be a pointer to a LUN object corresponding to the source LUN for the snapshot. The LUN identifier may be for example a foreign key of a database table of LUN objects whereby the foreign key serves as a primary key or index uniquely identifying LUN instances in another table database or other construct used by the LUN provider . Each LUN may have a row in the database table used by the LUN provider whereby each row corresponds to a different LUN and its associated LUN object and the row for a LUN may be uniquely identified or mapped to the LUN s identifier. If a LUN serves as a source LUN for a particular snapshot the LUN s foregoing LUN identifier is included as a property of the particular snapshot s snapshot object as returned by the snapshot provider .

Once the business logic provider receives the properties for the snapshot object from the snapshot provider the business logic provider may then extract the property of interest for the source LUN identifier and issue another request to the LUN provider passing as an input the source LUN identifier. The LUN provider may return the properties of the LUN object for the source LUN identifier. The business logic provider may return to the client the LUN object properties for the source LUN identifier corresponding to the snapshot identifier of the original client request.

The foregoing is one manner and example of how the business logic provider may be used to facilitate communications between different providers to obtain requested client information. In accordance with techniques herein associations or relationships may exist between different objects of different providers such as between the snapshot object and the LUN object described above whereby the LUN object corresponds to that of the source LUN for the snapshot. More generally such associations or relationships may exist between a first object of a first provider and second object of a different provider. In accordance with techniques herein such an association or relationship may be represented using a property of the first object e.g. snapshot object whereby the property has a value identifying the second object e.g. source LUN object . When the snapshot provider constructs the snapshot object such as may be performed dynamically in response to a client request the snapshot provider may query the database by issuing one or more query requests to the data store . The snapshot object may be in accordance with a client object or data model different from the objects and associated data model used by the database . The database may include database tables of one or more lower level objects in accordance with a database data model different from the client data model. The database may be queried by the snapshot provider to obtain requested snapshot object properties including any such properties identifying an association or relationship to another object where the associations are stored in tables of the database .

In connection with populating the tables of the database the drivers collect information of the local service processor A which is reported through a call stack of software layers including code of the admin software layer PAL and data store where such information may then be stored in the database . The update manager may generate a request to poll the drivers of processor A and other processors for configuration state information describing the current configuration of the data storage system. The update manager may generate a polling request in response to an occurrence of an event such as an occurrence of a defined polling interval as well as an occurrence of one or more other defined events. The update manager may issue the request to the admin layer which then obtains the local state information for processor A from the drivers . The admin layer then communicates the state information for processor A to the PAL which then communicates the information to the data store . Additionally the admin software layer may communicate with the PAL of processor A to request configuration state information from processor B as illustrated by and described below in more detail. The data store may process the received state information e.g. for both processor A and B and then populates the database by performing database operations such as by issuing appropriate database commands including update insert and or delete database commands.

In one embodiment described herein the data store may perform processing to map the collected data such as received from PAL and the admin layer from an admin data model to another database model in accordance with the database . The admin data model may be referred to herein as the raw or admin data model where the collected data storage configuration data is in accordance with this admin data model such as used by the lower layers of software below PAL . The admin data model may be mapped to a database model of the database e.g. also analogous to the intermediate data model as may be referred to elsewhere herein . The database model may be further translated or mapped to the client data model which as described in more detail elsewhere herein may utilize virtual tables or views generated using queries run against the database tables of the database model and or admin data model.

PAL may serve as an interface facilitating communications between lower layers or software components e.g. such as the admin software layer and drivers and upper layers or software components e.g. such as the data storage and database . Upon the occurrence of a polling interval as signaled by the update manager PAL of service processor A may collect data from the local processor A s drivers and may also communicate with other PALs included in other service processors e.g. service processor B over the CMI connection . In turn the PAL of processor B not illustrated queries its local processor B s drivers for the information in a manner similar to that as described for processor A and returns the information to the requestor PAL of processor A. The requested information from both service processor A s drivers and from other service processors e.g. as communicated by PAL of processor B may be returned to the PAL of service processor A forwarded to data and then stored in database . The database of for the collected configuration state information may include data stored in one or more database tables where such tables include one or more rows of data elements. The data store may perform database operations which update the appropriate database tables of and portions thereof in accordance with the received state information. As described below the data store may use the techniques herein to map the collected data of the admin data model to data stored in the database in accordance with the database model which is then further used to generate data in accordance with a client data model.

Referring to shown is an example illustrating the general processing that may be performed in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The example includes data model 1 such as the admin data model as at a first or lower layer an intermediate or secondary mapping layer which may use an intermediate object model such as the database model mentioned above and data model 2 such as the client object data model at a third or highest layer . The techniques herein utilize the intermediate layer in connection with mapping or translating first objects of the first data model to second objects of the second data model . The data model 1 may represent the data model of the admin layer of the collected poling configuration information. Each time a new set of the collected data is received processing may be performed to map the objects in the first data model to objects of the intermediate mapping layer . Additional processing to generate objects of the second data model e.g. using objects of layers and or is not performed unless and until there is a request for one or more selected client model objects where such selected client data model objects are generated on demand e.g. on the fly in response to the request using one or more objects from the collected data of the first data model and or one or more objects from the intermediate mapping layer . The techniques herein take advantage of maintaining an up to date intermediate mapping layer set of objects so that when a request to generate an object in accordance with the client model data model 2 is received at least some of the processing steps have already been performed intermediate values obtained through the foregoing use of the intermediate mapping layer . In other words the processing necessary to generate objects of the second data model from objects of the first data model may be partitioned so that the intermediate mapping layer performs at least part of such processing. The remaining processing necessary to generate selected objects of the second data model may be performed on demand as needed in response to a request for such selected objects.

The foregoing use of the intermediate mapping layer is an alternative for example to waiting until the request is received prior to performing all processing necessary to generate the requested objects in the second data model. The foregoing use of the intermediate mapping layer is also an alternative for example to generating and maintaining a complete up to date e.g. cached set of objects of the second data model. In this latter case without using the intermediate mapping layer each time a new set of data is collected such as at each polling interval processing is performed to update the cached set of objects of the second data model in accordance with data changes and data dependencies on such changes. This may be performed even if there is no request for the objects in the second data model and may consume an unacceptable amount of resources in terms of memory usage processing time and the like. As will be described in more detail below an embodiment may have a first layer of software that generates objects of the first data model a second layer of software that performs processing of the intermediate mapping layer e.g. which may include generating one or more intermediate objects in accordance with an intermediate object model and a third layer of software that performs processing to generate objects of the second data model e.g. using one or more objects generated by the intermediate mapping layer and or objects included in the first data model generated by the first layer of software . An embodiment may also implement a variation of the foregoing where one or more objects of the second data model may be generated by the second or intermediate mapping layer as well as the third layer and or one or more intermediate objects e.g. not included in the first or second data models may be generated by the third layer as well as the second or intermediate mapping layer.

Various examples and embodiments are set forth below. In one embodiment set forth below the second or intermediate layer may populate database tables including association database tables. Such association database tables may group objects together such as in pairs based on relationships between objects included in a pair. In this case the processing performed by the second or intermediate layer may include computing and updating such relationships as needed in response to changes or updates as received for objects of the first data model e.g. data model 1 . As described below the differences in data obtained between two successive polling intervals may be determined by a first software layer such as the admin layer and the second or intermediate layer may perform processing responsive selectively to only such differences e.g. based on dependencies of objects used by the second intermediate layer upon such differences . The intermediate layer may selectively compute the associations based on such differences rather than for example computing and updating all associations and rather than for example computing and updating complete objects that may be referenced in the association. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art use of such associations as represented using association database tables in examples below provide an advantage of a reduction in computation time when used in generating an object of the second data model e.g. data model 2 such as the client data model when requested on demand. Furthermore as also described below an association database table may utilize only two primary keys per association relationship represented by a row of the database table where each of the primary keys identifies an object of the pair being associated with the other object of the pair. By storing the association database table including information representing the relationship between objects rather than requiring each such object of the relationship where such objects may be included in the second data model to also be maintained and stored the amount of memory used and computation performed in response to each polling update may be greatly reduced. Thus the techniques herein provide an advantage of scalability.

In connection with an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein communications between an initiator port of the host and a target port of a data storage system may include those related to I O operations for example read and write SCSI operations. The foregoing communications between the host and data storage system may be transmitted over a path or connection defined by two endpoints the initiator port of a host and the target port of the data storage system. The admin data model may collect information on a connection or a per path basis. In other words the admin layer may collect data with respect to physical connections. The objects of the admin data model may reflect this level of granularity and concept of paths or connections. However the admin data model e.g. corresponding to data model 1 may not have objects which correspond to other physical and or logical entities in the storage system such as a host storage pool snapshot and the like. For example the admin data model may include a single large path or connection object with information about the initiator port host including the initiator port target port and the like. Information regarding other entities such as the host storage pool snapshot etc. may be included or embedded as properties of the path objects. However objects of the client data model consumable by a client e.g. corresponding to data model 2 may have other entities including logical entities as the host storage group and the like which may be populated by aggregating analyzing and or selectively extracting data with respect to many objects such as path objects and other object of the admin data model. For example the user may request a list of hosts a list of ports on a particular host a list of all host ports a list of all target array or data storage system ports and the like. The client data model may include for example a host object snapshot object LUN object storage group object and the like as basic elements since such elements as objects are usable in connection with client requests. In order to generate the many different objects of the client data model multiple instances of admin data model objects may be processed and then selected information may be extracted from one or more such objects. In accordance with techniques herein the objects of the admin data model are transformed using the intermediate layer and one or more intermediate layer objects may be generated representing the partial processing described above. The intermediate layer objects may include for example associations and also intermediate calculations or intermediate processing results performed in advance of the request to generate one or more client model objects produced using such intermediate results e.g. dependent on the intermediate results . The associations of the intermediate or second layer may define some basic relationships e.g. between a host and initiator host and storage group initiator and path path and target path and session preferred path for particular host snapshot and source LUN and the like used for determining information for one or more client data model objects such as the snapshot object LUN object and the like. Thus the associations may be maintained and kept up to date in response to each polling interval. However the remaining processing which may use such associations to extract further information about a particular snapshot LUN one or more hosts initiators or target ports and the like in response to a user request is not performed until such a request is actually received e.g. on demand . Additionally the processing may be performed only to generate the objects of the client data model necessary to service the request. Furthermore in one embodiment the objects of the client data model generated may not be cached but may rather be generated on demand in response to each request. However the objects generated by the layers and may be stored for example in memory and or non volatile storage for subsequent use and updated in response to data received at each polling interval e.g. next set of collected data in the admin data model . The objects of the client data model may be generated using commands which utilize objects of the layers and or . In an embodiment in which the objects used by and are stored in database tables the commands may be queries e.g. such as SQL database queries to generate views corresponding to the objects of the client data model. The queries may use for example INNER JOIN clauses to join multiple database tables and extract the necessary information from objects of layers and or .

The application described herein with respect to an admin data model of objects transformed into another set of objects of the client data model is one exemplary use of the techniques herein with the intermediate mapping layer. Using such techniques one or more objects of the admin data model may be mapped to one or more objects of the intermediate database model and or client data model.

Referring to shown is an example illustrating some uses of the intermediate mapping layer in translating objects of a first data model to objects of a second different data model. Consistent with discussions such as in connection with the driver layer may provide data updates to the administrative layer which uses a first data model the admin data model. Objects of the admin data model may be mapped to other objects used by the intermediate object model such as of the database data storage layer e.g. corresponding to the data model used by and of . Objects of the intermediate object model or database model may be mapped to objects of the client data model such as used by the snapshot provider . Elements and correspond respectively to the layers and of and also respectively to layers and of . Elements may represent objects of the first data model used by layer such as for example those of the admin data model. Elements are objects generated by the intermediate layer or database data store layer and may be in accordance with an intermediate object model. Elements are objects of the second data model used by layer such as objects of the client data model. In the example each of the foregoing objects may have one or more properties or attributes. The lines connecting the various objects of the different layers may illustrate the dependencies between the different objects of the various layers whereby one or more objects of a lower layer may be used in determining properties of objects of an upper layer representing the lowest layer representing the next layer above and representing the uppermost layer . For example object includes properties based on properties of objects and whereby properties of may be copied directly from and or or otherwise dependent on such properties and or e.g. such as if includes a computation using one or more properties of and or . As another example client data model object includes properties based on and . For example as described elsewhere herein in more detail object may be a snapshot object and object may include the association between the snapshot object and the source LUN.

As described above in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein objects of layer may be received for example in response to a polling interval or other event occurrence. In response to receiving such objects of processing may be performed by the intermediate layer to generate objects . Objects of layer are not generated unless and until there is a request for such objects. When such a request is received for example for object processing is performed to generate using appropriate properties from objects . An embodiment may perform processing needed to generate objects as intermediate results prior to receiving a request for one or more objects of the layer which may use the values of the intermediate results in order to expedite processing of the request once received. Furthermore since the objects of layer are generated on demand there is no need to cache or store the requested objects of layer other than temporarily and then send the generated objects of layer to the client or requester. Thus caching storage may be conserved using the techniques herein over an implementation which may in contrast to techniques herein generate and cache all objects of ahead of time prior to receiving a request.

In response to receiving a request for objects the requested objects may be generated using predetermined commands. Such commands may provide for automated extraction calculations and or other processing of objects from layers and or to generate values used to populate objects . The foregoing are simplistic examples illustrating use of the techniques herein. In accordance with techniques herein the processing of the mapping layer may be performed in response to receiving an initial set of objects of layer and also in response to any changes for such objects as may be communicated in a subsequently received updated data set for the objects of layer . The objects of may be generated independently of when objects of layer or updated versions thereof are received. By using the foregoing partitioning of processing and layers to generate objects of layer changes to only objects of the second data model may be made while insulating or minimizing changes needed to other layers both code and data objects used therein . For example the layout of object may change so that an additional property value is added. The updated object structure for may be made by simply modifying the commands to extract data for example from object or . Furthermore objects or properties of objects included in layer may be selectively updated responsive to changes in objects used in layer . In this way each object in may be selectively updated recalculated based upon objects of that are dependent upon changes to properties objects in . Similarly objects and properties of may be selectively updated dependent upon changes or updates to properties objects of .

The foregoing example of represents one general way in which the techniques herein may be used. To further illustrate other ways in which the techniques herein may be used what will now be described is an example using the data storage configuration information and associations as may be used by the second or intermediate mapping layer in an embodiment.

Referring to shown is an example of a snapshot object as may be constructed and used by the snapshot provider in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The example includes a snapshot object with properties and . Each particular instance of a snapshot object may be uniquely identified by a snapshot identifier or snap ID . In this example the snapshot object may include property identifying a date as to when the snapshot was made property identifying the application or user that requested the snapshot and property identifying a LUN ID of the source LUN for the snapshot described by the object . Element represents a property that is an association or relationship to another object instance of a different object type in another structure such as another database table or structure. In this example the LUN ID of may be a foreign key that is a primary key or index into another table of LUN objects.

Referring to shown is an example of a LUN object as may be constructed and used by the LUN provider in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The LUN object may include property identifying the LUN storage capacity and property identifying the RAID level for the LUN described by . Element may represent the unique LUN ID used by the LUN provider to identify properties of a LUN instance. For example in one embodiment the LUN ID may be the LUN s WWN world wide name or identifier . In one embodiment the LUN objects of the LUN provider may be objects of the client data model generated dynamically or on demand in a manner similar to that as described herein for snapshot objects. As a variation the LUN objects of the LUN provider may be included in the client data model but may alternatively not be generated on demand. In one embodiment as described above where the LUN provider is included in legacy code and other providers of of are included in newer rewritten modules it may be that the LUN provider provides client data model objects which are not yet generated on demand as by the newer providers of . In any event shows an example of information that may be included in an instance of the LUN object in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein.

Referring to shown is an example of data tables that may be used in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The tables may be database tables included in the database of in accordance with the database model e.g. intermediate mapping layer data model . Table includes snapshot object property information for properties 1 and 2 e.g. for an of and table includes snapshot object property information for property 3 e.g. for of for the association or relationship to the source LUN object . The tables may be queried by the snapshot provider in connection with generating a snapshot object on demand. For example an SQL query including INNER JOIN statements may be used to combine properties from tables and to construct one or more snapshot objects.

The table is a table of associations between a snapshot object and a source LUN object where table may be generated by the second or intermediate mapping layer. In other words the second mapping layer may determine such associations or relationships between objects although the actual instances of the objects of the second data model themselves may not be generated as part of the second or intermediate mapping layer processing. In this embodiment objects of generated by the second mapping layer in may be stored in database tables having one or more primary keys PKs . A property of an object which is a PK for a database table including that object is denoted by the PK designation by the attribute e.g. Snap ID is the PK for tables ad . Each row of table may be joined with a row of table to obtain the aggregate set of properties snapshot objects as described in of the snapshot provider. Table may represent the LUN table including LUN object information used by the LUN provider. The table may include a row for each LUN object having a format as described in connection with . Table illustrates the PK as the LUN ID where each of the source LUN IDs of may be used as an index or foreign key into table . Each value in an entry of has a unique matching value in column of table .

Each association object included in table may include only two primary keys associated with two other objects denoting the association or relationship between such object instances.

With reference back to the snapshot object may be generated by extracting data from one or more objects of tables of the intermediate database layer on demand. As such in one embodiment the one or more snapshot objects may be views or virtual tables produced using queries of one or more tables of the lower intermediate database layer.

At runtime during operation of the system a set of admin data objects in accordance with the admin data model may be received upon the occurrence of every polling period. In response to receiving a set of such data processing may be performed to determine differences with respect to the current set of data. In response to any determined changes or differences the second or intermediate layer may perform operations to appropriately update delete and or create new objects with respect to those illustrated in tables . No snapshot objects may be yet created in response to the determined changes or differences in accordance with each new set of admin data model data received. Rather selected one or more snapshot objects as illustrated in may be created using one or more database tables such as tables in response to receiving a client request in order to service the received request using the selected objects.

As mentioned above the snapshot object may be created by extracting necessary data from tables such as tables of the database . Such extraction may be performed using SQL queries or other suitable commands. As an example with reference to INNER JOIN clauses of database queries may be used to extract the necessary data from such tables in generating a single requested snapshot object. The following is an example of an SQL query as may be performed to construct a snapshot object denoted as SNAP2 for the snapshot having a snap ID of as represented by element of . For example the client request may identify SnapID 2 as the snapshot for which a LUN object corresponding to the source LUN of SnapID 2 object is requested. For shorthand purposes table is denoted as T1 and table is denoted as T2 in the following SQL statement 

In element the snapshot object has a primary key of SnapID 2 with properties denoted by DATE property 1 CREATOR property 2 and LUN ID property 3 .

A JOIN clause combines records e.g. rows or entries from two or more database tables resulting in a set that can be saved as a table or used as is. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each. An INNER JOIN creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables e.g. A and B based upon the join predicate. The query compares each row of A with each row of B to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join predicate. When the join predicate is satisfied column values for each matched pair of rows of A and B are combined into a result row. The result of the join can be defined as the outcome of first taking the Cartesian product e.g. intersection or cross join of all records in the tables combining every record in table A with every record in table B . All records which satisfy the join predicate are returned. The From clause of the Select statement of as included in line 6 above lists the tables to be joined. Line 7 specifies the predicate or criteria which must be satisfied using the ON keyword. For the matching joined table entry the above statement in lines 2 5 denote the properties of the database tables which are extracted and mapped to corresponding properties of the snapshot object . The two tables that are INNER JOINed are T1 and T2 having matching entries meeting the criteria of the ON clause e.g. T1 . SnapID T2. SnapID AND T1 . SnapID 2 . Thus the foregoing illustrates how an association may be used in connection with an INNER JOIN to extract information from objects of lower layers e.g. intermediate and lower layer to generate object in the upper most layer.

The snapshot object may be constructed by the snapshot provider and returned to the business logic provider which then extracts the property LUN ID A property 3 and passes this to the LUN provider. In turn the LUN provider may return the object or row 1 of the table where the LUN ID of column is A .

In the foregoing it should be noted that the database may include one or more tables having different configurations and organizations than as illustrated above for purposes of example of the techniques herein.

Referring to shown is a flowchart of processing steps as may be performed in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The flowchart summarizes processing steps described above in connection with creating a snapshot object and using a property thereof denoting an associated source LUN to obtain a LUN object corresponding to the source LUN for the snapshot. At step a client request is received by the data storage system at the provider manager. The client request may identify the SnapID of the snapshot. For example the SnapID may be 2 as described above. The client may be requesting a LUN object for which the source LUN of the snapshot denoted by SnapID. At step the request is sent to the business logic provider which issues a request to the services provider subset manager for the snapshot object having the SnapID 2. At step the services provider subset manager requests the snapshot object for SnapID 2 from the snapshot provider. The snapshot provider queries the database to obtain the information for the snapshot object e.g. the snapshot object properties . At step the snapshot object including the snapshot object properties is returned to the business logic provider. At step the business logic provider uses the snapshot property identifying the source LUN to obtain the desired LUN object information from the LUN provider. In step the business logic provider returns the LUN object for the source LUN to the client via the provider manager.

In connection with the foregoing the database tables may be used to store foreign primary keys of other data structures as may be used by other providers such as the LUN provider. The business logic provider may be characterized as a coordinator and collector of information from various providers in order to return requested information to the client. In one aspect the business logic provider may function as a layer that insulates the client from underlying data model changes and also any changes in the business logic operations tasks performed to obtain the data requested by the client.

In connection with the components described in connection with other providers as may be included in or may be a CLONE provider e.g. return information about clones such as copies of LUNs PROVISIONING provider e.g. to return information regarding data storage provisioning STORAGE POOL provider e.g. to return information regarding a defined storage pool from which LUNs may be formed created MIRROR PROVIDER e.g. to return information about LUN mirrors and the like.

It should be noted that the database data store mapping layers associations and the like as described herein are also described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 065 735 filed Mar. 29 2011 TECHNIQUES FOR MAPPING DATA MODELS USING AN INTERMEDIATE PROCESSING LAYER to Kim et al. which is incorporated by reference herein.

Referring to shown is an illustration of communications between the different providers in connection with the process of . In the example the client may issue a request to list a single SNAP identified by the snapshot identifier Snap ID S1 which is a snapshot of a consistency group see below having several LUNs. The business logic provider may receive the request and issue a request to the snapshot provider for the snapshot object as denoted by S1. Element denotes this request and response between providers and which result in returning the snapshot object for S1 to the business logic provider . The business logic provider retrieves the each property LUN ID from the snapshot object for the source LUNs of the snapshot. As described herein LUN ID included in the snapshot object may be based on a defined association or relationship between the snapshot object for a snap LUN and the LUN object for the source LUN of the snap LUN. The LUN ID may be characterized as a foreign key or index into a table used by the LUN provider to obtain the LUN object information of the source LUN of SNAP LUN A. The foreign key or index may be characterized as foreign or externally used by a provider other than the snapshot provider. As represented by the business logic provider issues a request to LUN provider using the LUN ID for each LUN to obtain the LUN object information for each LUN. Subsequently the business logic provider may return a response to the client which includes the information for the snap object S1 as well as the information for each LUN object associated with S1.

The above process of works well for what might be viewed as targeted requests i.e. requesting information for only one or a small number of objects. In order to identify the LUN objects associated with a Snap object it is necessary for the snapshot provider to traverse the association table and then for each associated LUN it is necessary for the business logic provider and LUN provider to engage in a request lookup and response. If there are a large number of LUNs associated with each Snap then this process may be very inefficient if information about a large number of Snaps is requested. Such bulk requests may be supported however for example requests to list all the Snaps or all the LUNs. If such a request were to be processed in the above manner response time would suffer and there would be excessive use of system resources simply performing a large number of database lookups. These problems are avoided by a technique described below that uses a leaner dedicated structure to store limited information about associated objects enabling a relatively fast and efficient initial response to a bulk request enabling a user to then issue targeted requests for additional information as may be desired.

It will be appreciated that a process similar to that described above may be used in the opposite direction i.e. to obtain the information about all the Snaps associated with a LUN in response to a request for information about a LUN. This operation may be the more anticipated and intensive case in a system that makes extensive use of Snaps as mentioned above.

Referring to flowcharts are shown of processing steps that may be performed in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The steps of and summarize processing described above. The flowchart illustrates steps that may be performed in connection with processing data collected at polling intervals. At step a determination is made as to whether the next polling interval has occurred. If not processing waits at step until such time has occurred when a set of data has been collected in accordance with the admin data model such as by the layer. At step the collected data in accordance with the admin data model may be received by the data store of . At step the data store or other module as may vary with embodiment may perform processing as associated with the intermediate or secondary mapping layer to create and or update objects generated by the intermediate layer. Such objects may include associations and or other intermediate objects not included in the second or client data model. Alternatively an embodiment also have the second mapping layer generate one or more objects of the client data model. The foregoing may vary with embodiment and usage of the techniques herein. From step control returns to step to wait for the next set of collected data in accordance with the admin data model.

With reference to shown is a flowchart of processing steps that may be performed in an embodiment of the techniques herein to process a received request for one or more client data model objects. At step a determination is made as to whether a request for one or more client data model objects has been received. If not processing waits at step until such a request is received. In response to receiving the request control then proceeds to step to processing the request for one or more objects of the client data model. Step may include generating the requested client objects using one or more objects generated by the intermediate layer e.g. of or otherwise included in the collected data of the lowest layer in accordance with the admin data model. Step may include generating one or more client model data objects on demand such as using commands to extract the necessary data as described above by generating views from real database tables including objects generated by layer or included in the admin data model.

As described above with reference to the business logic provider may be characterized as a middle layer functioning in one aspect as a bridge between the client and other providers e.g. providers of and to perform an operation of a request. In another aspect the business logic provider may be characterized as a gathering point for gathering information between horizontal components such as the other providers whereby the business logic provider may gather information from any of the other providers and the client may issue requests to the business logic provider directly rather than have the client communicate directly with each of the one or more other providers. In this manner the business logic provider may provide the client with an interface used to invoke code of the business logic provider . Such code of business logic provider may perform consolidated processing that encapsulates communications between multiple other providers and may perform other processing such as validation processing described below rather than expose the client to the different interfaces of all the other providers necessary to perform a desired client request and rather than have the client be responsible for performing such validation processing.

In one embodiment the components of may be included in a first framework and the components and may be included in a second framework different from the first framework. All providers in the same framework may communicate with one another using one common set of intra framework or inter provider communications for use within the single framework. Each framework may have its own framework specific set of classes or other definitions used by providers within the single framework. However modules or providers in different frameworks cannot utilize such intra framework communications the communications used between providers of the same framework to communicate. As described above and also in following paragraphs the business logic provider facilitates communications between providers in the two frameworks e.g. such as between the storage device or LUN provider and the snapshot provider . The business logic provider may also use data from such different providers of different frameworks and may perform additional processing such as extra checks for valid conditions to ensure desired restrictions are not violated prior to performing processing for one or more operations of a client request. For some operations the business logic may perform processing based on defined associations identifying relationships between objects used by different providers and also between objects of different frameworks. There may also be logic embodied in the business logic provider to perform runtime checks or validation of existing conditions for one or more objects. More specifically the business logic provider may perform such runtime checks that may use for example information of two associated objects of the same or of different frameworks to ensure a valid or desired state exists with respect to the requested operation on the two associated objects. This may be characterized as validation processing or restriction checking to ensure that one or more entities in the data storage system have a suitable current state to perform a requested operation. The state of an entity may be characterized by information of an object representing that entity such as by the mere existence of a particular object based on defined object properties and the like.

As a second example illustrating data validation processing to check whether there are any restriction violations consider a case where there is a defined consistency group of LUNs for use in connection with performing snapshot operations. In some applications it may be important that a set of LUNs are replicated such as in connection with snapshots as a content coherent set. In one embodiment a consistency group CG may be defined as set of LUNs to enable such a set of content related LUNS to be replicated as a single entity for maintaining data consistency and write order fidelity across all LUNs in the CG. Write order fidelity is the ability to preserve or keep data at the target or in the snapshot created in the same order as in the production site. When performing a snapshot operation with the above mentioned CG feature a single snapshot request may replicate all LUNs in the CG as one logical action creating a snapshot of each LUN in the CG ensuring that snapshot LUNs of the CG are guaranteed to be identical point in time dependent write consistent restartable snapshots with respect to other LUNs in the same CG.

In this second example let LUN A be included in a defined existing CG when the client sends to the business logic provider a request to destroy LUN A. A destroy operation with respect to a LUN may be characterized as an operation that undefines unconfigures or disassociates the LUN from its underlying bound or provisioned storage and results in removing the destroyed LUN as an existing entity in the data storage system. A restriction may be specified whereby a LUN may not be destroyed if the LUN is a member of a CG. The snapshot provider may be the provider to utilize to obtain consistency group information. In this manner the business logic provider may communicate with the snapshot provider to determine whether LUN A belongs to any defined CG. If so the business logic provider may determine that the above mentioned restriction has been violated and not allow the requested destroy operation to proceed. Alternatively if the restriction has not been violated the destroy operation may be performed by the business logic provider communicating with the LUN provider to destroy LUN A.

Referring to an example is shown of data tables that may be used in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The tables may be database tables included in the database of . Table may include CG property information e.g. such as additional property information besides that as included in element of and table includes CG object property information for property 1 e.g. for of for the association or relationship to the LUNs in this CG . The tables may be queried by the snapshot provider in connection with generating a CG object on demand. In this example for simplicity it is noted that the CG object is illustrated as only including the list of LUNs for the CG and no additional properties. Additionally following is example of an SQL query that may be used in connection with determining the list of LUNs for the CG . However in the following exemplary SQL statement it should be noted that each LUN may be returned as a separate row of information rather than in the form of a combined list as represented by property 1 . The following SQL query including INNER JOIN statements may be used to combine properties from tables and to construct a CG object .

The table is a table of associations between a CG and a LUN object where table . Each row of table may be joined with a row of table to obtain the aggregate set or list of LUNs for the desired CG. Each association object included in table may include only two primary keys associated with two other objects denoting the association or relationship between such object instances. Element may denote a particular CG having a CG ID which is a primary key PK into table . Element may denote a particular LUN having the LUN ID which may be used as a PK into a LUN table as used by the LUN provider and described elsewhere herein . Additionally the LUN ID of the LUN to be destroyed also denoted an occurrence of a PK into the LUN table not illustrated in this example . Thus validation processing of the business logic provider as described above for the destroy operation for destroying a specified LUN ID may include examining the list of LUNs returned from this query for a CG e.g. to determine whether the LUN ID of the destroy operation matches any LUN on the list for the CG returned by SQL query .

In a manner similar to as described herein for the snapshot object the CG object may be created by extracting necessary data from tables such as tables of the database . Such extraction may be performed using SQL queries or other suitable commands. As an example with reference to INNER JOIN clauses of database queries may be used to extract the necessary data from such tables in generating a single requested snapshot object.

The following is an example of a description representing logic that may be performed using any suitable commands such as SQL query statement s to construct a view for a CG object denoted as CG2 having a CG ID of as represented by element of . For example in connection with traversing through the list of defined CGs as discussed above the second defined CG may have an object identified as having CG ID 2. For shorthand purposes table is denoted as T1 and table is denoted as T2 in the following SQL statement 

In element the CG object has a primary key of CGID 2 with the returned list of LUNs from the above referenced query included as the list of LUNs in the CG property 1 .

Traditionally snapshots have been used relatively infrequently to facilitate backup or some other operation. Usage has evolved such that in many systems snapshots are taken quite frequently for any of a variety of purposes. For example they may be taken at intervals of 5 or 10 minutes and be usable for fine grained online restoration or recovery. Thus in a large system there may be hundreds or thousands of LUNs and for many of the LUNs potentially hundreds or thousands of SNAPs.

Among the commands or requests used by the client may be a bulk type of request to retrieve information about a large number of objects. One example is a Snap List request requesting a listing of all snap objects in the system. An analogous request is a LUN List request requesting a listing of all LUN objects in the system. In some systems it may be the practice to deliver information about all associated objects when providing information about an object. Thus for a LUN List request for example it may be desired to return full information about all the LUNs as well as about all the Snaps for each LUN. If the techniques of above were to be used and just repeated as needed for all of the objects it might be problematic. Such processing would require numerous traversals of the association table in order to just identify all the associated Snap objects and a corresponding number of interrogations of the LUN table via the LUN provider . The processing burden scales linearly with the number of objects which in general is growing exponentially with more extensive use of SNAPs. Depending on the number of objects and the amount of processing power available there is likely some threshold number of objects for which it is not practical to obtain information in this manner. While the traversing method will work well with a smaller number of objects it becomes a performance bottleneck when the system scales up. Thus an alternative technique for handling bulk requests is described that greatly reduces the number of association calls as many as there are LUNs to one API call.

Referring to shown are examples of lookup structures that may be used in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The structures may be hash tables or similar structures. The Snapshot LUN ID structure is maintained by the snapshot provider while the LUN SNAP ID structure is maintained by the LUN provider . Structure includes a limited amount of information about LUNs associated with snapshot objects in the illustrated example only the LUN IDs . Similarly the structure includes a limited amount of information about SNAPs associated with LUN objects in the illustrated example only the SNAP IDs . The purpose is to quickly and efficiently obtain this limited information about associated objects when retrieving information about a large number of objects. This avoids the multiplication effect discussed above when a large number of traversals of an association table e.g. table of is made. The structures are used in conjunction with separate APIs referred as performance APIs provided by the snapshot provider and LUN provider to support bulk requests such as Snap List and LUN List requests as discussed above. The structure is queried by the snapshot provider based on a request from the client via the provider manager . Similarly the structure is queried by the LUN provider based on a request from the client via the provider manager .

Referring to shown is an illustration of communications between the different providers in connection with processing of a bulk request briefly mentioned above. In the example the client may issue a request to list all the SNAPs. The business logic provider may receive the request and issue a series of requests to the snapshot provider for each of the snapshot objects in existence. Element denotes these requests and responses between providers and which result in returning the snapshot objects to the business logic provider .

In contrast to the process of the business logic provider does not then interrogate the LUN provider for the LUN information of each LUN associated with each of the Snaps as this would potentially be very slow and inefficient as mentioned above. Rather the client request also results in a call directly to the snapshot provider via a separate interface termed a performance API herein that will return the limited LUN information for each of the Snaps using the Snapshot LUN lookup structure of . This structure can be traversed much more efficiently than the entire set of LUN tables . This more efficient traversal comes at the expense of obtaining much more limited information about the associated LUNs in the example only the LUN ID which is the externally visible identifier of a LUN such as its WWN . However for a bulk request a user generally cannot digest all the detailed LUN information anyway at least not immediately. It is more efficient to first present just the LUN identifiers and to leave it to the user to specifically request using more targeted requests information about the LUNs. The business logic provider returns a response to the client which includes the information for each snap object while the snapshot provider returns the LUN IDs of the LUNs associated with each snap object.

Referring to shown is a flowchart of processing steps as may be performed in an embodiment in accordance with techniques herein. The flowchart summarizes processing steps described above in connection with a bulk request for snapshot object information. At step a client request is received by the data storage system at the provider manager. The client request is of a bulk type such as a Snap List command. At step the request is sent to the business logic provider which issues requests to the services provider subset manager for each snapshot object in the system. At step the services provider subset manager requests each snapshot object from the snapshot provider using the standard API. The snapshot provider queries the database to obtain the information for each snapshot object e.g. the snapshot object properties . At the services provider subset manager also requests via the separate performance API as described above the limited LUN information e.g. LUN IDs of the LUNs associated with the snapshot objects. At step each snapshot object including the snapshot object properties is returned to the business logic provider and at the business logic provider returns the snapshot objects to the provider manager for sending to the client . Also at the snapshot provider returns the limited LUN information LUN IDs of the snap objects via the provider manager.
