The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore unless otherwise indicated it should not be assumed that any of the approaches described in this section qualify as prior art merely by virtue of their inclusion in this section.

Currently accounting for business expenditures is a painstaking and time consuming activity. The receipts relating to an expenditure must be collected itemized and entered manually into a form. The receipt must then be reconciled with any credit card information available from a credit card service that processed a credit card used in the making the expenditure. If a person made the expenditure with a personal credit card then a credit card statement for the expenditure must be collected from the person using the credit card. If the person made the expenditure with cash then there is no credit card data with which to reconcile the receipt. Not only do the above activities take time but they also delay reimbursement to the person making the expenditure.

One embodiment of the present invention is a method for generating expense data for an expense report. The method includes receiving receipt data that includes one or more data items pertaining to a transaction where the one or more data items are obtained from characters optically recognized in receipt image data for the transaction and the receipt data includes data indicating that the transaction is a credit card transaction and creating expense data for the expense report where the expense data includes the receipt data and the receipt image data associated with the receipt data for the transaction and the receipt data includes credit card data.

Another embodiment is a system for generating expense data for an expense report. The system includes an interface to a receipt image processing system and an expense data generator. The interface to a receipt image processing system receives receipt image data optically recognizes characters in the receipt image data and provides receipt data obtained from the recognized characters where the receipt data includes one or more data items pertaining to a transaction and indicates whether the transaction is a credit card transaction or a cash transaction. The expense data generator receives receipt data and creates expense data for the expense report where the expense data includes the receipt data and the receipt image data associated with the receipt data for the transaction.

In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding. It will be apparent however that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are depicted in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

An embodiment obtains data from a receipt and matches the data with credit card information if the transaction recorded on the receipt is a credit card transaction. An expense report is generated based the receipt data and the credit card transaction data. In the description that follows it is understood that while the term credit card is used for purposes of explanation the term includes without limitation any form of payment that involves the use of crediting or debiting of an account and is not limited to credit debit or ATM cards. For example the approach is applicable to transactions involving the use of credit cards debit cards and ATM cards as well as transactions that are performed using wireless communications for example via mobile devices PDAs cell phones tablet computers laptop computers etc.

The expense report system receives the receipt image data via link from the receipt image capture devices credit card data from the credit card services via link and receipt data from the receipt image processing services via link . The receipt image processing services receives the receipt image data from the expense report system optically recognizes the characters in the receipt image data and extracts relevant receipt data from the receipt image data . Once the expense report system obtains the receipt data the expense report system associates the receipt data and receipt image data with respective credit card data and creates expense data for an expense report .

The expense report system receives the receipt image data from the receipt image processing services via link credit card data from the credit card services via link and receipt data from the receipt image processing services via link . The receipt image processing services receives the receipt image data from the receipt image capture devices via link optically recognizes the characters in the receipt image data and extracts relevant receipt data from the receipt image data . Once the expense report system obtains the receipt data the expense report system associates the receipt data and receipt image data with respective credit card data and creates expense data for an expense report .

The receipt image data is stored in either persistent or non persistent storage in a system hosting receipt image processing services . The OCR engine is aided by a data verifier which includes a user interface to help increase the accuracy of the extracted receipt data. The database stores the receipt data extracted from the receipt image data . The Application Programming Interface provides a programming interface for communicating with external systems such as the expense report system in or the image capture devices in .

Data items are recognized by an OCR engine in . According to one embodiment one or more uncertainty parameters such as parameter are associated with one or more of these data items. An uncertainty parameter provides an indication of the expected accuracy of the OCR process with respect to one or more corresponding data items. Uncertainty parameters may be expressed in a wide variety of forms depending upon a particular implementation. For example an uncertainty parameter may be expressed as a numerical value between 0 and 1 where 0 represents the lowest level of uncertainty and a 1 represents the highest level of certainty. Uncertainty parameters may be generated and stored by receipt image processing services .

According to one embodiment the uncertainty parameters are displayed on a graphical user interface to provide a visual indication to a user of the expected accuracy of the OCR process with respect to certain data items. For example when the uncertainty parameter for a data item is below a threshold the system depicts blank values in the user interfaces depicted in thereby flagging a user as to the uncertainty of the data. In the data verification user interfaces depicted a user has an option to correct the data value and area on the receipt image data and associate the area with respective data item of interest. When a user makes such a correction the changes are fed back to the OCR engine in to improve accuracy when OCR engine comes across similar receipt image data.

The example user interface depicted in includes data areas in the receipt image and data items in the receipt data for a particular item item 1 in the receipt image when the data is correctly captured by the OCR engine . The data areas in the receipt image include a vendor merchant name the transaction date the item 1 description the transaction amount a credit debit card type and the credit debit card number . The receipt data for item 1 includes the vendor merchant name the transaction date the item 1 description the transaction amount the credit debit card number and the credit debit card type . Additionally the receipt data depicted includes a cash radio button and a credit radio button which for the case depicted is marked because the item 1 transaction is a credit transaction. The figure illustrates that the OCR engine identified the receipt data for item 1 correctly and accurately because each data area in the receipt image pertaining to item 1 has a corresponding data item in the receipt data for item 1 that is correctly captured. Additionally an accuracy scale indicates to the user that the receipt data is correct and accurate.

The user interfaces depicted in and illustrate how a user can improve the ability of the OCR engine to capture data from receipt image data.

Sometimes the OCR engine captures a data area on the receipt image but does so inaccurately. The data item in the receipt data is not blank but the data in the data item is not accurate according to the receipt image. illustrate this case.

In some of the data items in the receipt data do not match the corresponding data areas in the receipt image . In the figure data areas of the receipt image include vendor merchant name the transaction date the item description the transaction amount the credit debit card type and the credit debit card number . The data items of the receipt data include the vendor merchant name the transaction date the item description the transaction amount the credit debit card number and the credit debit card type . The credit radio button is marked. However while the other captured data items in the receipt data for item 1 match the data areas in the receipt image for item 1 the transaction amount on the receipt image does not match the captured transaction amount in the receipt data and the credit debit card number on the receipt image does not match the captured credit debit card number in the receipt data . Additionally an accuracy scale indicates that the receipt data accuracy is less than 100 .

In a user corrects the inaccurate data items in the receipt depicted in . In the figure the data areas in receipt image include the vendor merchant name the transaction date the item description the transaction amount the credit debit card type and the credit debit card number . The data items in the receipt data include the vendor merchant name the transaction data the item description the transaction amount the credit debit card number and the credit debit card type . The credit radio button is marked. In the figure a user has corrected the transaction amount and the credit debit card number to match the data for those items in the receipt image thereby raising the accuracy indicator to 100 . The corrected transaction amount and credit debit card number are supplied to the OCR engine to improve its accuracy. Additionally data areas for those items are delineated to further aid the OCR engine .
