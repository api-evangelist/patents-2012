This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 139 005 which is now U.S. Pat. No. 8 237 554 filed Jun. 13 2008 the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

The embodiments described herein generally relate to a system and method for programming keys to a vehicle to establish primary and secondary drivers.

With conventional automotive vehicles one or more keys are often shared between any number of drivers. For example the parents of a teenager or young adult that is old enough to drive may share the keys for the vehicle with the teenager. The vehicle may be equipped with various safety and or driver notification features that may be enabled disabled via a user interface based on the driver s needs. However in some circumstances the parent may not intend to have the various safety and notification related features disabled by the teenager. The parent may enable the safety and notification features prior to allowing the teenager to drive the vehicle however there is no guarantee that the teenager may keep the safety and notification features enabled while driving the vehicle. Conventional vehicles fail to give parents or other such primary driver the option of preventing teenagers eligible to driver or other such secondary drivers from disabling safety and notification features.

In light of the foregoing it is generally necessary to differentiate between the drivers so that a determination can be made as to when a particular vehicle system should prevent the disabling of such safety and notification features or other features in the event the driver is detected to be a teenager or other such secondary driver. Further such a determination may be needed to ensure that the primary driver is allowed to disable the safety and notification features as desired. As recognized the safety and notification features are generally arranged such that a primary driver may disable the features in the event such features are not desired and are not mandatorily imposed by law or other such ordinance.

In at least one embodiment a method for programming keys to a vehicle to establish primary keys and secondary keys to control vehicle functionality is disclosed. The method comprises receiving a key identification signal from a first key. The method further comprises generating a key status signal indicative of whether the first key is one of a primary key and a secondary key in response to the key identification signal. The method further comprises transmitting the key status signal to a vehicle interface display. The method further comprises allowing a user to change a status of at least one of the first key and an additional key with the vehicle interface display in response to determining that the key status signal corresponds to the primary key.

As required detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein however it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.

The embodiments of the present invention generally provides for a driver identification functional operation whereby primary and secondary drivers are determined and various levels of control are granted to the driver based on whether the driver is the primary driver or the secondary driver. In general the primary driver may be defined as the administrative driver who has greater control over the functionality of the various safety and or notification features in the vehicle. The secondary driver may be defined as a restricted driver who has limited control over the safety and or notification features generally provided by the vehicle and is to abide by the functional restrictions imposed or selected by the vehicle or the primary driver. The embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for allowing primary drivers the ability to program keys to the vehicle to designate a key as a secondary key for use by the secondary driver. The various operations that are capable of being controlled based on driver status include but are not limited to inhibiting a seatbelt restraint status disable inhibiting a forward collision warning FCW disable inhibiting an electronic stability control ESC disable inhibiting a traction control TC disable adjusting the operation of a low fluid level warning or low fuel level warning inhibiting the user from inputting data via touch entry into communication devices inhibiting blind spot monitoring BSM and cross traffic alert CTA disable.

The embodiments of the present invention as set forth in generally illustrate and describe a plurality of controllers or modules or other such electrically based components. All references to the various controllers and electrically based components and the functionality provided for each are not intended to be limited to encompassing only what is illustrated and described herein. While particular labels may be assigned to the various controllers and or electrical components disclosed such labels are not intended to limit the scope of operation for the controllers and or the electrical components. The controllers or modules may be combined with each other and or separated in any manner based on the particular type of electrical architecture that is desired or intended to be implemented in the vehicle.

Referring now to a system for programming keys to a vehicle to establish primary and secondary drivers in accordance to one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The system includes a vehicle interface display a body electronics controller and a passive anti theft security PATS controller . The vehicle interface display may be implemented as a message center on an instrument cluster or as a touch screen monitor such that each device is generally configured to present text menu options status or other such inquiries to the driver in a visual format. A driver may scroll through the various fields of text and select menu options via at least one switch positioned about the interface display . The switch may be remotely positioned from the interface display or positioned directly on the interface display . The vehicle interface display may be any such device that is generally situated to provide information and receive feedback to from a vehicle occupant. The switches may be in the form of voice commands touch screen and or other such external devices e.g. phones computers etc. that are generally configured to communicate with the electrical system of the vehicle.

The interface display the PATS controller and the body electronics controller may communicate with each other via a multiplexed data link communication bus or multiplexed bus . The multiplexed bus may be implemented as a High Medium Speed Controller Area Network CAN bus a Local Interconnect Network LIN or any such suitable data link communication bus generally situated to facilitate data transfer between controllers or modules in the vehicle.

The body electronics controller generally controls a portion or all of the electrical content in an interior section of the vehicle. In one example the body electronics controller may be a smart power distribution junction box SPDJB controller. The SPDJB controller may include a plurality of fuses relays and various micro controllers for performing any number of functions related to the operation of interior and or exterior electrically based vehicle functionality. Such functions may include but are not limited to electronic unlocking locking via interior door lock unlock switches remote keyless entry operation vehicle lighting interior and or exterior electronic power windows and or key ignition status e.g. Off Run Start Accessory ACCY .

An ignition switch may be operably coupled to the body electronics controller . The body electronics controller may receive hardwired signals indicative of the position of the ignition switch and transmit multiplexed messages on the multiplexed bus that are indicative of the position of the ignition switch. For example the body electronics controller may transmit a signal IGN SW STS e.g. whether the ignition is in the OFF Run Start or Accessory ACCY positions over the multiplexed bus to the vehicle interface display . The signal IGN SW STS generally corresponds to the position of the ignition switch e.g. Off Run Start or Accessory positions .

The ignition switch may receive two or more keys to start the vehicle. Each key includes an ignition key device embedded therein for communicating with the vehicle. The ignition key device comprises a transponder not shown . The transponder includes an integrated circuit and an antenna. The transponder is adapted to transmit a signal KEY ID in the form of a radio frequency RF signal to the PATS controller . The signal KEY ID generally comprises RF data that corresponds to a manufacturer code a corresponding key serial number and encrypted data. The key serial number and the encrypted data are used to authorize the engine controller to start the vehicle in the event the encrypted data corresponds to predetermined encrypted data stored in a look up table LUT of the PATS controller . The PATS controller may use the key number and or the encrypted data transmitted on the signal KEY ID to determine if the key is a primary key or a secondary key. In general the driver who holds the primary key is presumed to be a primary driver. The driver who holds the secondary key is presumed to be a secondary driver. The manufacturer code generally corresponds to who the manufacturer of the vehicle is. For example the manufacturer code may correspond to Ford Motor Company. Such a code prevents the user or technician from mistakenly configuring a key with a manufacturer code of another vehicle manufacturer to a Ford vehicle. An example of a LUT that may be stored in the PATS controller is shown in TABLE 1 directly below.

The LUT may include any number of keys. To start the vehicle the PATS controller decodes the key serial number the manufacturing code and corresponding encrypted data received on the signal KEY ID and compares such data to the key serial number and the encrypted data in the LUT to determine whether such data match prior to starting the vehicle for anti theft purposes. In the event the data matches the engine controller operably coupled to the PATS controller allows the vehicle to start the engine.

To determine driver status the PATS controller decodes the key number and or the encrypted data received on the signal KEY ID and reads the corresponding key status e.g. primary or secondary next to the key number and or the encrypted data as shown in the heading TYPE of Table 1 to determine whether the key is the primary key or the secondary key. The PATS controller transmits a signal KEY STATUS to the vehicle interface display to indicate whether the key is a primary key or a secondary key. The PATS controller and or the vehicle interface display may transmit the signal KEY STATUS to any controller or module in the electrical system such that the functionality or operation performed by a particular controller or module may be selectively controlled based on the key status and or the driver status . For example seat belt minder fuel level indicator reverse park aid object detection and traction control as found in U.S. patent Ser. No. 12 026 582 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING A SAFETY RESTRAINT STATUS BASED ON DRIVER STATUS and filed on Feb. 6 2008 U.S. Publication No. 2009 0079622 Ser. No. 12 026 857 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING EARLY LOW FUEL WARNING BASED ON DRIVER STATUS and filed on Feb. 6 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 106 759 Ser. No. 12 026 867 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL BASED ON DRIVER STATUS and filed on Feb. 6 2008 now U.S. Pat. No 8 280 580 and Ser. No. 12 026 872 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING OBJECT DETECTION BASED ON DRIVER STATUS and filed on Feb. 6 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 306 728 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety and are illustrative of the types of functionality or operations that may be selectively controlled based on the driver status of the vehicle.

Additional functionality such as blind spot monitoring and cross traffic alert preventing the user from inputting data via touch entry into the communication device and preventing the user from disabling an emergency call feature as found in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009 0312914 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT BASED ON DRIVER STATUS and filed on Jun. 13 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 103 412 U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009 0312901 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING AN OCCUPANT COMMUNICATION DEVICE BASED ON DRIVER STATUS and filed on Jun. 13 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 718 866 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009 0312902 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION OPERATION BASED ON DRIVER STATUS and filed on Jun. 13 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 467 933 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety are illustrative of the types of functionality or operations that may be selectively controlled based on the driver status of the vehicle.

The LUT in the PATS controller assigns all of the keys as primary keys when the vehicle is manufactured in a default condition. The PATS controller may update the key status for a key number in response to the driver changing the key status for a particular key via operations performed between the primary driver and the vehicle interface display . Such operations will be discussed in more detail in connection with .

The primary driver may optionally clear all keys that were designated as secondary keys via the vehicle interface display . In such a case the primary driver may select the corresponding menus via the vehicle interface display to clear all keys that were programmed as secondary keys. The vehicle interface display transmits a signal CLEAR to control the PATS controller to clear or change the secondary keys to primary keys. The PATS controller may transmit a signal CLEAR STATUS to the vehicle interface display to notify the vehicle interface display that the keys programmed as secondary keys have been changed to primary keys. The PATS controller transmits signals PRIKEYS and SECKEYS to the interface display which are indicative of the number of primary keys in the LUT and the number of secondary keys in the LUT respectively. The PATS controller transmits the signals PRIKEYS and SECKEYS in response to control signals not shown by the vehicle interface display . It is generally contemplated that the signals KEY STATUS PRIKEYS and SECKEYS as well as the signal CLEAR STATUS may be sent as one or more messages over the multiplexed bus to the vehicle interface display . For example the data on the signals KEY STATUS PRIKEYS SECKEYS CLEAR STATUS may be transmitted as hexadecimal based data within a single message over the multiplexed data bus. Likewise the vehicle interface display may transmit the data on the signals CHANGE REQ and CLEAR as hexadecimal based data within a single message over the multiplexed data bus. The PATS controller may be integrated within the vehicle interface display or be implemented as a standalone component or as controller embedded within another controller in the vehicle.

Referring now to a system for programming keys to a vehicle to establish primary and secondary drivers in accordance to one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The system includes the vehicle interface display a passive entry passive start PEPS controller and a backup slot . The PEPS controller may be used in place of the PATS controller as illustrated in . While generally illustrates that the PEPS controller is positioned external to the vehicle interface display other such implementations may include positioning the PEPS controller within the vehicle interface display or within any other such controller in the vehicle. The particular placement of the PEPS controller may vary based on the desired criteria of a particular implementation.

In general the PEPS function is a keyless access and start system. The driver may own two or more keys that may be in the form of an electronic transmission device e.g. a key fob . With the PEPS implementation the user is not required to use a mechanical key blade to open the door of the vehicle or to start the vehicle. Such key may each include a mechanical key to ensure that the driver can access and start the vehicle in the event the keys exhibit low battery power. The keys each include an ignition key device embedded within for communicating with the PEPS controller . The transponder of the ignition key device is adapted to send the key number and encrypted data on the signal KEY ID as an RF signal to the PEPS controller . To gain access or entry into the vehicle with the keys in the PEPS implementation the driver may need to wake up the PEPS controller to establish bi directional communication between the keys and the PEPS controller . In one example such a wake up may occur by requiring the driver to touch and or pull the door handle of the vehicle. In response to the door handle being toggled or touched the PEPS controller may wake up and transmit RF based signals to the keys . The PEPS controller and the keys may undergo a series of communications back and forth to each other e.g. handshaking for vehicle access authentication purposes. The PEPS controller may unlock the doors in response to a successful completion of the handshaking process. Once the driver is in the vehicle the driver may simply press a button positioned on an instrument panel to start the vehicle.

Prior to starting the vehicle the key serial number and the encrypted data are compared to known key numbers and or encrypted data in a PEPS look up table in a manner similar to that described in connection with . The manufacturing code is also checked to ensure the key is used for a particular manufacturer of the vehicle. The PEPS LUT may be similar to the PATS LUT as shown in Table 1. As noted above additional operations are performed as exhibited with the handshaking exercise in addition to matching the data received on the signal KEY ID with the data in the LUT e.g. key serial number and encryption data to ensure that the user is properly authorized to enter the vehicle and to start the vehicle with the PEPS implementation. As noted above in connection with all of the keys are generally assigned a primary key status when the vehicle is built and while the vehicle is in transit from the manufacturing plant to the dealer. Such a condition will be reflected under the TYPE heading as shown in Table 1. The status of the key will change from primary to secondary in response to the user programming a particular key via the vehicle interface display . As further noted above the PEPS controller ascertains the key status or driver status of the key e.g. whether primary or secondary by decoding the key number and or encrypted data received on the signal KEY ID and looking up the corresponding key type e.g. primary or secondary under the TYPE heading of the LUT. The PEPS controller is configured to transmit the signal KEY STATUS on the multiplexed bus to the vehicle interface display . The PEPS controller and or the vehicle interface display may transmit the signal KEY STATUS to any controller or module in the vehicle so that the functionality or operation performed by a particular controller or module may be selectively controlled based on the driver status.

The PEPS controller may also transmit the signal IGN SW STS to the cluster . The PEPS controller determines that the key ignition status is in the run position in response to the driver toggling the brake pedal and depressing the start switch. The driver may designate or program a particular key as a secondary key. In such a case the vehicle interface display may prompt the driver to place the key on the backup slot to program that particular key so that the driver knows which key is being programmed as a secondary key. Such a condition takes into account that the driver may have two or more keys in the vehicle while programming a key as a secondary key. The vehicle interface display may send a command signal SEARCH BS to the PEPS controller to determine whether the user placed the key on the back up slot . It is generally contemplated that a key used to first gain access to the vehicle or to authenticate starting the vehicle may not be necessarily the key that is placed on the backup slot . For example another or additional key e.g. key not used to gain entry into the vehicle or start the vehicle may be placed on the back up slot for programming. In such an example the additional key may transmit the signal KEY ID prior to programming to the PEPS controller while on the back up slot .

The PEPS controller transmits a signal STATUS BS to the vehicle interface display . The signal STATUS BS generally corresponds to whether the user has placed the particular key that is to be programmed as a secondary driver on the backup slot . It is generally contemplated that the backup slot may be coupled directly to the vehicle interface display instead of the PEPS controller . The PEPS controller may transmit the signals IGN SW STS STATUS BS and KEY STATUS over the multiplexed bus to the vehicle interface display . The operation of placing the key that is desired to be programmed on the backup slot as a secondary key is optional. Other such implementations may instead program the key that was used to unlock the vehicle and start the engine of the vehicle.

In general the PEPS controller may update the value under the TYPE heading of Table 1 for a particular key from a primary to secondary key in response to the user programming the key as a secondary key via the vehicle interface display and or the user placing the key that is desired to be programmed on the backup slot . The operation of changing the status of the key from a primary key to a secondary key will be discussed in more detail in connection with .

The driver may optionally clear all keys that were designated as secondary keys via the vehicle interface display . In such a case the driver may select the corresponding menus via the vehicle interface display to clear all keys that were programmed as secondary keys. The vehicle interface display transmits the signal CLEAR to control the PEPS controller to clear or change the secondary keys to primary keys. The PEPS controller may transmit the signal CLEAR STATUS to the vehicle interface display to notify the vehicle interface display that the keys programmed as secondary keys have been changed to primary keys. The PEPS controller transmits a signal PRIKEYS and SECKEYS to the vehicle interface display which are indicative of the number of primary keys in the LUT and the number of secondary keys in the LUT respectively. The PEPS controller transmits the signals PRIKEYS and SECKEYS in response to control signals not shown by the vehicle interface display . It is generally contemplated that the signals KEY STATUS PRIKEYS and SECKEYS as well as the signal CLEAR STATUS may be transmitted as one or more messages over the multiplexed bus to the vehicle interface display . For example the data on the signals KEY STATUS PRIKEYS SECKEYS and CLEAR STATUS may be transmitted as hexadecimal based data within a signal message over the multiplexed data bus. Likewise the vehicle interface display may transmit the data on the signal CHANGE REQ and CLEAR as hexadecimal based data within a single message over the multiplexed data bus.

Upon reaching and selecting menu the primary driver is directed to the create secondary key menu to program the key as a secondary key. With the PATS implementation the primary driver selects the hold reset to confirm secondary key menu via the switch . At that point the vehicle interface display displays the secondary key enabled next key cycle status e.g. the secondary key will be active on the next key cycle and the label secondary key status to confirm that the key has been designated as a secondary key e.g. key designation is changed in the LUT of the PATS controller to reflect that the key is a secondary key .

With the PEPS implementation a search backup slot operation is performed to determine whether the key that is to be programmed is on the backup slot . In the event the key is detected to be on the backup slot and the key is not already programmed as a secondary key the vehicle interface display displays the secondary key enabled next key cycle status e.g. the secondary key will be active on the next key cycle and the label secondary key status to confirm that the key has been designated as a secondary key e.g. key designation is changed in the LUT of the PEPS controller to reflect that the key is a secondary key .

In the event the key is detected to be already programmed as a secondary key the vehicle interface display displays the key in slot is secondary key status . In the event the key is not detected on the back up slot the vehicle interface display provides the please put key in backup slot prompt . The vehicle interface display exits the create secondary key menu by entering into the setup menu or the information menu .

The clear all secondary key menu includes a hold reset clear secondary key menu and an all secondary key cleared status . In general upon the user selected the hold reset clear secondary key menu the PATS controller or the PEPS controller clears all keys that are designated as secondary keys in the respective LUTs and resets such keys so that the keys are assigned a primary key status. In addition the vehicle interface display resets the total number of miles shown in and to zero to indicate that the secondary keys were changed back to primary keys. Such a condition may indicate to the primary driver that secondary driver may have changed the status of the keys from secondary to primary without the authorization or knowledge of the primary driver. The number of programmed keys is shown in and will change accordingly in response to all of the secondary keys being cleared.
