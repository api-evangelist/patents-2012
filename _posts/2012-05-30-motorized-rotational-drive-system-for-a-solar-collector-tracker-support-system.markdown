The present invention relates to a solar collector tracker support system. It more particularly relates to a tracker system that can be oriented along two axes of rotation a horizontal axis of rotation for a rotation making it possible to track the sun as it rises and lowers and a vertical axis of rotation for a rotation making it possible to track the sun from East to West respectively.

The subject matter of the invention falls within the field of tracker support systems also called solar trackers with two axes in other words that can be oriented in terms of azimuth and elevation.

The invention is applicable in solar trackers with two axes supporting solar collectors in particular of the following types 

In the field of solar trackers with two axes it is known in particular from document WO 2009 147454 to provide a tracker support system comprising a stationary single pillar anchored in the ground and a moving structure including two arms rotated along the vertical axis of rotation using a first motorized gear motor unit positioned at the end of the single pillar. The moving structure also integrates a support platform for the solar collectors that is rotated on the arms along the horizontal axis of rotation using a second motorized gear motor unit.

The rotational driving of the platform along the horizontal axis of rotation requires a horizontal beam fastened on the free ends of the arms and on which at the center thereof the second motorized gear motor unit is fastened. This driving also requires a transmission shaft rotatably mounted in bearings fastened on the ends of the horizontal beam and having ends secured to the platform. The second motorized gear motor unit includes a worm screw in mesh with a crown said crown being passed through by and coupled with the transmission shaft.

Such a driving system has many drawbacks including the use of a particularly heavy and bulky horizontal beam which in addition to increasing the weight of the system makes the assembly of the system more complex. Furthermore the system uses direct driving between the transmission shaft and the plate with the major drawback of requiring a particularly high gear motor torque for the second motorized gear motor group.

The state of the art may also be illustrated by the teaching of document WO 2010 059218 which discloses a system for rotating the platform of the solar tracker using a ring gear sector in mesh with a central pinion. This ring gear sector is placed in the middle of the platform on the vertical axis of rotation with the drawback of providing a structure that is particularly exposed to risks of torsion of the platform along the horizontal axis of rotation under the effect of an imbalance of the wind on the platform such torsion is particularly detrimental to the precision of the tracker.

The present invention aims to resolve all or some of the aforementioned drawbacks by proposing a motorized drive system for a solar collector tracker support system that guarantees reduced sag on the platform and therefore prevents torsion thereof along the horizontal axis of rotation.

Another aim of the invention is to propose a motorized drive system for a tracker support system that makes it possible to lighten the structure of the tracker support system and is quick to assemble and more specifically that makes it possible to decrease the weight of the plate for a same deflected curve.

To that end it proposes a motorized rotational drive system for rotating a framework around an axis of rotation for a solar collector tracker support system said motorized system including 

Thus this motorized system offers a particularly advantageous structure since it makes it possible to work with a reduced gear motor torque due to the coupling between the ring gear sectors and the transmission shaft and to limit the risks of torsion of the second framework by separating the ring gear sectors from each other sufficiently that possible separation between the two ring gear sectors makes it possible to optimize the deflected curves on the framework.

Advantageously the ring gear sectors extend over an angular sector comprised between 90 and 180 preferably greater than 120 to offer a high rotational travel to the framework.

The invention also relates to a solar collector tracker support system that can be oriented along a horizontal axis of rotation and a vertical axis of rotation and comprising a stationary structure for anchoring to the ground and a moving structure including 

In one advantageous configuration of the invention the first framework includes at least two arms secured to each other and extending on either side of the vertical axis of rotation to form a V shaped structure.

This V shaped structure makes it possible to separate the ring gear sectors and thereby optimize the deflected curves on the second framework. In other words with such a V shaped structure it is advantageously possible to decrease the bending on the second framework and thereby lighten the weight of the tracker system.

According to one feature the first framework includes two platens fastened on the respective free ends of the two arms and each having a first bearing and a second bearing in which the transmission shaft and the corresponding ring gear sector are respectively rotatably mounted.

Thus the transmission shaft is rotatably mounted in the first bearings of the platens and the ring gear sectors are rotatably mounted in the second bearings of the corresponding platens these platens guarantee the structural cohesion and mechanical strength of the assembly to limit the risks of torsion of the second framework.

According to another feature the free ends of the transmission shaft protrude past the platens to support the drive pinions coupled with the respective ring gear sectors.

In one particular embodiment the platform of the second framework comprises at least two sidepieces substantially parallel to the horizontal axis of rotation and the ring gear sectors are fastened on crosspieces fastened on the sidepieces of the platform and extending between at least two sidepieces.

Advantageously to avoid torsion of the platform the platform has a predetermined length LO along the horizontal axis of rotation and the separation between the two ring gear sectors along the horizontal axis of rotation is comprised between LO 5 and 4LO 5 and preferably between 2LO 5 and 3LO 5.

The invention also relates to a solar assembly including a tracker support system according to the invention and solar collectors supported by the second framework of the tracker support system.

The following detailed description is done in reference to and pertains to a first tracker support system according to the invention and a second tracker support system according to the invention these tracker support systems being of the type that can be oriented along two axes of rotation a vertical axis of rotation AV and a horizontal axis of rotation AH respectively. The same numerical references will be used to describe the same members and functional and structural elements of the two tracker support systems .

For the first tracker support system the stationary structure is made up of a pylon formed by an assembly of metal profiles and having feet topped by a mast. In the second tracker support system the stationary structure is made up of a pedestal or base made in the form of a ring gear with outer teeth. It is also possible to consider providing a stationary structure made in the form of a pylon or a tubular mast.

This tracker support system also comprises anchoring members for anchoring the stationary structure in the ground. These anchoring members are of the screw pile rod or peg type and are thus designed to penetrate the ground and ensure anchoring of the tracker support system . It is also possible to consider providing for anchoring using concrete studs that ballast the stationary structure .

This tracker support system further comprises a moving structure rotatably mounted on the stationary structure and comprising a first framework rotatably mounted on the stationary structure along the vertical axis of rotation AV.

The first framework includes two arms that are symmetrical relative to the vertical axis of rotation AV for example formed by an assembly of metal profiles these two arms are secured to each other moving away from the vertical axis of rotation AV to form a V shaped structure.

To ensure the rotation of the first framework around the vertical axis of rotation AV the tracker support system comprises a first motorized system. Reference may be made to French patent applications no. 11 011659 and no. 11 62002 filed by the Applicant for additional information on such a first motorized system.

This moving structure also comprises a second framework forming a platform designed to support the solar collectors not shown rotatably mounted on the two arms along the horizontal axis of rotation AH.

It is also possible to consider providing a platform without beams only having several sidepieces side by side. It will be noted that the platform has a length LO along the horizontal axis of rotation AH corresponding to the length of the sidepieces and also a width LA following a direction orthogonal to the horizontal axis of rotation AH corresponding to the length of the beams as illustrated in and in for the first and second tracker support systems respectively.

For the first tracker support system the platform also includes several guy ropes fastened on sidepieces and extending orthogonally to the platform the ends of the guy ropes are connected to the corresponding sidepieces using connectors in particular of the tensioned rope rigid rod or metal profile type.

To rotate the platform around the horizontal axis of rotation AH the tracker support system comprises a motorized drive system including 

More specifically the transmission shaft supports the two drive pinions on both of its ends said drive pinions thus being secured to the transmission shaft.

Furthermore the first framework includes two platens fastened on the respective free ends of the two arms and extending substantially parallel to the ring gear sectors . Each platen has two bearings i.e. 

Thus the rotation of the transmission shaft leads to a synchronized rotation of the two drive pinions which rotate the ring gear sectors and the associated crosspieces still in a synchronized manner so as ultimately to pivot the platform around the horizontal axis of rotation AH.

To limit the risks of torsion of the platform it is advantageous for the separation between the two ring gear sectors along the horizontal axis of rotation AH to be comprised between LO 5 and 4LO 5 and more particularly between 2LO 5 and 3LO 5 where LO corresponds as a reminder to the length of the platform or length of the sidepieces . It should be noted that the separation between the two ring gear sectors corresponds substantially to the length of the transmission shaft .

Of course the example embodiment described above is in no way limiting and other improvements and details may be made to the tracker support system according to the invention without going beyond the scope of the invention where other types of assembly of the frameworks may for example be used.
