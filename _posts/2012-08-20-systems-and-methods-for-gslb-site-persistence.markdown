The present application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. Non provisional application Ser. No. 12 323 285 entitled Systems and Methods For GSLB Site Persistence and filed on Nov. 25 2008 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for maintaining site persistence in a Global Server Load Balancing GSLB system.

A corporate or enterprise may deploy various services across a network to serve clients connecting to the services from many areas. A clients may request to access a service such as a web server provided by the enterprise. The enterprise in order to improve the access to this service may deploy multiple servers at various geographical locations in order to expedite the access and meet the demand of users. Similarly the enterprise may provide a plurality of server farms positioned at a variety of sites and including any number of servers capable of processing the client s request. The enterprise may use a load balancer to manage network traffic across these servers and minimize the network congestion and delays. Similarly the enterprise may also use a plurality of global server load balancer GSLB to manage network traffic over a plurality of such sites each of which includes at least one load balancer managing network traffic locally over the server farm. As requests of clients are received by GSLBs and balanced across multiple sites load balancers at each of the sites may further balance the requests among multiple servers. As the requests traverse multiple load balancers via the GSLB site hierarchy maintaining persistence of a client or client session across the hierarchy is challenging.

The present invention provides systems and methods for maintaining site persistence in a hierarchical Global Server Load Balancing GSLB deployment. Via configuration of GSLB services locally and remotely on each of the GSLB appliances and LB appliances at a site a site appliance identifies and associates requests from the GSLB with the site. Furthermore the site appliance may receive a GSLB cookie with the client request and confirms the request is from the expected GSLB in the site hierarchy. When the load balancers receives a response from a server the appliance may include the GSLB cookie with the response back to the client. The appliance may also include an LB cookie to identify the server selected by the LB. When the client sends another request the request may include the GSLB and LB cookie. With this information the GSLB and LB appliance may maintain site persistence for the client as well as server persistence at the site.

The appliance may use a weight A N and a threshold A N for each of the metrics used in the determination of the load . In one embodiment the appliance establishes a weight and or a threshold . In other embodiments a user establishes a weight and or a threshold . For example in some cases if a user does not specify a weight for a plurality of metrics the appliance equally weights each metric. In one example embodiment the appliance determines the load for each service as follows Sum weight of metric established ceiling value of metric obtained value of metric established ceiling value of metric Sum weights In some embodiments a metric value may be based on a range of 0 100 or absolute range. In other embodiments a metric value may not be based on a range of 0 100 or is otherwise relative to the type of metric and possible range of values. For example a metric identifying a number of connections may have a ceiling or predetermined maximum value of 10 000. In one of these embodiments the appliance establishes a ceiling value or predetermined upper limit for the metric value. In another of these embodiments a user via the configuration interface establishes a ceiling value or predetermined upper limit for the metric value. In further embodiments the established ceiling value may comprise a value less than the actual maximum value for the metric or upper limit of the range value. For example a user may specify or configure a relative range value based on a desired operational or performance range of a metric.

In some embodiments if a metric of a service exceeds a user or appliance provided threshold the service may be excluded from the load determination or otherwise from a load balancing decision. In other embodiments if all the metrics of a service exceeds their corresponding thresholds the service may be excluded from the load determination or otherwise from a load balancing decisions. In yet another embodiment even if a service exceeds the threshold s for one or more of the metrics the service may be considered in the load determination or otherwise for load selection. In some cases a client session may be identified as persistent or sticky to a vServer or service . In these cases if a request for the client s sessions is received by the appliance the appliance may provide the request to a vServer or service although a metric for the vServer or service has been exceeded.

In still other embodiments if a threshold of a metric of a service or virtual server has been exceeded the appliance may in response to the threshold being exceeded redirect the client making the request to another resource. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a server or service such that the client may bypass the appliance and access the server or service directly. In one embodiment the appliance may transmit a URL to the client comprising the address of a second appliance or another device. In still another embodiment the appliance may redirect the client request to a second appliance device service or server on behalf of the client.

In some embodiments if a threshold of a metric of a service or virtual server has been exceeded the appliance may in response to the threshold being exceeded direct a client request to a second virtual server or service. In one embodiment a second virtual server may be a backup to a primary virtual server. Upon detection of the threshold being exceeded the appliance may spillover requests and connections to a second virtual server.

In some embodiments a user configures multiple monitors for a service . In these embodiments the load on the service is a sum of the load of all the monitors. In one embodiment the sum of the load from multiple monitors is weighted. The appliance may assign a monitoring a weight. A weight may comprise an integer decimal or any other numeric indicator. In some embodiments a user may configure via the configuration interface the weight corresponding to a monitor . In some embodiments all monitors may be assigned equal weight. In other embodiments a plurality of monitors may each be assigned different weights. The weights may be assigned to the monitors based on any criteria indicating relative importance including without limitation the appliance or user determination of the relative importance or value of the monitor in view of the service reliability of the monitoring mechanism and the frequency of monitoring.

In one embodiment a monitoring agent may be assigned a weight based on the relative importance of the service monitored by the appliance. For example if most user requests in an environment are HTTP requests a monitoring agent monitoring HTTP availability of a server might be assigned a weight of 10 while a monitoring agent monitoring FTP availability of a server might be assigned a weight of 3. Or for example if an administrator placed a high priority on UDP applications a monitoring agent monitoring UDP availability of a server may be assigned a weight of 20 while a DNS monitoring agent may be assigned a weight of 5.

In some embodiments an appliance may compute a sum of the weights of the monitoring agents currently reporting a network service as operational. For example if five monitoring agents each assigned a weight of 30 are monitoring a network service and three of the five monitoring agents report the network service as available the appliance may determine the sum of the monitoring agents currently reporting the network service as operational to be 90. Or for example if only two monitoring agents one with a weight of 20 and the other with a weight of 40 are reporting a server as available the appliance may compute the sum of the monitoring agents currently reporting a server as operational to be 60.
