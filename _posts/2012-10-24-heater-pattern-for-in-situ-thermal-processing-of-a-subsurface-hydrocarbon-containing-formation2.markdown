title: Heater pattern for in situ thermal processing of a subsurface hydrocarbon containing formation
abstract: Embodiments of the present invention relate to heater patterns and related methods of producing hydrocarbon fluids from a subsurface hydrocarbon-containing formation (for example, an oil shale formation) where a heater cell may be divided into nested inner and outer zones. Production wells may be located within one or both zones. In the smaller inner zone, heaters may be arranged at a relatively high spatial density while in the larger surrounding outer zone, a heater spatial density may be significantly lower. Due to the higher heater density, a rate of temperature increase in the smaller inner zone of the subsurface exceeds that of the larger outer zone, and a rate of hydrocarbon fluid production ramps up faster in the inner zone than in the outer zone. In some embodiments, a ratio between a half-maximum sustained production time and a half-maximum rise time of a hydrocarbon fluid production function is relatively large.

The present invention relates to methods and systems of heating a subsurface formation for example in order to produce hydrocarbon fluids therefrom.

Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources as feedstocks and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery processing and or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations that were previously inaccessible and or too expensive to extract using available methods. Chemical and or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation and or increase the value of the hydrocarbon material. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids composition changes solubility changes density changes phase changes and or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation.

Large deposits of heavy hydrocarbons heavy oil and or tar contained in relatively permeable formations for example in tar sands are found in North America South America Africa and Asia. Tar can be surface mined and upgraded to lighter hydrocarbons such as crude oil naphtha kerosene and or gas oil. Surface milling processes may further separate the bitumen from sand. The separated bitumen may be converted to light hydrocarbons using conventional refinery methods. Mining and upgrading tar sand is usually substantially more expensive than producing lighter hydrocarbons from conventional oil reservoirs.

Retorting processes for oil shale may be generally divided into two major types aboveground surface and underground in situ . Aboveground retorting of oil shale typically involves mining and construction of metal vessels capable of withstanding high temperatures. The quality of oil produced from such retorting may typically be poor thereby requiring costly upgrading. Aboveground retorting may also adversely affect environmental and water resources due to mining transporting processing and or disposing of the retorted material. Many U.S. patents have been issued relating to aboveground retorting of oil shale. Currently available aboveground retorting processes include for example direct indirect and or combination heating methods.

In situ retorting typically involves retorting oil shale without removing the oil shale from the ground by mining modified in situ processes typically require some mining to develop underground retort chambers. An example of a modified in situ process includes a method developed by Occidental Petroleum that involves mining approximately 20 of the oil shale in a formation explosively rubblizing the remainder of the oil shale to fill up the mined out area and combusting the oil shale by gravity stable combustion in which combustion is initiated from the top of the retort. Other examples of modified in situ processes include the Rubble In Situ Extraction RISE method developed by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory LLL and radio frequency methods developed by IIT Research Institute IITRI and LLL which involve tunneling and mining drifts to install an array of radio frequency antennas in an oil shale formation.

Obtaining permeability in an oil shale formation between injection and production wells tends to be difficult because oil shale is often substantially impermeable. Drilling such wells may be expensive and time consuming. Many methods have attempted to link injection and production wells.

Many different types of wells or wellbores may be used to treat the hydrocarbon containing formation using an in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments vertical and or substantially vertical wells are used to treat the formation. In some embodiments horizontal or substantially horizontal wells such as J shaped wells and or L shaped wells and or U shaped wells are used to treat the formation. In some embodiments combinations of horizontal wells vertical wells and or other combinations are used to treat the formation. In certain embodiments wells extend through the overburden of the formation to a hydrocarbon containing layer of the formation. In some situations heat in the wells is lost to the overburden. In some situations surface and overburden infrastructures used to support heaters and or production equipment in horizontal wellbores or U shaped wellbores are large in size and or numerous.

Wellbores for heater injection and or production wells may be drilled by rotating a drill bit against the formation. The drill bit may be suspended in a borehole by a drill string that extends to the surface. In some cases the drill bit may be rotated by rotating the drill string at the surface. Sensors may be attached to drilling systems to assist in determining direction operating parameters and or operating conditions during drilling of a wellbore. Using the sensors may decrease the amount of time taken to determine positioning of the drilling systems. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7 093 370 to Hansberry and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009 027041 to Zaeper et al. both of which are incorporated herein by reference describe a borehole navigation systems and or sensors to drill wellbores in hydrocarbon formations. At present however there are still many hydrocarbon containing formations where drilling wellbores is difficult expensive and or time consuming.

Heaters may be placed in wellbores to heat a formation during an in situ process. There are many different types of heaters which may be used to heat the formation. Examples of in situ processes utilizing downhole heaters are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 2 634 961 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 732 195 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 780 450 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 789 805 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 2 923 535 to Ljungstrom U.S. Pat. No. 4 886 118 to Van Meurs et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 688 387 to Wellington et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 575 052 to Sandberg et al. and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0135254 to Vinegar et al. each of which are incorporated herein by reference describe an in situ heat treatment process that utilizes a circulation system to heat one or more treatment areas. The circulation system may use a heated liquid heat transfer fluid that passes through piping in the formation to transfer heat to the formation.

US Patent Application Publication No. 2009 0095476 to Nguyen et al. which is incorporated herein by reference describes a heating system for a subsurface formation that includes a conduit located in an opening in the subsurface formation. An insulated conductor is located in the conduit. A material is in the conduit between a portion of the insulated conductor and a portion of the conduit. The material may be a salt. The material is a fluid at the operating temperature of the heating system. Heat transfers from the insulated conductor to the fluid from the fluid to the conduit and from the conduit to the subsurface formation.

In situ production of hydrocarbons from tar sand may be accomplished by heating and or injecting fluids into the formation. U.S. Pat. No. 4 084 637 to Todd U.S. Pat. No. 4 926 941 to Glandt et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 046 559 to Glandt and U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 726 to Glandt each of which are incorporated herein by reference describe methods of producing viscous materials from subterranean formations that includes passing electrical current through the subterranean formation. Steam may be injected from the injector well into the formation to produce hydrocarbons.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 930 574 to Jager which is incorporated herein by reference describes a method for tertiary oil recovery and gas utilization by the introduction of nuclear heated steam into an oil field and the removal separation and preparation of an escaping oil gas water mixture.

US Patent Application Publication 20100270015 to Vinegar et al. discloses that an oil shale formation may be treated using an in situ thermal process. A mixture of hydrocarbons H and or other formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Heat may be applied to the formation to raise a temperature of a portion of the formation to a pyrolysis temperature. Heat sources may be used to heat the formation. The heat sources may be positioned within the formation in a selected pattern.

US Patent Application Publication No. 20090200031 to Miller et al. which is incorporated herein by reference discloses a method for treating a hydrocarbon containing formation includes providing heat input to a first section of the formation from one or more heat sources located in the first section. Fluids are produced from the first section through a production well located at or near the center of the first section. The heat sources are configured such that the average heat input per volume of formation in the first section increases with distance from the production well.

As discussed above there has been a significant amount of effort to develop methods and systems to economically produce hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from hydrocarbon containing formations. At present however there are still many hydrocarbon containing formations from which hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products cannot be economically produced. Thus there is a need for improved methods and systems for heating of a hydrocarbon formation and production of fluids from the hydrocarbon formation. There is also a need for improved methods and systems that reduce energy costs for treating the formation reduce emissions from the treatment process facilitate heating system installation and or reduce heat loss to the overburden as compared to hydrocarbon recovery processes that utilize surface based equipment.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to heater patterns and related methods of producing hydrocarbon fluids from a subsurface hydrocarbon containing formation for example an oil shale formation where a heater cell may be divided into nested inner and outer zones. Production wells may be located within both zones. In the smaller inner zone heaters are arranged at a relatively high spatial density while in the larger surrounding outer zone a heater spatial density is significantly lower. Due to the higher heater density a rate of temperature increase in the smaller inner zone of the subsurface exceeds that of the larger outer zone and a rate of hydrocarbon fluid production ramps up significantly faster in the inner zone than in the outer zone.

The overall density of heaters in the heater cell considered as a whole is significantly less than that within the inner zone. Thus the number of heaters required for the heater pattern is substantially less than what would be required if the heater density throughout the heater cell was that within the inner zone.

Thermal energy from the inner zone may migrate outwardly to the outer zone so as to accelerate hydrocarbon fluid production in the outer zone. Despite the significantly lower heater density in the outer zone a rate of hydrocarbon fluid production in the outer zone may ramp up fast enough so that the overall rate of hydrocarbon fluid production for the heater cell as a whole is substantially sustained over an extended period of time once the inner zone production rate has peaked.

As such the heater patterns disclosed herein provide the minimal or nearly the minimal rise time to a substantially sustained production rate that is possible for a given number of heaters. Alternatively it may be said that the heater patterns disclosed herein minimize or nearly minimize the number of heaters required to achieve a relatively fast rise time with a sustained production level.

In some embodiments a heater spacing within the outer zone is about twice that of the inner zone and or a heater density within the inner zone is about three times that of the outer zone and or an average distance in the inner zone to a nearest heater is about 2 3 times that within the outer zone. In some embodiments an area of a region enclosed by a perimeter of the outer zone is between two and seven e.g. at least two or at least three and or at most seven or at most six or at most five times for example about four times that enclosed by a perimeter of the inner zone.

In some embodiments the inner zone outer zone or both are shaped as a regular hexagon. This shape may be particularly useful when heater cells are arranged on a two dimensional lattice so as to fill a two dimensional portion of the subsurface while eliminating or substantially minimizing the size of the interstitial space between neighboring heater cells. As such a number of heater cells may entirely or almost entirely cover a portion of the sub surface.

Some embodiments of the present invention relate to two level heater patterns where an inner zone of heaters at a higher density is nested within an outer zone of heaters at a lower density. This concept may be generalized to N level heater patterns where one or more outer zones of heaters surround a relatively heater dense inner zone of heaters. In one example N 2. In another example N 3. In yet another example N 4.

For each pair of heater zones the more outer heater zone is larger than the more inner heater zone. Although the heater density in the more outer heater zone is significantly less than that in the more inner zone and although the hydrocarbon fluid production peak in the inner zone occurs at a significantly earlier time than in the more outer zone sufficient thermal energy is delivered to the more outer zone so once the production rate in the more inner zone ramps up quickly this rate may be substantially sustained for a relatively extended period of time by hydrocarbon fluid production rate in the more outer zone.

In some embodiments further performance improvements may be achieved by i concentrating electrical heaters in the denser inner zone while the heaters of the outer zone are primarily molten salt heaters and or ii significantly reducing a power output of the inner zone heater after an inner zone hydrocarbon fluid production rate has dropped e.g. by a first minimal threshold fraction from a maximum level and or iii substantially shutting off one or more inner zone production wells after the inner zone hydrocarbon fluid production rate has dropped e.g. by a second minimal threshold fraction equal to or differing from the first minimal threshold fraction from a maximum level and or iv injecting heat transfer fluid into the inner zone e.g. via inner zone production well s and or via inner zone injection well s so as to accelerate the outwardly migration of thermal energy from the inner zone to the outer zone for example by supplementing outwardly directed diffusive heater transfer with outwardly directed convective heat transfer.

In some embodiments the heater for the zone with the largest well spacing is a molten salt heater due to its operational reliability and energy efficiency.

For convenience in the context of the description herein various terms are presented here. To the extent that definitions are provided explicitly or implicitly here or elsewhere in this application such definitions are understood to be consistent with the usage of the defined terms by those of skill in the pertinent art s . Furthermore such definitions are to be construed in the broadest possible sense consistent with such usage.

The following description generally relates to systems and methods for treating hydrocarbons in the formations. Such formations may be treated to yield hydrocarbon products hydrogen and other products.

Unless specified otherwise for the present disclosure when two quantities QUANTand QUANT are about equal to each other or substantially equal to each other the quantities are either exactly equal or a quantity ratio between i the greater of the two quantities MAX QUANT QUANT and ii the lesser of the two quantities MIN QUANT QUANT is at most 1.3. In some embodiments this ratio is at most 1.2 or at most 1.1 or at most 1.05. In the present disclosure about equal and substantially equal are used interchangeably and have the same meaning.

An about tolerance parameter governs an upper bound of the maximum permissible deviation between two quantities that are about equal. The about tolerance parameter is defined as the difference between the quantity ratio defined in the previous paragraph and 1. Thus unless otherwise specified a value of the about tolerance parameter is 0.3 i.e. the quantity ratio of the previous paragraph is at most 1.3. In some embodiments the about tolerance parameter is 0.2 i.e. the quantity ratio of the previous paragraph is at most 1.2 or 0.1 or 0.05. It is noted that the about tolerance parameter is a global parameter when the about tolerance parameter is X then all quantities that are about or substantially equal to each other have a quantity ratio of about 1 X.

Unless specified otherwise if heaters or heater wells are arranged around a centroid of a candidate region e.g. an inner or outer or outer zone surrounding OZS additional zone then for every reference ray orientation i.e. orientation of a ray from an origin heaters i.e. centroids thereof in a cross section of the subsurface formation in which a heater pattern is defined are present within all four quadrants i.e. 90 degree sector of the candidate region where the origin is defined by the centroid of the candidate region. In some embodiments heaters are present for every reference ray orientation within every 72 degree sector or on every 60 degree sector or on every 45 sector of the candidate region. 

If heaters or heater wells are arranged around a perimeter of a candidate region then they are arranged around the centroid of the candidate region and on a perimeter thereof.

In the context of reduced heat output heating systems apparatus and methods the term automatically means such systems apparatus and methods function in a certain way without the use of external control for example external controllers such as a controller with a temperature sensor and a feedback loop PID controller or predictive controller .

A centroid of an object or region refers to the arithmetic mean of all points within the object or region. Unless specified otherwise the object or region for which a centroid is specified or computed actually refers to a two dimensional cross section of an object or region e.g. a region of the subsurface formation . A centroid of a heater or of a heater well is a centroid of its cross section of the heater or the heater well i.e. at a specific location. Unless specified otherwise this cross section is in the plane in which a heater pattern i.e. for heaters and or heater wells is defined.

For the present disclosure a fluid advection based heater or advection based heater operates by circulating a hot heat transfer fluid within the subsurface or conduits e.g. pipes therein where a rate at which thermal energy is transferred from the heater to the subsurface is governed by heat advection i.e. force convection from the i circulating hot heat transfer fluids to the ii conduits e.g. pipes through which the hot gas flows. Thermal energy of the heated conduits may be subsequently transferred from the conduits e.g. pipes to the subsurface by radiation and or heat conduction and or any other combination of heat transfer mechanisms.

Examples of hot heat transfer fluid include but are not limited to hot gases e.g. flue gas or steam or any other hot gas and hot liquids e.g. molten salt molten metal or synthetic oil . If the hot heat transfer fluid is other than molten salt then the heater is an example of other than a molten salt heater. Molten salt heaters operate by circulating molten salt within the subsurface or a conduit s therein and other than molten salt heaters do not rely on molten salt circulation.

An object or region is convex if for every pair of points within the region or object every point on the straight line segment that joins them is also within the region or object. A closed curve e.g. a perimeter of a two dimensional region is convex if the area enclosed by the closed curve is convex.

A heater cross section may vary along its central axis. Unless specified otherwise a heater cross section is the cross section in the plane in which a heater pattern is defined. Unless specified otherwise for a given heater pattern the cross sections of each of the heaters are all co planar.

A distance between a location and a heater is the distance between the location and a centroid of the heater i.e. a centroid of the heater cross section in the plane in which a heater pattern is defined . The distance between multiple heaters is the distance between their centroids.

A formation includes one or more hydrocarbon containing layers one or more non hydrocarbon layers an overburden and or an underburden. Hydrocarbon layers refer to layers in the formation that contain hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon layers may contain non hydrocarbon material and hydrocarbon material. The overburden and or the underburden include one or more different types of impermeable materials. For example the overburden and or underburden may include rock shale mudstone or wet tight carbonate. In some embodiments of in situ heat treatment processes the overburden and or the underburden may include a hydrocarbon containing layer or hydrocarbon containing layers that are relatively impermeable and are not subjected to temperatures during in situ heat treatment processing that result in significant characteristic changes of the hydrocarbon containing layers of the overburden and or the underburden. For example the underburden may contain shale or mudstone but the underburden is not allowed to heat to pyrolysis temperatures during the in situ heat treatment process. In some cases the overburden and or the underburden may be somewhat permeable.

 Formation fluids refer to fluids present in a formation and may include pyrolyzation fluid synthesis gas mobilized hydrocarbons and water steam . Formation fluids may include hydrocarbon fluids as well as non hydrocarbon fluids. The term mobilized fluid refers to fluids in a hydrocarbon containing formation that are able to flow as a result of thermal treatment of the formation. Produced fluids refer to fluids removed from the subsurface formation.

A heat source is any system for providing heat to at least a portion of a formation substantially by conductive and or radiative heat transfer. For example a heat source may include electric heaters such as an insulated conductor an elongated member and or a conductor disposed in a conduit. A heat source may also include systems that generate heat by burning a fuel external to or in a formation. The systems may be surface burners downhole gas burners flameless distributed combustors and natural distributed combustors. In some embodiments heat provided to or generated in one or more heat sources may be supplied by other sources of energy. The other sources of energy may directly heat a formation or the energy may be applied to a transfer medium that directly or indirectly heats the formation. It is to be understood that one or more heat sources that are applying heat to a formation may use different sources of energy. Thus for example for a given formation some heat sources may supply heat from electric resistance heaters some heat sources may provide heat from combustion and some heat sources may provide heat from one or more other energy sources for example chemical reactions solar energy wind energy biomass or other sources of renewable energy . A chemical reaction may include an exothermic reaction for example an oxidation reaction . A heat source may also include a heater that provides heat to a zone proximate and or surrounding a heating location such as a heater well.

A heater is any system or heat source for generating heat in a well or a near wellbore region. Heaters may be but are not limited to electric heaters burners e.g. gas burners pipes through which hot heat transfer fluid e.g. molten salt or molten metal flows combustors that react with material in or produced from a formation and or combinations thereof. Unless specified otherwise a heater includes elongate portion having a length that is much greater than cross section dimensions. One example of a heater is a molten salt heater which heat the subsurface formation primarily by heat convection between molten salt flowing therein and the subsurface formation. As discussed above and as appreciated by the skilled artisan the aforementioned heat convection does not need to be directly between the flowing molten salt and the subsurface. Instead an indirect heat transfer process that relies upon heat convection may be also be considered an example of the subsurface formation primarily by heat convection between molten salt flowing therein and the subsurface formation. 

 Heavy hydrocarbons are viscous hydrocarbon fluids. Heavy hydrocarbons may include highly viscous hydrocarbon fluids such as heavy oil tar and or asphalt. Heavy hydrocarbons may include carbon and hydrogen as well as smaller concentrations of sulfur oxygen and nitrogen. Additional elements may also be present in heavy hydrocarbons in trace amounts. Heavy hydrocarbons may be classified by API gravity. Heavy hydrocarbons generally have an API gravity below about 20 . Heavy oil for example generally has an API gravity of about 10 20 whereas tar generally has an API gravity below about 10 . The viscosity of heavy hydrocarbons is generally greater than about 100 centipoise at 15 C. Heavy hydrocarbons may include aromatics or other complex ring hydrocarbons.

 Hydrocarbons are generally defined as molecules formed primarily by carbon and hydrogen atoms. Hydrocarbons may also include other elements such as but not limited to halogens metallic elements nitrogen oxygen and or sulfur. Hydrocarbons may be but are not limited to kerogen bitumen pyrobitumen oils natural mineral waxes and asphaltites. Hydrocarbons may be located in or adjacent to mineral matrices in the earth. Matrices may include but are not limited to sedimentary rock sands silicilytes carbonates diatomites and other porous media. Hydrocarbon fluids are fluids that include hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon fluids may include entrain or be entrained in non hydrocarbon fluids such as hydrogen nitrogen carbon monoxide carbon dioxide hydrogen sulfide water and ammonia.

An in situ conversion process refers to a process of heating a hydrocarbon containing formation from heat sources to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the formation above a pyrolysis temperature so that pyrolyzation fluid is produced in the formation.

An in situ heat treatment process refers to a process of heating a hydrocarbon containing formation with heat sources to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the formation above a temperature that results in mobilized fluid visbreaking and or pyrolysis of hydrocarbon containing material so that mobilized fluids visbroken fluids and or pyrolyzation fluids are produced in the formation.

For the present disclosure an isoperimeteric quotient of a closed curve e.g. polygon is a ratio between i the product of 4n and an area closed by the closed curve and ii the square of the perimeter of the closed curve.

 Kerogen is a solid insoluble hydrocarbon that has been converted by natural degradation and that principally contains carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and sulfur. Coal and oil shale are typical examples of materials that contain kerogen. Bitumen is a non crystalline solid or viscous hydrocarbon material that is substantially soluble in carbon disulfide. Oil is a fluid containing a mixture of condensable hydrocarbons.

When an inner zone heater or a point on inner zone perimeter is located away from a perimeter of an outer zone this means that the located away inner zone heater or the located away inner zone perimeter point is displaced from the outer zone perimeter by at least a threshold distance. Unless otherwise specified this threshold difference is at least one half of an inner zone average heater spacing.

 Production of a hydrocarbon fluid refers to thermally generating the hydrocarbon fluid e.g. from kerogen or bitumen and removing the fluid from the sub surface formation via a production well.

 Pyrolysis is the breaking of chemical bonds due to the application of heat. For example pyrolysis may include transforming a compound into one or more other substances by heat alone. Heat may be transferred to a section of the formation to cause pyrolysis.

 Pyrolyzation fluids or pyrolysis products refers to fluid produced substantially during pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. Fluid produced by pyrolysis reactions may mix with other fluids in a formation. The mixture would be considered pyrolyzation fluid or pyrolyzation product. As used herein pyrolysis zone refers to a volume of a formation for example a relatively permeable formation such as a tar sands formation that is reacted or reacting to form a pyrolyzation fluid.

Unless specified otherwise when a first quantity QUANT significantly exceeds a second quantity QUANT a ratio between i the greater of the two quantities MAX QUANT QUANT and ii the lesser of the two quantities MIN QUANT QUANT is at least 1.5. In some embodiments this ratio is at least 1.7 or at least 1.9.

Unless specified otherwise a significant majority refers to at least 75 . In some embodiments the significant majority may be at least 80 or at least 85 or at least 90 .

 Superposition of heat refers to providing heat from two or more heat sources to a selected section of a formation such that the temperature of the formation at least at one location between the heat sources is influenced by the heat sources.

 Tar is a viscous hydrocarbon that generally has a viscosity greater than about 10 000 centipoise at 15 C. The specific gravity of tar generally is greater than 1.000. Tar may have an API gravity less than 10 .

A tar sands formation is a formation in which hydrocarbons are predominantly present in the form of heavy hydrocarbons and or tar entrained in a mineral grain framework or other host lithology for example sand or carbonate . Examples of tar sands formations include formations such as the Athabasca formation the Grosmont formation and the Peace River formation all three in Alberta Canada and the Faja a formation in the Orinoco belt in Venezuela.

 Thermally conductive fluid includes fluid that has a higher thermal conductivity than air at standard temperature and pressure STP 0 and 101.325 kPa .

 Thermal conductivity is a property of a material that describes the rate at which heat flows in steady state between two surfaces of the material for a given temperature difference between the two surfaces.

 Thickness of a layer refers to the thickness of a cross section of the layer wherein the cross section is normal to a face of the layer.

A U shaped wellbore refers to a wellbore that extends from a first opening in the formation through at least a portion of the formation and out through a second opening in the formation. In this context the wellbore may be only roughly in the shape of a V or U with the understanding that the legs of the U do not need to be parallel to each other or perpendicular to the bottom of the U for the wellbore to be considered U shaped .

 Upgrade refers to increasing the quality of hydrocarbons. For example upgrading heavy hydrocarbons may result in an increase in the API gravity of the heavy hydrocarbons.

 Visbreaking refers to the untangling of molecules in fluid during heat treatment and or to the breaking of large molecules into smaller molecules during heat treatment which results in a reduction of the viscosity of the fluid.

 Viscosity refers to kinematic viscosity at 40 unless otherwise specified. Viscosity is as determined by ASTM Method D445.

 VGO or vacuum gas oil refers to hydrocarbons with a boiling range distribution between 343 and 538 at 0.101 MPa. VGO content is determined by ASTM Method D5307.

The term wellbore refers to a hole in a formation made by drilling or insertion of a conduit into the formation. A wellbore may have a substantially circular cross section or another cross sectional shape. As used herein the terms well and opening when referring to an opening in the formation may be used interchangeably with the term wellbore. 

A formation may be treated in various ways to produce many different products. Different stages or processes may be used to treat the formation during an in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments one or more sections of the formation are solution mined to remove soluble minerals from the sections. Solution mining minerals may be performed before during and or after the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments the average temperature of one or more sections being solution mined may be maintained below about 120 C.

In some embodiments one or more sections of the formation are heated to remove water from the sections and or to remove methane and other volatile hydrocarbons from the sections. In some embodiments the average temperature may be raised from ambient temperature to temperatures below about 220 during removal of water and volatile hydrocarbons.

In some embodiments one or more sections of the formation are heated to temperatures that allow for movement and or visbreaking of hydrocarbons in the formation. In some embodiments the average temperature of one or more sections of the formation are raised to mobilization temperatures of hydrocarbons in the sections for example to temperatures ranging from 100 to 250 from 120 to 240 or from 150 to 230 .

In some embodiments one or more sections are heated to temperatures that allow for pyrolysis reactions in the formation. In some embodiments the average temperature of one or more sections of the formation may be raised to pyrolysis temperatures of hydrocarbons in the sections for example temperatures ranging from 230 to 900 from 240 to 400 or from 250 to 350 .

Heating the hydrocarbon containing formation with a plurality of heat sources may establish thermal gradients around the heat sources that raise the temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation to desired temperatures at desired heating rates. The rate of temperature increase through mobilization temperature range and or pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may affect the quality and quantity of the formation fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the mobilization temperature range and or pyrolysis temperature range may allow for the production of high quality high API gravity hydrocarbons from the formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the mobilization temperature range and or pyrolysis temperature range may allow for the removal of a large amount of the hydrocarbons present in the formation as hydrocarbon product.

In some in situ heat treatment embodiments a portion of the formation is heated to a desired temperature instead of slowly heating the temperature through a temperature range. In some embodiments the desired temperature is 300 325 or 350 Other temperatures may be selected as the desired temperature.

Superposition of heat from heat sources allows the desired temperature to be relatively quickly and efficiently established in the formation. Energy input into the formation from the heat sources may be adjusted to maintain the temperature in the formation substantially at a desired temperature.

Mobilization and or pyrolysis products may be produced from the formation through production wells. In some embodiments the average temperature of one or more sections is raised to mobilization temperatures and hydrocarbons are produced from the production wells. The average temperature of one or more of the sections may be raised to pyrolysis temperatures after production due to mobilization decreases below a selected value. In some embodiments the average temperature of one or more sections may be raised to pyrolysis temperatures without significant production before reaching pyrolysis temperatures. Formation fluids including pyrolysis products may be produced through the production wells.

In some embodiments the average temperature of one or more sections may be raised to temperatures sufficient to allow synthesis gas production after mobilization and or pyrolysis. In some embodiments hydrocarbons may be raised to temperatures sufficient to allow synthesis gas production without significant production before reaching the temperatures sufficient to allow synthesis gas production. For example synthesis gas may be produced in a temperature range from about 400 to about 1200 about 500 to about 1100 or about 550 to about 1000 A synthesis gas generating fluid for example steam and or water may be introduced into the sections to generate synthesis gas. Synthesis gas may be produced from production wells.

Solution mining removal of volatile hydrocarbons and water mobilizing hydrocarbons pyrolyzing hydrocarbons generating synthesis gas and or other processes may be performed during the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments some processes may be performed after the in situ heat treatment process. Such processes may include but are not limited to recovering heat from treated sections storing fluids for example water and or hydrocarbons in previously treated sections and or sequestering carbon dioxide in previously treated sections.

Heat sources are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources may include heaters such as insulated conductors conductor in conduit heaters surface burners flameless distributed combustors and or natural distributed combustors. Heat sources may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to heat hydrocarbons in the formation. Energy may be supplied to heat sources through supply lines . Supply lines may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or heat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters may transport fuel for combustors or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation. In some embodiments electricity for an in situ heat treatment process may be provided by a nuclear power plant or nuclear power plants. The use of nuclear power may allow for reduction or elimination of carbon dioxide emissions from the in situ heat treatment process.

When the formation is heated the heat input into the formation may cause expansion of the formation and geomechanical motion. The heat sources may be turned on before at the same time or during a dewatering process. Computer simulations may model formation response to heating. The computer simulations may be used to develop a pattern and time sequence for activating heat sources in the formation so that geomechanical motion of the formation does not adversely affect the functionality of heat sources production wells and other equipment in the formation.

Heating the formation may cause an increase in permeability and or porosity of the formation. Increases in permeability and or porosity may result from a reduction of mass in the formation due to vaporization and removal of water removal of hydrocarbons and or creation of fractures. Fluid may flow more easily in the heated portion of the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity of the formation. Fluid in the heated portion of the formation may move a considerable distance through the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity. The considerable distance may be over 1000 m depending on various factors such as permeability of the formation properties of the fluid temperature of the formation and pressure gradient allowing movement of the fluid. The ability of fluid to travel considerable distance in the formation allows production wells to be spaced relatively far apart in the formation.

Production wells are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments production well includes a heat source. The heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production well. In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments the amount of heat supplied to the formation from the production well per meter of the production well is less than the amount of heat applied to the formation from a heat source that heats the formation per meter of the heat source. Heat applied to the formation from the production well may increase formation permeability adjacent to the production well by vaporizing and removing liquid phase fluid adjacent to the production well and or by increasing the permeability of the formation adjacent to the production well by formation of macro and or micro fractures.

More than one heat source may be positioned in the production well. A heat source in a lower portion of the production well may be turned off when superposition of heat from adjacent heat sources heats the formation sufficiently to counteract benefits provided by heating the formation with the production well. In some embodiments the heat source in an upper portion of the production well may remain on after the heat source in the lower portion of the production well is deactivated. The heat source in the upper portion of the well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid.

In some embodiments the heat source in production well allows for vapor phase removal of formation fluids from the formation. Providing heating at or through the production well may 1 inhibit condensation and or refluxing of production fluid when such production fluid is moving in the production well proximate the overburden 2 increase heat input into the formation 3 increase production rate from the production well as compared to a production well without a heat source 4 inhibit condensation of high carbon number compounds Chydrocarbons and above in the production well and or 5 increase formation permeability at or proximate the production well.

Subsurface pressure in the formation may correspond to the fluid pressure generated in the formation. As temperatures in the heated portion of the formation increase the pressure in the heated portion may increase as a result of thermal expansion of in situ fluids increased fluid generation and vaporization of water. Controlling rate of fluid removal from the formation may allow for control of pressure in the formation. Pressure in the formation may be determined at a number of different locations such as near or at production wells near or at heat sources or at monitor wells.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations production of hydrocarbons from the formation is inhibited until at least some hydrocarbons in the formation have been mobilized and or pyrolyzed. Formation fluid may be produced from the formation when the formation fluid is of a selected quality. In some embodiments the selected quality includes an API gravity of at least about 20 30 or 40 . Inhibiting production until at least some hydrocarbons are mobilized and or pyrolyzed may increase conversion of heavy hydrocarbons to light hydrocarbons. Inhibiting initial production may minimize the production of heavy hydrocarbons from the formation. Production of substantial amounts of heavy hydrocarbons may require expensive equipment and or reduce the life of production equipment.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations hydrocarbons in the formation may be heated to mobilization and or pyrolysis temperatures before substantial permeability has been generated in the heated portion of the formation. An initial lack of permeability may inhibit the transport of generated fluids to production wells . During initial heating fluid pressure in the formation may increase proximate heat sources . The increased fluid pressure may be released monitored altered and or controlled through one or more heat sources . For example selected heat sources or separate pressure relief wells may include pressure relief valves that allow for removal of some fluid from the formation.

In some embodiments pressure generated by expansion of mobilized fluids pyrolysis fluids or other fluids generated in the formation may be allowed to increase although an open path to production wells or any other pressure sink may not yet exist in the formation. The fluid pressure may be allowed to increase towards a lithostatic pressure. Fractures in the hydrocarbon containing formation may form when the fluid approaches the lithostatic pressure. For example fractures may form from heat sources to production wells in the heated portion of the formation. The generation of fractures in the heated portion may relieve some of the pressure in the portion. Pressure in the formation may have to be maintained below a selected pressure to inhibit unwanted production fracturing of the overburden or underburden and or coking of hydrocarbons in the formation.

After mobilization and or pyrolysis temperatures are reached and production from the formation is allowed pressure in the formation may be varied to alter and or control a composition of formation fluid produced to control a percentage of condensable fluid as compared to non condensable fluid in the formation fluid and or to control an API gravity of formation fluid being produced. For example decreasing pressure may result in production of a larger condensable fluid component. The condensable fluid component may contain a larger percentage of olefins.

In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to promote production of formation fluid with an API gravity of greater than 20 . Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit formation subsidence during in situ heat treatment. Maintaining increased pressure may reduce or eliminate the need to compress formation fluids at the surface to transport the fluids in collection conduits to treatment facilities.

Maintaining increased pressure in a heated portion of the formation may surprisingly allow for production of large quantities of hydrocarbons of increased quality and of relatively low molecular weight. Pressure may be maintained so that formation fluid produced has a minimal amount of compounds above a selected carbon number. The selected carbon number may be at most 25 at most 20 at most 12 or at most 8. Some high carbon number compounds may be entrained in vapor in the formation and may be removed from the formation with the vapor. Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit entrainment of high carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds in the vapor. High carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds may remain in a liquid phase in the formation for significant time periods. The significant time periods may provide sufficient time for the compounds to pyrolyze to form lower carbon number compounds.

Generation of relatively low molecular weight hydrocarbons is believed to be due in part to autogenous generation and reaction of hydrogen in a portion of the hydrocarbon containing formation. For example maintaining an increased pressure may force hydrogen generated during pyrolysis into the liquid phase within the formation. Heating the portion to a temperature in a pyrolysis temperature range may pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the formation to generate liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids. The generated liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids components may include double bonds and or radicals. Hydrogen H in the liquid phase may reduce double bonds of the generated pyrolyzation fluids thereby reducing a potential for polymerization or formation of long chain compounds from the generated pyrolyzation fluids. In addition Hmay also neutralize radicals in the generated pyrolyzation fluids. Hin the liquid phase may inhibit the generated pyrolyzation fluids from reacting with each other and or with other compounds in the formation.

Formation fluid produced from production wells may be transported through collection piping to treatment facilities . Formation fluids may also be produced from heat sources . For example fluid may be produced from heat sources to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources may be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping directly to treatment facilities . Treatment facilities may include separation units reaction units upgrading units fuel cells turbines storage vessels and or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation. In some embodiments the transportation fuel may be jet fuel such as JP 8.

Formation fluid may be hot when produced from the formation through the production wells. Hot formation fluid may be produced during solution mining processes and or during in situ heat treatment processes. In some embodiments electricity may be generated using the heat of the fluid produced from the formation. Also heat recovered from the formation after the in situ process may be used to generate electricity. The generated electricity may be used to supply power to the in situ heat treatment process. For example the electricity may be used to power heaters or to power a refrigeration system for forming or maintaining a low temperature barrier. Electricity may be generated using a Kalina cycle Rankine cycle or other thermodynamic cycle. In some embodiments the working fluid for the cycle used to generate electricity is aqua ammonia.

In the example of heaters are respectively disposed at relatively high and low spatial densities and relatively short and long heater spacings within nested inner and outer zones of the cross section of the hydrocarbon bearing formation. In the particular example of i nineteen inner zone heaters are disposed at a relatively high density and relatively short spacings between neighboring heaters both within an inner zone and around a perimeter of the inner zone i.e. referred to as an inner perimeter and ii twelve outer zone heaters are arranged a relatively low density and relatively long spacings between neighboring heaters in outer zone so as to be distributed around a perimeter of outer zone . In the non limiting example of within outer zone i all outer zone heaters are distributed around the perimeter of outer zone and ii the region between the inner and outer perimeters is relatively free of heaters.

Because heater patterns are defined within a two dimensional cross section of the subsurface formation the terms inner zone and outer zone refer to portions of the two dimensional cross section of the subsurface formation. Because heater patterns are defined within a two dimensional cross section of the subsurface formation various spatial properties related to heater location such as heater spacing density and distance to heater are also defined within a two dimensional planar cross section of the formation.

For the present disclosure the inner zone refers to the entire area enclosed by a perimeter thereof. The outer zone refers to the entire area i outside of inner zone that is ii enclosed by a perimeter outer zone .

As will be discussed below in some embodiments the heater patterns illustrated in the non limiting example of and in other embodiments disclosed herein are useful for minimizing and or substantially minimizing a number of heaters required to rapidly reach a relatively sustained substantially steady state production rate of hydrocarbon fluids in the subsurface formation.

In some embodiments during an initial phase of heater operation the subsurface formation within the smaller inner zone heats up relatively quickly due to the high spatial density and short spacing of heaters therein. This high heater spatial density may expedite production of hydrocarbons within inner zone during an earlier phase of production when the average temperature in the inner zone exceeds e.g. significantly exceeds that of the outer zone . During a later phase of operation the combination of i heat provided by outer zone heaters and ii outward flow of thermal energy from inner zone to outer zone may heat the outer zone .

As will be discussed below see for example in some embodiments two distinct production peaks may be observed an earlier inner zone production peak and a later outer zone production peak . In some embodiments these production peaks collectively contribute to an overall hydrocarbon production rate within the combined region i.e. the combination of inner and outer regions that i ramps up relatively quickly due to the inner zone peak i.e. has a fast rise time and ii is sustained at a near steady rate for an extended period of time.

For the present disclosure inner zone perimeter or inner perimeter which forms a boundary between inner and outer zones is considered part of inner zone . In the example of the twelve heaters located on the inner hexagon are inner zone heaters . The outer zone perimeter or outer perimeter which forms a boundary between the outer zone and external locations outside of the outer zone is considered part of outer zone . The terms inner zone perimeter and inner perimeter are used interchangeably and have the same meaning the terms outer zone perimeter and outer perimeter are used interchangeably and have the same meaning.

As illustrated in inner and outer zones are i nested so that outer zone surrounds inner zone ii share a common centroid location and iii have like shaped perimeters . In the example of inner and outer zone perimeters are both regular hexagons. In the non limiting example of inner zone heaters are dispersed throughout the inner zone at exactly a uniform spacing s. In the example if inner zone heaters are uniformly arranged on an equilateral triangular grid throughout the inner zone a length of each triangle side is s.

Within outer zone an average heater spacing is approximately double that of the inner zone. Along outer perimeter heaters are distanced from each other by 2s. For every pair of adjacent heaters situated on outer perimeter a third heater on inner perimeter is distanced from both heaters of the pair of adjacent heaters by 2s.

In the example of twelve outer zone heaters are uniformly distributed around regular hexagonally shaped outer perimeter so that adjacent heaters on outer perimeter i are separated by a separation distance 2s and ii subtend an angle equal to 30 degrees relative to the center of outer zone.

An area enclosed by inner perimeter i.e. an area of inner zone is equal to 6 square root over 3 swhile an area enclosed by outer perimeter i.e. an area of the combined area that is the sum of inner and outer zones is equal to 24 square root over 3 sor four times the area enclosed by the inner perimeter . An area ratio between areas of the outer and inner zones is three.

The heater spatial density in inner zone significantly exceeds that within outer zone . As will be discussed below with reference to according to a reservoir engineering definition of heater spatial density the density within inner zone of is three times that of outer zone .

For the example of the heater pattern includes a total of 31 heaters. If the heaters were all drilled at the average inner zone spacing a total of 61 heaters would be required. Compared to drilling all of the heaters at an average spacing within inner zone the pattern of requires only about half as many heaters.

In the example of the inner zone and outer zone perimeters are both regularly hexagonally shaped. In some embodiments the shapes of the inner and or outer zone perimeters and consequently the shape of the inner and or outer zones are defined by the locations of the heaters themselves for example the heater locations may define vertex locations for a polygon shaped perimeter.

For example in some embodiments inner zone may be defined by a cluster of heaters in a relatively high spatial density region surrounded by a region where the density of heaters is significantly lower. In these embodiments the edge of this cluster of heaters where an observable density drop may define the border i.e. inner zone perimeter between i the inner zone where heaters are arranged in a cluster at a relatively high density and ii the outer zone .

In some embodiments the perimeter of outer zone may be defined by a ring i.e. not necessarily circularly shaped of heaters outside of inner zone distributed around a centroid of outer zone . This ring may be relatively thin compared to the cluster of heaters that form the inner zone . Overall a local density within this ring of heaters defining outer zone perimeter is relatively high compared to locations adjacent to the ring i.e. locations within outer zone i.e. internal locations within outer zone away from inner zone and outer zone perimeters and outside of outer zone .

Alternatively or additionally the inner and or outer zone perimeters are polygon shaped and are defined such that heaters i.e. a centroid thereof in a cross section of the subsurface where the heater pattern is defined are located at all polygon vertices of perimeters . As noted elsewhere any heater pattern disclosed herein may also be a heater well pattern. As such the perimeters may be defined such that heater well centroids i.e. in a cross section of the subsurface where the heater pattern is defined are located at all polygon vertices of perimeters .

Reference is now made to . As illustrated in heaters are labeled i.e. for the non limiting example of as inner zone heaters or outer zone heaters . In the example of heaters are inner zone heaters and heaters are outer zone heaters . As illustrated in heaters may be labeled i.e. for the non limiting example of as i interior of inner zone heaters located in an interior region of the inner zone away from the inner zone perimeter ii inner perimeter heaters iii interior of outer zone heaters located in an interior region of the inner zone away from the inner zone perimeter and iv outer perimeter heaters . In the example of there are seven interior of inner zone heaters twelve inner perimeter heaters zero interior of outer zone heaters and twelve outer perimeter heaters .

In the example of inner and outer zones are each shaped as a lozenge i.e. a diamond shaped rhombus having opposing 45 degree angles . In the example of and inner and outer zones are each rectangular in shape. In the examples of and inner and outer zones are each shaped like a regular hexagon. The regular hexagon and the lozenge are examples of equi sided polygons i.e. polygons having sides of equal length. In some embodiments a perimeter of inner and or outer zone is shaped like an equi sided polygon.

In one non limiting example related to or to any other embodiment an aspect ratio of inner and or outer zones is relatively large for example at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 50 or at least 100.

One salient feature of the heater location schemes of is that outer zone heaters are predominantly located on or near the outer zone perimeter. In some embodiments this is consistent with the feature of a ring of heaters forming the perimeter of outer zone such that the density within the ring of heaters exceeds that of adjacent locations.

In one example is possible to compare the heater location or layout scheme illustrated in to that illustrated in . Referring to there are seven interior of inner zone heaters twelve inner perimeter heaters four interior of outer zone heaters and twelve outer perimeter heaters . In the example of a ratio between i a number of outer perimeter heaters and ii a number of interior of outer zone heaters is infinite. In the example of this ratio is 3. In different embodiments this ratio may be at least 1.5 or at least 2 or at least 2.5 or at least 3.

In the examples of and production wells are not explicitly illustrated. illustrates one non limiting layout scheme for production wells in a region of a subsurface formation where heaters are arranged according to the schemes of . illustrates an identical layout of heaters and production wells as in however in inner zone production wells are labeled as I while outer zone production wells are labeled as O.

In some embodiments a density of production wells in inner zone significantly exceeds that of outer zone. In the example of the same number of production wells are in each zone however the area of the outer zone is three times that of the inner zone. Using a reservoir engineering definition of density for the example of it is possible to associate heaters with inner zone and heaters with outer zone . In addition three production wells I are within inner zone and associated therein while three production wells I are within outer zone and associated therein. Thus in both inner and outer zones there is a 4 1 ratio between heaters and production wells. In some embodiments for every zone the ratio between heaters and production wells is between two and six.

The heaters and or production wells may also be drilled horizontally or they may be slant drilled or a combination of vertical horizontal and slant drilling. Horizontal drilling may be preferable for a commercial development because of the smaller surface footprint and hence reduced infrastructure expenditures.

In the examples of inner and outer zones have like shaped perimeters share a common centroid location and share a common orientation. In inner and outer zones and their perimeters have different orientations. In the example of inner zone centroid is offset from outer zone centroid . Nevertheless even in the case of the centroid of inner zone is located in a central portion of the region enclosed by outer zone perimeter .

In the examples of inner and outer zones have like shaped perimeters . In contrast in the examples of the shapes of inner and outer zone perimeters are different.

Some features disclosed herein may be defined relative to a characteristic length within inner or outer zones. For the present disclosure a characteristic length within a region of a cross section of the subsurface formation is a square root of an area of the region. Thus a characteristic inner zone length is a square root of an area of inner zone and a characteristic inner zone length is a square root of an area of outer zone . For the regular hexagon example of i the area of inner zone is 6 square root over 3 sso that the characteristic inner zone length is approximately 3.2s ii an area of outer zone is three times that of inner zone so that the characteristic outer zone length is approximately 5.6s. For the lozenge example of i the area of inner zone is 8 square root over 3 sso that the characteristic inner zone length is approximately 3.7s ii an area of outer zone is three times that of inner zone so that the characteristic outer zone length is approximately 6.4s.

It is appreciated that heaters are typically within heater wells e.g. having elongate sections any heater spatial pattern and any feature or combination of feature s disclosed herein may also be a heater well pattern.

One salient feature of the pattern arrangement of is the presence of production wells both within inner and outer zones.

In these patterns one or more production wells may be located within the inner and one or more production wells may be located within the outer zone. The number of production wells and the placement of the production wells within the zone may depend on a number of physical and economic considerations including but limited to the permeability of the resource reservoir pressures density of heater wells heat injection rate fluid flow paths and well costs. For example there may be a tradeoff between the incremental cost of an increased number of production wells and the resulting lower average reservoir pressure and higher oil recovery efficiency. In another example production well locations may define the fluid flow paths and flow of hydrocarbon fluids nearby heater wells may cause more cracking or coking leading to lower oil recovery efficiency. A reservoir simulation program such as STARS made by Computer Modeling Group LTD may be used to determine the economically optimized number and location of production wells in the inner and outer zones.

One or more production wells are needed within the inner zone in order to enable the earlier production from the closer heater spacing in the inner zone. Higher pressures may develop in the inner zone unless one or more production wells are located in the inner zone.

In addition one or more production wells are needed in the outer zone because once the inner zone has been substantially pyrolyzed hydrocarbons generated in the outer zone may experience more cracking and coking from flow paths directed towards the one or more inner zone production wells.

Having patterns with both one or more inner and outer zone production wells allows convection of heat from fluid flow from the inner zone into the outer zone. This also provides additional operational flexibility so that after the inner zone has been substantially pyrolyzed one or more inner zone production wells may be shut in to encourage convection of heat from the inner zone into the outer zone.

In various embodiments some or all i.e. any combination of the following features related to heater patterns may be observed 

 A A heater spatial density within the inner zone significantly exceeds that of the outer zone and or an average spacing between neighboring heaters within the outer zone significantly exceeds that of the inner zone and or within outer zone an average distance to a nearest heater significantly exceeds that of inner zone . As will be discussed below with reference to in some embodiments heater patterns providing this feature may be useful for expediting a rate of conversion of kerogen and or bitumen of the hydrocarbon bearing formation into hydrocarbon fluids within inner zone so that an inner zone production peak occurs in an earlier stage of production and an outer zone production peak only occurs after a delay.

 B Inner zone heaters and outer zone heaters are distributed around respective centroids of inner and outer zones. As will be discussed below see when heaters are distributed around a centroid then for every orientation of a reference ray starting at an origin at the location of the centroid or at least one heater is located i.e. the heater cross section centroid is located in every quadrant i.e. every 90 degree sector defined by the origin centroid or . In different embodiments heaters are arranged within inner and or outer zones so that inner zone heaters or outer zone heaters are present on every 72 degree sector or on every 60 degree sector or on every 45 degree sector of inner or outer zones for every reference ray orientation.

 C Outer zone heaters are predominantly located on or near the outer zone perimeter . In some embodiments the relatively high density of heaters in inner zone causes an outward flow of thermal energy from inner zone into outer zone . Arrangement of outer zone heaters so that they are predominantly located on or near the outer zone perimeter may facilitate the inward flow of thermal energy so as to at least partly balance the outward flow of thermal energy into outer zone from inner zone .

In some embodiments where heaters are deployed at most sparsely in the interior portion of outer zone away from inner and outer zone perimeters . This may be useful for reducing a number of heaters required to produce hydrocarbon fluids in a required manner. Furthermore the relative lack of heaters within the middle portion of outer zone i.e. distanced from both perimeters may delay production of fluids from this middle portion of outer zone and within outer zone as a whole. As will be discussed below with reference to this delay may be useful for producing hydrocarbon fluids in a manner where a significant production rate e.g. at least half of a maximum production rate is sustained for a relatively extended period of time.

 D A ratio between areas enclosed by the outer and inner perimeters is at least 3 or at least 3.5 and or at most 10 or at most 9 or at most 8 or at most 7 or at most 6 or at most 5 or at most 4.5 and or about 4. In the examples of this ratio is exactly four. In some embodiments arranging heaters according to any of these ratios may be useful for producing hydrocarbons so that an overall rate of production ramps up relatively rapidly i.e. short rise time while is sustained for a relatively extended period of time. In some embodiment if this ratio is too small then the amount of time that the rate of production is sustained may be too short and or the thermal efficiency of the heater pattern may be reduced due to a reduction in the re use of thermal energy from inner zone heaters within outer zone . If this ratio is too large this may for example cause a dip in production after hydrocarbon fluids are rapidly produced within inner zone .

 E The centroid of inner zone is located in a central portion of the region enclosed by outer zone perimeter upon visual inspection of the heater patterns of it is clear that this is true for all of these heater patterns. In some embodiments substantially centering the inner zone within outer zone is useful for ensuring that a higher fraction of thermal energy from heaters within inner zone is re used within outer zone thus increasing the overall thermal efficiency of the heater pattern. Unless specified otherwise when centroid of inner zone is located in a central portion of the region enclosed by outer zone perimeter centroid of inner zone is in the inner third of a region enclosed by outer zone perimeter . In some embodiments centroid of inner zone is in the inner quarter or inner fifth or inner sixth or inner tenth.

 F In the example of there is no contact between perimeters of inner and outer zones . In some embodiments at least 30 or at least a majority of inner zone perimeter is located away from outer zone perimeter . In some embodiments at least a majority or at least a significant majority i.e. at least 75 of the inner zone heaters are located away from the outer zone perimeter .

When an inner zone heater or a point on inner zone perimeter is located away from a perimeter of outer zone this means that the located away inner zone heater or the located away point on inner zone perimeter is displaced from the outer zone perimeter by at least a threshold distance. Unless otherwise specified this threshold distance is at least one half of an inner zone average heater spacing.

Alternatively or additionally in some embodiments this threshold distance is at least i at least two thirds of the inner zone average heater spacing and or ii at least the inner zone average heater spacing or iii at least an average distance within inner zone i.e. averaged over all locations within inner zone to a nearest heater and or ii at least three times or at least four times or at least five times the square root of the area of the inner zone divided the number of inner zone heaters. In the example of the square root of the area of the inner zone is 3.2s and the number of inner zone heaters is 19 so four times the square root of the area of the inner zone is about 0.51s. In the example of the square root of the area of the inner zone is 3.8s and the number of inner zone heaters is 25 so four times the square root of the area of the inner zone is about 0.44s.

 G Perimeters of inner and or outer zones are convex or substantially convex the skilled artisan is directed to the definition of substantially convex described below with reference to . In some embodiments this may be useful for facilitating outward flow of heat generated by inner zone heaters located at or near the perimeter of inner zone e.g. so that heat from inner zone heaters located at or near inner zone perimeter flows outwards into outer zone and toward outer zone perimeter rather than flowing inwards towards a centroid of inner zone . In some embodiments this increases the thermal efficiency of the heater pattern. In some embodiments a candidate shape is substantially convex if an area enclosed by a minimally enclosed convex shape exceeds the area of the candidate shape by at most 20 or at most 10 or at most 5 .

For the present disclosure whenever something i.e. an area or a closed curve such as a perimeter of an area is described as convex it may in some embodiments be substantially convex. Whenever something is described as substantially convex it may in alternative embodiments be convex.

 H An isoperimetric quotient of perimeters of the inner and or outer zone is at least 0.4 or at least about 0.5 or at least 0.6. In the present disclosure an isoperimetric quotient of a closed curve is defined as the isoperimetric coefficient of the area enclosed by the closed curve i.e.

 I An aspect ratio of perimeter of inner and or of perimeter of outer zone is at most 5 or at most 4.5 or at most 4 or at most 3.5 or at most 3 or at most 2.5 or at most 2.0 or at most 1.5. An aspect ratio of a shape i.e. either the shape or an enclosing perimeter thereof refers to a ratio between its longer dimension and its shorter dimension. In some embodiments the inner and outer zones have a similar and or relatively low aspect ratio that may be useful for efficient re use of inner zone generated thermal energy within outer zone and or for obtaining a production curve exhibiting a relatively fast rise time with sustained substantial production rate.

 J Perimeters of inner and or outer zones have common shape characteristics. In the example of inner and outer zone perimeters are like shaped. This is not the case in or in . Nevertheless in the example the perimeters of inner and outer zone substantially share a common aspect ratio i.e. ratio between a longer dimension and a shorter dimensions and or substantially share a common isoperimeteric quotient. In some embodiments IPQis the isoperimeter quotient of inner zone IPQis the isoperimeter quotient of outer zone MAX IPQ IPQ is the greater of IPQand IPQ MIN IPQ IPQ is the lesser of IPQand IPQ and a ratio

 K In some embodiments heaters are distributed substantially uniformly in inner and or outer outer zone. This may allow for more efficient heating of inner zone . In some embodiments visual inspection of a heater layout diagram describing positions of heater cross sections is sufficient to indicate when heaters are distributed substantially uniformly throughout one or more of the zone s .

Alternatively or additionally heaters may be distributed so as to provide a relatively low heater standard deviation spacing relative to a heater average spacing in one or more of the zone s .

Within any area of the subsurface formation e.g. within inner zone or outer zone there are a number of neighboring heater spacings within the area of the formation for example in i.e. there are 36 spacings in outer zone i.e. 30 of the spacings have values of 2a and 6 of the spacings have values of square root over 3 a and there are 32 spacings in inner zone i.e. all 36 of the spacings have a value of a . In this example the average spacing in inner zone is exactly a while the average spacing in outer zone is

In different embodiments a quotient between a standard deviation spacing and an average spacing is at most 0.5 or at most 0.4 or at most 0.3 or at most 0.2 or at most 0.1.

 L In some embodiments heaters are dispersed throughout inner zone rather than being limited to specific locations within inner zone e.g. perimeter upon visual inspection of the heater patterns of it is clear that this feature is true for all of these heater patterns. In some embodiments the heaters are distributed according to an average heater spacing that is small compared to some characteristic length of inner zone for example an average heater spacing within inner zone may be at most one half or at most two fifths or at most one third or at most one quarter of the square root of an area of inner zone . This close heater spacing relative to a characteristic length of inner zone may be useful for outwardly directing thermal energy from inner zone heaters so as to facilitate heat flow into outer zone .

In some embodiments a ratio between i a product of a number of inner zone heaters and a square of the average spacing in the inner zone and ii an area of inner zone is at least 0.75 or at least 1 or at least 1.25 or at least 1.5.

In some embodiments at least 10 or at least 20 or at least 30 or at least 40 or at least 50 of inner zone heaters are interior of inner zone heaters located within inner zone away from inner zone perimeter 

 M One or more production wells located in inner and or outer zones. In some embodiments one or more production wells e.g. multiple production wells are arranged within inner and or outer zones to efficiently recovering hydrocarbon fluids from the subsurface. In some embodiments locating production well s in inner zone is useful for quickly removing hydrocarbon fluids located therein. In some embodiments it is useful to locate production wells on different sides of the inner zone so as to facilitate the fast and or efficient removal of hydrocarbon fluids from the subsurface formation.

When two inner zone production wells having respective locations LOCand LOCare are on different sides of inner zone having centroid CENT the angle LOCCENTLOCsubtended by the locations of the two production wells through inner zone centroid CENT is at least 90 degrees or at least 100 degrees or at least 110 degrees or at least 120 degrees . When outer inner zone production wells having respective locations LOCand LOCare are on different sides of outer zone having outer zone centroid CENT the angle LOCCENTLOCsubtended by the locations of the two production wells through outer zone centroid CENT is at least 90 degrees.

When two production wells having respective locations LOCand LOCare are on different sides of inner zone having centroid CENT the angle LOCCENTLOCsubtended by the locations of the two production wells through inner zone centroid CENT is at least 90 degrees.

 N A majority or a substantial majority of heaters within inner zone are distributed on a triangular or rectangular e.g. square or hexagonal pattern. In some embodiments this allows for more efficient heating of inner zone 

For identical heaters spaced on a triangular heater well pattern all operating at constant power the time tto heat the formation to pyrolysis temperature by thermal conduction is approximately EQN. 1 where Dis the spacing between adjacent heater wells Dis the diameter of the heater wells and c is a proportionality constant that depends on the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of the formation.

As noted above heaters are deployed at a relatively high density within inner zone and at a relatively low density within inner zone . Similarly an average spacing between neighboring heaters within the outer zone significantly exceeds that of the inner zone .

In some embodiments the amount of time required to pyrolyze kerogen and or to carry out any other in situ hydrocarbon production process for example producing hydrocarbon fluids from tar sands is substantially less in the inner zone than in the outer zone due to the relatively high heater density and or relatively short heater spacing in the inner zone .

A number of illustrative hydrocarbon production functions related to two level heater cells are presented in . In particular the time dependence of hydrocarbon fluid production rate in i the inner zone see inner zone production rate curve ii outer zone see outer zone production rate curve iii the combined region defined as the combination of inner and outer zones this is equivalent to the area enclosed by a perimeter of the outer zone see combined region production rate curve are all presented in accordance with this illustrative example.

Because of the relatively close heater spacing in the inner zone i.e. in the example of the heater spacing in inner zone is exactly one half that of outer zone temperatures in the inner zone rise more rapidly than in the outer zone so as to expedite the production of hydrocarbons in the inner zone . In contrast in most locations in the outer zone a hydrocarbon production temperature e.g. a pyrolysis temperature is reached only after a significant time delay.

In the example of an inner zone production rate peak occurs before an outer zone production rate peak . During the intervening time period a production dip may be observed. In other examples it may be possible to minimize and or eliminate the production dip for example by controlling e.g. reducing the power level of inner zone heaters relative to those in outer zone .

Roughly speaking the production rate peak occurs when a particular zone or region reaches hydrocarbon production temperature e.g. a pyrolysis temperature and or a temperature where fluids are mobilized in a heavy oil formation and or bitumen rich formation and or tar sands formation.

As illustrated in a production peak of function describing production in outer zone occurs after a production peak of function describing production in inner zone . Thus it may be said that for a two level heater cell having zones which may be written as Zone Zone where Zoneis the innermost zone or inner zone and Zoneis the first zone outside of the innermost zone or zone that sequential production peaks Peak Peak labeled respectively as and in are observed respectively at times t t. An amount of time required to ramp up to the ipeak Peakis t.

For the example of i the amount of time required to ramp up to the production peak Peak labeled as in for the innermost zone Zone i.e. inner zone is t t and ii the amount of time required to ramp up to the production peak Peak labeled as in for the zone Zone i.e. outer zone immediately outside of the innermost zone is t t .

Also illustrated in is the overall or total rate of hydrocarbon fluid in the combined region i.e. the area enclosed within outer zone perimeter this is the combination of inner and outer zones described by curve having a production rate peak which occurs immediately before that of outer zone .

Inspection of combined region hydrocarbon fluid production rate curve indicates that i similar to inner zone production curve combined region production curve ramps up relatively quickly indicating a fast rise time ii a significant hydrocarbon production rate e.g. at least one half of the maximum production rate is sustained for a relatively long period of time. In the example of a ratio SPT RT between a i a sustained production time SPT i.e. the amount of time that the production rate is contiuously sustained above one half of a maximum production rate level for the combined region and ii a rise time RT for the combined region is relatively large e.g. at least four thirds or at least three halves or at least two.

For the present disclosure a half maximum hydrocarbon fluid production rate rise time or half maximum rise time is the amount of time required for hydrocarbon fluid production to reach one half of its maximum while the half maximum hydrocarbon fluid production rate sustained production time or the half maximum sustained production time is the amount of time where the hydrocarbon fluid production rate is sustained at least one half of its maximum. respectively show production rate curves and for the inner outer and total zones i.e. the combination of inner and outer zones .

In a production dip e.g. occurring after peak and before peak is illustrated. In some embodiments such a production dip or any other production dip may be observed even within a time period of a half maximum hydrocarbon fluid production rate sustained production time as long as the production rate remains above one half of a maximum rate throughout the time period of the half maximum hydrocarbon fluid production rate sustained production time .

A relatively large SPT RT ratio may describe situations where i hydrocarbon fluids are produced e.g. from kerogen or from bitumen and removed from the subsurface after only a minimal delay allowing a relatively rapid return on investment in the projection while using substantially only a minimal number of heaters and ii hydrocarbon fluids are produced for a relatively extended period of time at a relatively constant rate. Because hydrocarbon fluids are produced at a relatively constant rate a ratio between a peak hydrocarbon production rate and an average hydrocarbon production rate for the combined region is relatively small. In some embodiments the amount of infrastructure required for hydrocarbon fluid production and or processing is determined at least in part by the maximum production rate. In some embodiments a relatively low ratio between a peak hydrocarbon production rate and an average hydrocarbon production rate for the combined region may reduce the amount of infrastructure required for fluid production and or processing with a minimal number or near minimal number of pre drilled heater wells.

It is appreciated that none of the examples relating to illustrative production functions are limiting. It may be possible to change the shape of this function for example by operating heaters at different power levels.

Also illustrated in are the earlier and later stages of production. During the earlier stage of production hydrocarbon fluids are produced primarily in inner zone during the later stage of production hydrocarbon fluids are produced primarily in outer zone.

In step S the pre drilled heaters are operated to produce hydrocarbon fluids such that a ratio between a half maximum sustained production time and a rise time is at least four thirds or at least three halves or at least seven quarters or at least two. In some embodiments this is accomplished using any inner zone and outer zone heater pattern disclosed herein. In some embodiments at least a majority of the outer zone heaters commence operation when at most a minority of inner zone hydrocarbon fluids have been produced.

In some embodiments any heater pattern disclosed herein e.g. relating to two level heater cells may be thermally efficient. In particular in some embodiments at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 20 of the thermal energy used for outer zone hydrocarbon fluid production is supplied by outward migration e.g. by heat conduction and or convection of thermal energy from the inner zone to the outer zone .

In frames the average temperature in the inner zone exceeds that of the outer zone and thermal energy migrates outwards e.g. by heat conduction and optionally by heat convection. In some embodiments outward migration of thermal energy contributes to the thermal energy required to produce in the outer zone . In some embodiments this statement is true for a plurality of locations within the outer zone for example locations on substantially opposite sites of the outer zone or distributed around outer zone .

As will be discussed below see for example in some embodiments it is advantageous to increase the rate of outward migration of heat by injecting a heat transfer fluid e.g. carbon dioxide or steam into inner zone at a time when the production in a more inner zone is decreasing. In steps S S and S the inner zone is heated hydrocarbonds are produced first in the inner zone the outer zone is further heated. In step S the combination of i thermal energy which has outwardly migrated from inner to outer zone and ii thermal energy from outer zone heaters sufficiently heats outer zone to produce hydrocarbon fluids therein.

Reference is now made to which describes a time dependence of a power level of inner zone heaters see solid line and outer zone heaters see broken line as a function of time in some embodiments. According to in some embodiments a power level of inner zone and outer zone heaters during a time period when the inner zone production rate ramps up and peaks remains about a half maximum level and only slightly drops off as a function of time. During this time period the rate at which the heater power level drops in the inner zone is greater than in the outer zone.

After inner zone production rate peak during a phase when inner zone production rate declines i at least some of the inner zone heaters are shut off e.g. at least one quarter or at least one third or a majority of the heaters as indicated by the drop of solid line and ii outer zone heaters continue to operate at this constant power level while inner zone heaters are shut off. Thus at this time a difference between an average power of the outer zone heaters and inner zone heaters increases.

Once the production rate in the inner zone has dropped by a certain threshold for example by at least 30 or at least 50 and or at most 90 or at most 70 of a maximum production rate this may indicate that a hydrocarbon fluid production temperature e.g. a temperature which results in mobilized fluids visbreaking and or pyrolysis of hydrocarbon containing material so that mobilized fluids visbroken fluids and or pyrolyzation fluids are produced in the formation has been reached throughout most of the inner zone e.g. a pyrolysis temperature or a temperature for mobilizing hydrocarbon fluids even when significant portions of the outer zone e.g. at least 30 of or a majority of are at a significantly cooler temperature. Studies conducted by the present inventors indicated that once this inner zone production drop has occurred the ability of the inner zone heaters to expedite fluid production is significantly reduced and thus further full power operation of the inner zone heaters may be of only marginal utility and may not justify the energy cost. 

As indicated in in some embodiments it is useful to shut off and or reduce power to the inner zone heaters even while the outer zone heaters continue to operate at about the same power level.

In some embodiments a power level or one or more inner zone heaters is reduced in response to a predicted or detected drop in a rate of production in inner zone e.g. at a time when only a minority of hydrocarbon fluids have been produced in outer zone . In some embodiments the inner zone heater is substantially shut off or deactivated i.e. a power level is reduced by at least 50 in a relatively short amount of time. This short amount of time is at most 30 or 20 or 10 of the time delay between an inner zone production peak and that of outer zone .

In some embodiments in response to the predicted or detected drop in a rate of production in inner zone one or more inner zone heater s are operated so as to cause power level of the one or more inner zone heaters to decrease at a faster rate. This is shown in at a time that an inner zone production rate has dropped X from a peak rate a curve describing a heater power level of an inner zone heater exhibits an inflection point there is an increase in the rate at which the power level of the inner zone heater decreases.

In some embodiments on average the total amount of time that outer zone heaters operate at a power level that is at least one half of a maximum heater power level significantly exceeds that of the inner zone heaters for example by at least a factor of 1.5 or at least a factor of 2 or at last factor of 2.5 or at least a factor of 3 or at least a factor of 4 or at least a factor of 5 or at least a factor of 6 or at least a factor of 8.

One time when power to inner zone heater s may be decreased is shown in and a related method is illustrated in . In some embodiments a value of X is at least 5 and at most 95 for example at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 20 or at least 35 or at least 50 and or at most 75 or at most 50 or at most 35 or at most 25 or at most 20.

As illustrated in it is possible at least partially restrict flow within production well s and or to shut off inner zone production wells or to restrict a flow of formation fluids therein as well. In the example of i inner zone heater s may be shut off or subjected to a sudden decrease in output power and ii inner zone production wells may also be shut off and or operated to restrict flow therein so as to reduce a rate of production below what would be observed without the restriction of flow of formation fluids.

In the example of the production well is completely shut off. It is appreciated that this is not a limitation and that in some embodiments flow may be restricted within the production well without entirely shutting the well off i.e. the flow is at least partially restricted.

In some embodiments a value of Y is at least 5 and at most 95 for example at least 10 or at least at least 25 or at least 35 or at least 50 or at least 65 or at least 75 and or at most 95 or at most 75 or at most 65 or at most 50 or at most 35. In some embodiments a ratio between Y and X is at least 1 or at least 1.25 or at least 1.5 or at least 2 and or at most 3 or at most 2 or at most 1.5.

Alternatively or additionally is illustrated in it is possible to inject a heat transfer fluid e.g. carbon dioxide or steam or any other heat transfer fluid into the inner zone. This technique may be provided in together with that of or instead of this technique.

In some embodiments a value of Z is at least 5 and at most 95 for example at least 10 or at least at least 25 or at least 35 or at least 50 or at least 65 or at least 75 and or at most 95 or at most 75 or at most 65 or at most 50 or at most 35. In some embodiments a ratio between Z and Z is at least 1 or at least 1.25 or at least 1.5 or at least 2 and or at most 3 or at most 2 or at most 1.5.

As will be discussed below with reference to in some embodiments it is advantageous to deploy mostly electrical heaters i.e. which have a relatively low capital cost but a lower operating efficiency in the inner zone and mostly molten salt heaters which have a higher capital cost but are more efficient to operate in the outer zone. Because the outer zone heaters operate on average for a significantly longer period of time in some embodiments the total amount of thermal energy supplied to the subsurface formation by operation of outer zone heaters is greater or significantly greater for example as least 1.5 times as much or at least twice as much than the total amount of thermal energy supplied by operation of inner zone heaters .

As discussed elsewhere in the present disclosure molten salt heaters are one example of advection based heaters. In some embodiments it is advantageous to deploy mostly electrical heaters i.e. which have a relatively low capital cost but a lower operating efficiency in the inner zone and mostly advection based heaters which have a higher capital cost but are more efficient to operate in the outer zone. Similarly combustion based heaters may have a higher capital cost but may be more efficient to operate.

As illustrated in in some embodiments the heater pattern of or of any other embodiment disclosed herein for example see any of may repeat itself. Thus in some embodiments any inner zone outer zone heater pattern disclosed herein may be a unit cell heater pattern which repeats itself. Since any heater pattern disclosed herein and any feature s thereof or combination thereof may also be a heater well pattern the heater well pattern of or of any other embodiment disclosed herein may repeat itself.

In the example of the heater pattern of exactly repeats itself in each cell so as to fill space of a subsurface formation i.e. the unit heater cells are identical. As illustrated in the example of the identical cell feature is not a limitation and heater cells are not required to be exactly repeating unit cells. In some embodiments each heater cell may individually provide common features i.e. any combination of features disclosed herein including but not limited to features related to heater spacing features heater spatial density feature s features related to size s and or shape of inner and or outer zones or relationships between them production well features features relating to operation of heaters or any other feature .

In the example of for each heater cell an area enclosed by outer zone perimeter is about four times that of inner zone perimeter a heater density within inner zone significantly exceeds that of outer zone at least a substantial majority of the inner zone heaters are located away from outer zone perimeter production well s are located in each of inner and outer zones.

In the example of for a plurality of the heater cells i the area of all cells are substantially equal to a single common value ii for each heater cell of the plurality of cells a significant portion i.e. at least one third or at least one half or at least two thirds or at least three quarters of each cell perimeter e.g. outer zone perimeter is located close to a neighboring cell perimeter.

A candidate location of a first heater cell i.e. within the cell or on a perimeter thereof e.g. cell A is located close to a second heater cell e.g. cell B or C if a distance between i the candidate location of the first heater cell and ii a location of the second heater cell that is closest to the candidate location of the first heater cell is less than a threshold distance. Unless otherwise specified this threshold distance is at most two fifths of a square root of an area of the first heater cell. In some embodiments this threshold distance is at most one third or at most one quarter or at most one sixth or at most one tenth of a square root of an area of the first heater cell.

In some embodiments for each of first and second neighboring heater cells e.g. having substantially equal areas at least a portion e.g. at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 20 or at least 30 or at least 40 or at least a majority of of each cell perimeter selected from one of the first and second heater cells is close to the other heater cell.

In the example of one of the cells is a surrounded cell whereby an entirety of its perimeter is close to neighboring heater cells. For the present disclosure a heater cell is substantially surrounded when a substantial majority i.e. at least 75 of its perimeter is close to a neighboring heater cell. In the example of different portions of a perimeter of surrounded cell are close to six different neighboring heater cells. In some embodiments different portions of a perimeter of surrounded cell are close to at least 3 or at least 4 or at least 5 different neighboring cells e.g. a majority of which or at least 3 or at least 4 or at least 5 of which have an area that is substantially equal to that of surrounded cell .

Also labeled in are first and second neighboring cells which are located on opposite sides of surrounded cell . In the present disclosure two neighboring cells CELLand CELLhaving respective centroids CENT CELL and CENT CELL are said to be substantially on opposite sites of a candidate heater cell CELLhaving a centroid CENT CELL if an angle CENT CELL CENT CELL CENT CELL is at least 120 degrees. In some embodiments this angle is at least 130 degrees or at least 140 degrees or at least 150 degrees.

One salient feature of the multi cell embodiment of is that neighboring cells may share one or more e.g. at least two common outer perimeter heaters . In this situation each of the shared heater serves as an outer perimeter heater for two or more neighboring cells. In the example of neighboring heater cells may share up to three common outer perimeter heaters.

Without limitation in some embodiments the multi cell pattern based upon nested hexagons e.g. having two levels as illustrated in or having three or levels as discussed below may provide one or more of the following benefits i a significantly lower heater well density e.g. at most three thirds or at most three fifths or at most one half compared to what would be observed for the hypothetical case where all heaters were arranged at a uniform density equal to that of the inner zones ii a relatively short time to first production e.g. see iii a lower energy use due to heat exchange between zones and or between neighboring cells and or iv due to the presence of production wells in inner zones as well as outer zones more oil and less gas is produced because fluids pass near fewer heater wells en route to a production well hence less cracking. In some embodiments inner zone heaters are primarily less efficient electric heaters while outer zone heaters are primarily more efficient molten salt heaters see for example . As such in some embodiments the use of molten salt heaters in outer zones increases the overall energy efficiency of hydrocarbon production.

In some embodiments inner zone heaters are primarily less efficient electric heaters while outer zone heaters are primarily advection based heaters e.g. molten salt heaters that employ molten salt as a heat transfer fluid or advection based heaters that employ a heat transfer fluid other than molten salt e.g. a gas or a liquid other than molten salt .

It appreciated that other embodiments other than that of may provide some or all of the aforementioned benefits.

The pattern of is similar to that of however in the example of production wells are arranged at the centroid of each heater cell while in the example of heaters are arranged at the centroid of each heater cell.

In a region of subsurface formation is filled with multiple heater cells including cell A cell B and cell C . As illustrated in cells A and C share common outer zone perimeter heater W cells A and B share common outer zone perimeter heater X cells B and C share common outer perimeter heater Y .

As illustrated in in some embodiments the heater cells do not have identical patterns and the heater cells may be thought of as quasi unit cells rather than unit cells. In the example of even though heater cells are not identical each heater cell individually may contain any combination of feature s relating to inner and outer zones described in any embodiment herein. The features include but are not limited to features related to heater spacing e.g. shorter average spacing between neighboring heaters in inner zone than in outer zone heater density e.g. higher density in inner zone than in outer zone dimensions of inner and or outer zone perimeters e.g. related to aspect ratio or related to a ratio between respective areas of outer and inner zones or of areas enclosed by perimeters thereof average distance to a nearest heater dispersion and or distribution of heaters within inner and or outer zone heater distribution along inner and or outer zone perimeter s or any other feature e.g. including but not limited to feature s related to heater location .

In the example of neighboring cells all have like shaped and like sized inner zone and outer zone perimeters . This is not a limitation. In some embodiments areas or aspect ratios of inner zone and or outer zone perimeters of neighboring cells i.e. which optionally share at least one common outer zone heater may be similar but not identical. In some embodiments for any cell pair CELL CELL of neighboring heater cells CELL CELLan area enclosed by inner zone and or outer zone perimeters of CELLis i equal to at least 0.5 times and at most 2.0 times that of CELLor ii equal to at least 0.666 times and at most 1.5 times that of CELL or iii equal to at least 0.8 and at most 1.2 times that of CELL. In some embodiments for any pair of neighboring heater cells CELL CELLan aspect ratio of inner zone and or outer zone perimeters of CELLis i equal to at least 0.5 times and at most 2.0 times that of CELLor ii equal to at least 0.666 times and at most 1.5 times that of CELL or iii equal to at least 0.8 and at most 1.2 times that of CELL.

In some embodiments any feature s in the previous paragraph relating any pair of neighboring heater cells CELL CELLmay be true for at least one pair of neighboring heater cells CELL CELL. In some embodiments any feature s may be true for various pair sets of cells. For example if a cell CELLsurrounded by a plurality of neighbors CELL CELL . . . CELL any feature s of the previous paragraph previous paragraph may be true for at least a majority or for all of the following cell pairs CELL CELL CELL CELL . . . CELL CELL.

In some embodiments a region of the subsurface formation i.e. a two dimensional portion of a cross section of the subsurface formation may be substantially filled by a plurality of heater cells if at least 75 or at least 80 or at least 90 of the area of the region is occupied by one of the heater cells. In some embodiments the cell filled region includes at least 3 or at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 15 or at least 20 or at least 50 or at least 100 heater cells and or is rectangular in shape and or circular in shape or having any other shape and or has an aspect ratio of at most 3 or at most 2.5 or at most 2 or at most 1.5. In some embodiments any feature s relating pairs of neighboring cells i.e. relating to the sharing of outer perimeter heaters or related to neighboring pairs of heaters CELL CELL may be true for a majority of heater cells or at least 75 of the heater cells or at least 90 of the heater cells within the cell filled region. In some embodiments both a length and a width of the cell filled region i.e. measured in heater cells may be at least 3 or at least 5 or at least 10 or at least 20 heater cells.

OZS additional zone heaters i.e. heaters located OZS additional zone perimeter or in an interior of OZS additional zone include OZS additional zone perimeter heaters each located on or near OZS additional zone perimeter and distributed around OZS additional zone perimeter . In some embodiments OZS additional zone heaters are predominantly OZS additional zone perimeter heaters this is analogous to the feature provided by some embodiments and described above whereby outer zone heaters are predominantly outer zone perimeter heaters .

For the present disclosure the OZS refers to the entire area enclosed by a perimeter thereof. that is also outside of outer zone .

In the example of an area enclosed by a perimeter of OZS additional zone and four times that of outer zone perimeter and an average heater spacing within OZS additional zone is about twice that of outer zone . In the example of perimeters of inner outer and OZS additional zones are regular hexagonal in shape and have respective side lengths equal to 2s 4s and 8s. In the example of respective average heater spacings of inner outer and OZS additional zones are equal to s approximately equal to 2s and approximately equal to 4s. In different embodiments a perimeter of OZS additional zone is convex or substantially convex.

In different embodiments a relation between OCS additional zone and outer zone is analogous to that between outer zone and inner zone . Thus in some embodiments by analogy any feature described herein a relationship between inner and outer zones may also be provided for outer and OZS additional zones. Such features include but are not limited to features related to heater spacing e.g. shorter average spacing between neighboring heaters in inner zone than in outer zone heater density e.g. higher density in inner zone than in outer zone dimensions of inner and or outer zone perimeters e.g. related to aspect ratio or related to a ratio between respective areas of outer and inner zones or of areas enclosed by perimeters thereof average distance to a nearest heater dispersion and or distribution of heaters within inner and or outer zone heater distribution along inner and or outer zone perimeter s or any other feature e.g. including but not limited to feature s related to heater location .

As was noted above for the case of a perimeter of outer zone in different embodiments the perimeter of OZS additional zone may be defined by locations of the heater i.e. to form some a ring shaped cluster where adjacent locations have a significantly lower heater density .

In the example of production wells are arranged through each of inner outer and OZS additional zone and are respectively labeled in as inner zone I outer zone O and additional zone A production wells. In the example of the density of production wells is greatest in the most inner zone i.e. inner zone is the least in the most outer zone i.e. additional zone and has an intermediate value in the mediating zone i.e. outer zone . In particular a ratio between an inner zone production well density and that of outer zone is three a ratio between an outer zone production well density and that of additional zone is also three.

In the particular example of perimeters of outer and OZS additional zones are like shaped. As illustrated in this is not a limitation.

Even though perimeters of outer and inner zones are not required to be like shaped but they may share certain shape properties for example an aspect ratio see for example or any other shape related parameter discussed herein.

In some embodiments desired characteristics of a production profile for an oil and gas project are a fast rise time to a peak production rate followed by a sustained period of production at approximately the peak rate. The fast rise time allows for an early return on the initial capital investment and the sustained production allows for efficient long term use of the existing infrastructure. This preferred production profile is an inherent property of the nested heater pattern where the product of the heater density and area of each successive nested zone is held constant or A constant where Ai is the area and is the heater density of each successive nested zone i. The production from a three layer nested hexagonal pattern is illustrated in . The production from the inner zone IZ has a fast rise time due to the high heater density of the inner zone. Because the heater density in the outer zone is reduced by a factor A A the production of the outer zone OZ is also delayed in time by an amount A Arelative to the IZ production peak while the cumulative production from the outer zone is increased by a factor A Arelative to the inner zone cumulative production. Therefore as the production from an inner zone begins to decline the production from an outer zone increases resulting in a total production rate which is relatively constant throughout the sustained production time.

Although this has been described for the nested hexagonal pattern it is generally true for any shape of nested heater pattern that satisfies the equation A constant for each successive nested zone.

In contrast to the heater and or production well patterns illustrated in which are generally two level patterns relate to three level patterns. In the inner most zone i.e. inner zone heaters are arranged at the shortest spacing and or greatest density. Each successive zone more outer zone is has a greater area than the previous more inner zone and is characterized by a larger heater spacing and or lesser heater density and or less production well density.

Thus if a heater cell or an area of the subsurface formation is divided into a N nested zones relates to the specific case of N 2. In this particular case within each heater cell only one neighboring zone pair NZP is defined i.e. inner zone outer zone where the first zone of the ordered pair is the more inner zone and the second zone of the ordered pair is the outer zone.

For the three level cells of N 3 and there are N 1 i.e. two neighboring zone pairs inner zone outer zone and outer zone OZS additional zone . Because inner zone and OZS additional zone are clearly not neighbors i.e. because they are separated by the intervening outer zone there is no neighboring zone pair NZP that includes both inner zone and OZS additional zone .

For the four level cell of N 4 and there are N 1 i.e. three neighboring zone pairs NZP inner zone outer zone outer zone OZS additional zone and OZS additional zone fourth zone .

Embodiments described in relate to a system for in situ production of hydrocarbon fluids from a subsurface hydrocarbon containing formation the system comprising a heater cell divided into N nested zones N 2 each zone having a respective centroid e.g. outer zone centroid or inner zone centroid and a respective substantially convex polygon shaped perimeter e.g. inner zone perimeter outer zone perimeter or OZS additional zone perimeter such that heaters are located at every vertex thereof.

For each neighboring zone pair NZP of the N 1 neighboring zone pairs defined by the N nested zones an area ratio between respective areas enclosed by perimeters of the more outer zone and the more inner zone of the zone pair NZP is at most seven or at most six or at most five and or at least three or at least 3.5 and or between two and seven e.g. at least two or at least three and or at most seven or at most six or at most five .

In some embodiments for each neighboring zone pair NZP of the N 1 neighboring zone pairs heaters of each zone are respectively distributed around each zone centroid e.g. such that a heater spatial density of the more inner zone of the zone pair NZP significantly exceeds that of the more outer zone of the zone pair NZP and or is at least about twice that of the more outer zone of the zone pair NZP and or is at least twice that of e.g. about twice that of the more outer zone of the zone pair NZP.

Alternatively or additionally for each neighboring zone pair NZP of the N 1 neighboring zone pairs heaters of each zone are respectively distributed around each zone centroid e.g. such that a heater spatial density of the more inner zone significantly exceeds that of the more outer zone and or is at least twice e.g. about three times that of that of the more outer zone of the zone pair NZP.

Alternatively or additionally for each neighboring zone pair NZP of the N 1 neighboring zone pairs an average distance to a nearest heater within the more outer zone significantly exceeds that e.g. at least twice that of or at least about twice that of and or at most three times of or at most about three times that of of the less outer zone and or an average distance to a nearest heater on the perimeter of the more outer zone perimeter is equal to at most about twice that of the less outer zone.

In some embodiments there are production wells in the innermost zone . In some embodiments there are production wells in one or more zones located outside of i.e. more outer than the innermost zone in zone and or in zone and or zone . This feature may also be correct for three level heater patterns.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to patterns of heaters. The heaters used may be electrical heaters such as conductor in conduit or mineral insulated heaters downhole gas combustors or heaters heated by high temperature heat transfer fluids such as superheated steam oils CO or molten salts or others. Because the outer zones of heaters may be energized for a substantially longer time than the inner zone of heaters for example four times or eight times longer see a heater with high reliability and long life is preferred for the outer or OZS additional zones. Molten salt heaters have very long lifetimes because they operate at nearly constant temperature without hot spots and in many chemical plant and refinery applications molten salt heaters have been operated for decades without shutdown. In addition molten salt heaters may have very high energy efficiency approaching 80 and over the lifetime of the reservoir most of the thermal energy will be supplied to the oil shale from the heaters in the zones with the longest spacing.

A schematic of an advection based heater is illustrated in . Although the source of hot heat transfer fluid is illustrated in the figures as above the surface this is not a requirement alternatively or additionally it is possible to heat the heat transfer fluid at one or more subsurface location s .

As illustrated in in some embodiments the inner zone of heaters with shortest spacing may be primarily or entirely electrical heaters while in outer zone the heaters because may be primarily molten salt heaters. There may be a number of reasons for providing this feature for example the inner zone heaters may operate for a significantly shorter period time than heaters in the outer zone see for example . As such it may be advantageous to save capital costs by using a heater pattern where inner zone heaters are primarily electrical. In contrast the outer zone heaters may operate for a significantly longer period of time so that the extra efficiency of molten salt heaters may justify the extra capital cost required for their installation.

In yet another example it may be desirable to start a project with electrical heaters for the inner pattern because of the simplicity of field installation. As later surrounding zones are drilled with longer spacings the heaters may be molten salt heaters.

The skilled artisan will appreciate that the feature whereby mostly electrical heaters are located in regions having a higher heater density and or lower heater spacing. is not a limitation. In alternate embodiments some or most or all inner zone heaters may be molten salt heaters.

In some embodiments because there are many fewer heaters wells in the outer zone the construction of the heater well may be more robust even though it is more expensive. For example since these heater wells may operate for longer periods of time it may be desirable to use thicker well casings with more allowance for metal corrosion.

In different embodiments at least a majority and or a least two thirds of inner zone heaters are electrical heaters while at least a majority and or a least two thirds of outer zone heaters are molten salt heaters.

Various non limiting heater patterns are illustrated in . As will be explained below in greater detail in regions of greater heater density and or where the average heater spacing is shorter heaters may be primarily electrical heaters while in regions of lesser heater density and or where the average heater spacing is longer heaters may be primarily molten salt heaters.

All of relate to system for in situ production of hydrocarbon fluids from a subsurface hydrocarbon containing formation where the system comprises heaters arranged in a target portion of the formation the target portion being divided into nested inner and outer zones heaters so that inner zone and outer zone heaters are respectively distributed around inner and outer zone centroids a majority of the heaters in the inner zone being electrical heaters and a majority of the heaters in the outer zone being molten salt heaters.

The examples of relate to two level heaters cells while the examples of relate to three level heater cells. Although all of the three level heater cells illustrated in are hexagonally shaped heater cells it is appreciated that other shapes are possible and that this is not a limitation.

One salient feature of molten salt heaters is that they are more efficient than electrical heaters. Although the exact efficiencies may vary one reasonable benchmark of molten salt heater efficiency is about 80 in contrast to an efficiency of about 45 for electrical heaters.

When the level of nesting is equal to 2 this means that heaters of the cell are arranged as illustrated in . When the level of nesting is equal to 3 this means that heaters of the cell are arranged as illustrated in . When the level of nesting is equal to 4 this means that heaters of the cell are arranged as illustrated in . assumes that all heaters in the innermost zone are electrical heaters having an efficiency of exactly 45 while all other heaters i.e. outside of the innermost zone are molten salt heaters having an efficiency of exactly 89 .

The normalized heater density is 100 times the actual heater density divided by what would be the heater density if all heaters within the cell were uniformly arranged at the closest heater spacing that within the innermost zone . For the case of a one level cell by definition this is equal to exactly 100. For the case of a two level cell this is about 50 i.e. the number of heaters belonging to a two level hexagon is about one half the number of heaters that would be within the same hexagon assuming all heaters are uniformly arranged one a triangular grid at the heater spacing of the innermost zone . For the case of a three level cell the normalized heater density is about 20 and for the case of a four level cell the normalized heater density is less than 10.

The average efficiency per heater throughout the cell see monotonically increases as a function of the number of levels in the cell. In particular when the cell has only a single level all heaters are electrical heaters and the efficiency per heater is exactly 45 i.e. according to the assumptions of . As the cell has more levels the fraction of heaters within the heater cell that are molten salt heaters increases approaching 80 . It is noted however that the difference in heater efficiency between three level and four level heater cells is only a few percent. Thus the major gains in efficiency achieved by using multiple cell levels are obtained when moving from a one level to a two level cell i.e. from 45 efficiency to slightly above 60 efficiency and when moving from a two level to a three level cell i.e. from 45 slightly above 60 efficiency to slightly above 75 efficiency .

It is noted that only refers to a single surrounded interior cell in a uniform pattern of heater cells where all heater cells are identical and the pattern is infinite in the x y plane i.e no edge effects were considered.

Some embodiments relate to neighboring heaters or average spacing between neighboring heaters. Reference is made to . In heaters are arranged according to the same heater pattern as in and heaters are labeled as follows seven of the outer perimeters heaters are labeled A G and nine of the inner zone heaters are labeled as H P. illustrates a portion of the heater pattern of .

It is clear from that some heaters may be said to neighbor each other for example heaters C and D are neighbors heaters C and J are neighbors heaters J and K are neighbors while for other heaters this is not true. Heaters C and L of the heater pair C L are clearly not neighbors. This is because heater connecting line segment Seg Connect C L connecting heaters i.e. connecting the centroids of their respective cross sections of the pair C L having a length 2 square root over 3 s crosses at least one shorter heater connecting line segment as illustrated in . In particular heater connecting line segment Seg Connect C L crosses i Seg Connect D K having a length of square root over 3 s and ii Seg Connect D J having a length of 2s.

Two heaters Heater Heaterare neighboring heaters if the connecting line segment between them i.e. between their respective centroids does not intersect a connecting line segment between two other heaters Heater Heaterin the subsurface formation. A heater connecting line segment between neighboring heaters is resident within a region of the subsurface formation i.e. a two dimensional cross section thereof if a majority of the length of the heater connecting line segment is located within the region of the subsurface formation.

For the present disclosure an average spacing between neighboring heaters and an average heater spacing are used synonymously.

For heater patterns that employ both electrical heaters and molten salt heaters see for example three types of neighboring heater pairs may be observed i all electrical heater pairs i.e. both heaters of the neighboring heater pair are electrical heaters ii all molten salt heater pairs i.e. both heaters of the neighboring heater pair are molten salt heaters and iii electrical molten salt heater pairs i.e. one of the neighboring heater pair is an electrical heater the other heater of the neighboring heater pair is a molten salt heater .

It is that noted the heater pattern of is identical to that of as such the line segments describing the neighboring heater pairs for the example of are illustrated in .

For the example of it is clear that the spacing between electrical heaters is significantly less than that between molten salt heaters. In particular it is noted that i for each heater pair of the set of all electrical neighboring heater pairs the length of the neighboring heater line segment connecting heaters of the pair is always s ii for each heater pair of the set of all molten salt neighboring heater pairs the length of the neighboring heater line segment connecting heaters of the pair is always 2s iii for some of the electrical molten salt heater pairs the length of the neighboring heater line segment connecting heaters of the pair is 2s while for others of the electrical molten salt heater pairs the length of the neighboring heater line segment connecting heaters of the pair is square root over 3 s. Averaged over all of the electrical molten salt heater pairs the average connecting line segment length is about 1.9 s.

Two heaters are neighboring molten salt heaters if i they are neighboring heaters and ii they are both molten salt heaters.

Two heaters are neighboring electrical heaters if i they are neighboring heaters and ii they are both electrical heaters.

It is noted that in all examples of heaters are arranged in inner and outer zones. However this is not a limitation and unless specified otherwise any feature related to molten salt and electrical heaters may be provide in a context other than context of nested zones.

Reference is now made to . As noted above see for example in some embodiments it is advantageous to reduce power to one or more inner zone heaters at a time when the outer zone heaters continue to operate at or near full power. This may occur for example at a particular time when most hydrocarbon fluids have been produced in the inner zone but when only a minority of hydrocarbon fluids have been produced in outer zone .

Alternatively or additionally in some embodiments it is possible e.g. at the aforementioned particular time to increase a ratio between an average power of outer zone heaters and an average power of inner zone heaters for example in response to a detected or predicted decrease in hydrocarbon fluid production in the inner zone and or in response to a detected or predicted increase in hydrocarbon fluid production in the outer zone .

As noted with reference to in some embodiments a majority of the inner zone heaters are electrical heaters while a majority of the outer zone heaters are molten salt heaters. As such the molten salt heaters may on average operate to a longer period of time e.g. at least twice as long as electrical heaters within a region of the subsurface formation e.g. within one or more heater cells .

Thus in some embodiments where molten salt and electrical heaters simultaneously operate it is possible to operate the molten salt heaters longer e.g. significantly longer e.g. at least twice as long as on average than electrical heaters. Alternatively or additionally it is possible to operate heaters so that molten salt and electrical heaters respond differently to a decline in production in one portion of the hydrocarbon containing subsurface formation e.g. a portion of the subsurface formation where a majority of the heaters are electrical heaters. In some embodiments it is possible to respond to this decline in production by increasing a ratio between an average power level of molten salt heaters and that of electrical heaters e.g. by reducing a power level of the electrical heaters.

The present inventors are now disclosing that this is a general concept and does not require shorter spacing between heaters and or greater concentration of heaters in a first zone relative to a second zone e.g. annular shaped second zone around a first zone and does not require inner and outer zones. In general for any generic heater pattern and or any geometry within a region of the subsurface formation where both molten salt and electrical heaters operate i electrical heaters may operate an average for a shorter amount of time relative to the molten salt heaters while ii molten salt heaters operate on average for a longer period of time.

In the example of it is possible during an earlier stage of production to produce hydrocarbon fluids including hydrocarbon gases primarily by thermal energy from electric heaters and at a later stage to produce hydrocarbon fluids by thermal energy from molten salt heaters. Hydrocarbon gases from the first stage of production may be combusted to heat molten salt e.g. in a furnace during the later stage. Optionally in some embodiments ethane and or methane is separated from other hydrocarbon gases and combusted.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to inner perimeter heaters outer perimeter heaters and OZS additional zone perimeter heaters. As discussed earlier in some embodiments the locations of the heaters determine the locations of the perimeters and by analogy of inner outer or OZS additional zones. In this case inner perimeter heaters outer perimeter heaters and OSC additional zone perimeter heaters respectively are located on perimeters .

Alternatively these perimeters may be determined by a predetermined shape e.g. a rectangle or regular hexagon or any other shape. For the latter case there is no requirement for the inner perimeter heaters to be located exactly on inner zone perimeter it is sufficient for the heater to be located near inner perimeter e.g. in a near inner perimeter location within inner zone or within outer zone . By analogy the same feature is true for outer zone perimeter or OZS additional zone perimeter .

This is illustrated in which illustrate i locations in the interior of the inner zone ii locations in inner zone that are substantially on inner zone perimeter iii locations in outer zone that are substantially on inner zone perimeter iv locations in the interior of the interior of outer zone i.e. away from both inner zone and outer zone perimeters iv locations in outer zone that are substantially on outer zone perimeter v locations outside of outer zone that are substantially on outer zone perimeter .

For each candidate location in inner zone that is substantially on inner zone perimeter a ratio between i a distance from the candidate location to a nearest location on inner zone perimeter and ii a distance from the candidate location to a centroid of inner zone i.e. the area enclosed by inner zone perimeter is at most 0.25 or at most 0.2 or at most 0.15 or at most 0.05.

For each candidate location in outer zone that is substantially on inner zone perimeter a ratio between a i distance from the candidate location to a nearest location on inner zone perimeter and ii a distance from the candidate location to a nearest location on outer zone perimeter is at most 0.25 or at most 0.2 or at most 0.15 or at most 0.05.

For each candidate location in outer zone that is substantially on outer zone perimeter a ratio between i a distance from the candidate location nearest location on outer zone perimeter and ii a distance from the candidate location to a nearest location on inner zone perimeter is at most 0.25 or at most 0.2 or at most 0.15 or at most 0.05.

For each candidate location outside of outer zone perimeter that is substantially on outer zone perimeter a ratio between i a distance from the candidate location nearest location on outer zone perimeter and ii a distance from the candidate location to a centroid of the area enclosed by outer zone perimeter is at most 1.25 or at most 1.15 or at most 1.05.

Reference is now made to . As noted above when heaters are distributed around perimeter of outer zone this means that heaters i.e. which are located on or near outer zone perimeter are present on every 90 degree sector of outer zone perimeter .

This is illustrated in . In it is possible to divide the cross area of the subsurface formation into four quadrants corresponding to four 90 degree sectors i.e. since the quotient of 360 degrees and four is 90 degrees relative to any arbitrary reference ray starting at centroid of outer zone . illustrate respective orientations of reference ray .

After the orientation of reference ray relative to the heater pattern is fixed it is possible to define the cross section of the subsurface formation relative to ray into four quadrants Q1 Q2 Q3 and Q4 . Dividing the subsurface formation into four quadrants also divides outer perimeter into four portions in these four portions are defined as i the portion of outer zone perimeter located in Q1 between points and ii the portion of outer zone perimeter located in Q2 between points and iii the portion of outer zone perimeter located in Q3 between points and iv the portion of outer zone perimeter located in Q4 between points and . Thus in these four portions are determined by four points on outer zone perimeter namely points and . In associated with a different orientation of reference ray these four portions are determined by points and all lying on outer zone perimeter .

For the present disclosure when heaters are present on every 90 degree sector of outer zone perimeter then irrespective of an orientation of a reference line relative to which four quadrants are defined i.e. for any arbitrary reference line orientation there is at least one outer perimeter heater within each of the four quadrants. This concept can be generalized to 72 degree sectors i.e. to divide the subsurface cross section into five equal portions rather than four quadrants 60 degrees sectors i.e. six equal portions or sextants and 45 degree sectors i.e. eight equal portions or octants .

Embodiments of the present invention relate to features of distances between heaters or distances between a heater and a location where distance and displacement may be used interchangeably. As noted above unless indicated otherwise any distance or displacement refers to a distance or displacement constrained within a two dimensional cross section for which a heater pattern is defined for example including but not limited to any heater pattern illustrated in .

In particular embodiments of the present invention relate to apparatus and methods whereby i due to the relatively high heater density and to the distribution of inner zone heaters throughout inner zone a significant fraction of inner zone is very close to a nearest heater ii due to the relatively low heater density and to feature whereby most outer zone heaters are arranged at or near outer perimeter a significantly smaller fraction of outer zone is very close to a nearest heater. As such the rate of production increases in the inner zone significantly faster than in the outer zone .

Referring to it is noted that a distance between heaters refers to the distance between respective heater centroids. Unless indicated otherwise a heater centroid is a centroid of the heater cross section co planar the two dimensional cross section of the subsurface where any heater pattern feature is defined. As evidenced by heater cross section is not required to be circular. As evidenced by the distance between heaters which is the distance between their respective centroids is not necessarily between the locations on the heater surface.

Some embodiments refer to a distance or displacement between a location indicated in by an X within the subsurface formation and one of the heaters. Unless indicated otherwise this distance or displacement is i the distance D within the plane defined by the two dimensional cross section of the subsurface where any heater pattern feature is defined ii the distance D between the location X and the heater centroid . In the examples of the distance between a location X and heater is defined by the distance between heater centroid and location X even for situations where the location X is within heater but displaced from heater centroid .

It is possible to define a first area ratio as a ratio between i an area enclosed by minimal area enclosing convex shape and ii an area enclosed by candidate shape . It is possible to define a second area ratio as a ratio between i an area enclosed by candidate shape and ii an area enclosed by maximum area enclosed convex shape .

For the present disclosure a candidate shape is substantially convex if one or both of these area ratios is at most a threshold value. Unless specified otherwise this threshold value is at most 1.3. In some embodiments this threshold value may be at most 1.2 or at most 1.15 or at most 1.1 or at most 1.05.

If one or both of these area ratios is at most a value X convex shape tolerance value of the candidate shape is said to be X. Thus as noted in the previous paragraphs in different embodiments the convex shape tolerance value is at most 1.2 or at most 1.15 or at most 1.1 or at most 1.05.

As noted above for the present disclosure spatial heater density is defined according to the principles of reservoir engineering. For example the heater nineteen heaters are inner zone heaters located on the inner zone perimeter or within inner zone while twelve heaters are outer zone heaters located on outer zone perimeter or within outer zone .

In the example of the radius of immediate neighboring region circles around heaters A C and G E and G i.e. all located on vertices of outer hexagon equals a the radius of immediate neighboring region circles around heaters B D and F i.e. all located halfway between adjacent vertices of outer hexagon is

For the heater pattern scheme of outer hexagon vertex heaters see for example the outer zone heaters labeled as A C E and G in are outer zone heaters are located on vertices of outer hexagon outer hexagon mid side heaters see for example the outer zone heaters labeled as B D and F in are outer zone heaters located midway between adjacent vertices of outer hexagon inner hexagon vertex heaters see for example the inner zone heaters labeled as H J L and N in are inner zone heaters are located on vertices of inner hexagon and inner hexagon mid side heaters see for example the outer zone heaters labeled as I K and M in are inner zone heaters located midway between adjacent vertices of inner hexagon .

Exactly one third of the area enclosed by respective immediate neighboring region circles centered at outer hexagon vertex heaters is within outer zone . Thus it may be said that one third of each of these heaters belong to outer zone and two thirds of each of these heaters belong to the region outside of outer zone i.e. not enclosed by outer zone perimeter .

Exactly one half of the area enclosed by respective immediate neighboring region circles centered at outer hexagon mid side heaters is within outer zone . Thus it may be said that one half of each of these heaters belong to outer zone and one half of each of these heaters belong to the region outside of outer zone i.e. not enclosed by outer zone perimeter .

Exactly one third of the area enclosed by respective immediate neighboring region circles centered at inner hexagon vertex heaters is within inner zone . Thus it may be said that one third of each of these heaters belong to inner zone and two thirds of each of these heaters belong to outer zone .

Exactly one half of the area enclosed by respective immediate neighboring region circles centered at inner hexagon mid side heaters is within inner zone and exactly one half of the area is within outer zone . Thus it may be said that one half of each of these heaters belong to outer zone and one half of each of these heaters belong to inner zone i.e. not enclosed by outer zone perimeter .

For the heater pattern of for the purposes of computing heater spatial density the total number of heaters belonging to inner zone include i seven internally located heaters located within inner zone and not on the perimeter of inner hexagon i.e. including heaters O and P ii one half of each of the six inner zone heaters located midway between adjacent vertices of the inner hexagon i.e. including heaters I K and M for a total of three heaters and iii one third of each of the six inner zone heaters located at vertices of the inner hexagon i.e. including heaters H J L and N for a total of two heaters. Thus a total of 7 3 2 12 heaters belong to inner zone for the purposes of computing heater spatial density.

For the heater pattern of for the purposes of computing heater spatial density the total number of heaters belonging to outer zone include i one half of each of the six inner zone heaters located midway between adjacent vertices of the inner hexagon i.e. including heaters I K and M for a total of three heaters ii two thirds of each of the six inner zone heaters located at vertices of the inner hexagon i.e. including heaters H J L and N for a total of four heaters iii one half of each of the six outer zone heaters located midway between adjacent vertices of the outer hexagon i.e. including heaters B D and F for a total of three heaters and iv one third of each of the six outer zone heaters located at vertices of the outer hexagon i.e. including heaters A C E and G for a total of two heaters. Thus it may be said that a total of 3 4 3 2 12 heaters belong to outer zone for the purposes of computing heater spatial density.

In the example of heaters belong to inner zone and heaters belong to outer zone . Because the area of outer zone is three times that of inner zone because the number of heaters belonging to inner and outer zones is the same the heater spatial density within inner zone may be said to be three times that of outer zone .

In general to compute a heater spatial density of any given region i.e. cross section of the subsurface one i determines for each heater in the formation within or relatively close to the given region a nearest neighboring heater distance ii for each heater determines a immediate neighboring region circle around each heater centroid i.e. having a radius equal to one half of the distance to a nearest neighboring heater iii computes for each heater in the formation a fraction of the immediate neighboring region circle located within the given region to determine the fraction i.e. between 0 and 1 of the heater belonging to the given region iv determines the total number of heaters belonging to the given region and v divides this number by the area of the given region.

In the example of exactly 16 heaters belong to inner zone and exactly 16 heaters belong to outer zone . Thus in the example of a ratio between i a heater spatial density in inner zone and ii a heater spatial density in outer zone is exactly three.

In different embodiments a spatial density ratio between a heater spatial density in inner zone and that of outer zone is at least 1.5 or at least 2 or at least 2.5 and or at most 10 or at most 7.5 or at most 5 or at most 4.

Some embodiments relate to a nearest heater to a location in the subsurface formation. In the example of location A marked with a star is closer to heater A than to any other heater. Therefore a distance to a nearest heater at location A is the distance between location A and heater A . In the example of location B marked with a cross is closer to heater B than to any other heater. Therefore a distance to a nearest heater at location B is the distance between location B and heater B. In the example of location C marked with a number symbol is closer to heater C than to any other heater. Therefore a distance to a nearest heater at location C is the distance between location C and heater C .

In the example of exactly two heaters are arranged so that Heater P is located at point 0 1 and Heater Q is located at point 2 1 . As such all locations within region K are closer to heater P than to heater Q and locations within region L are closer to heater Q than to heater P . Locations on the boundary between regions K and L are equidistant to the heaters.

Some embodiments relate to the average distance within an area of the subsurface formation or on a curve within the surface formation e.g. a closed curve such as a zone perimeter or or to a nearest heater. Each location within the area of curve LOC AREA or LOC CURVE is associated with a distance to a nearest heater or heater well this is the distance within the cross section of the subsurface formation for which a heater pattern is defined to a heater centroid within the cross section see . The heater which is the nearest heater to the location LOC AREA or LOC CURVE within the area or on the curve is not required to be located in the area AREA or curve.

Strictly speaking an area or curve of the subsurface of formation is a locus of points. Each given point of the locus is associated with a respective distance value describing a distance to a heater closest to the given point. By averaging these values over all points in the area or on the curve it is possible to compute an average distance within the area or on the curve to a nearest heater.

The average distance to a nearest heater within Region A i.e. in this case a distance to heater A situated at the original may be approximated by a distance between i a centroid of Region A i.e. the point and ii heater A . This distance is equal to approximately 0.71.

EQN. 2 is valid for a particular region illustrated in . For any arbitrary REGION of the subsurface an entirety of which is nearer to HEATER H than to any other heater the average distance to a nearest heater or AVG NHD NHD is an abbreviation for nearest heater distance is given by 

In the example of only a single heater is present i.e. Heater A situated at the origin. Region B of is bounded by the lines x 0 x 0.5 y 0 y 1. For the example of EQN 2 yields AVG NHD Region B 0.59. This may be approximated by a distance between a centroid of Region B and Heater A or 0.56.

EQN. 3 assumes that only a single heater is present in the subsurface formation. EQN. 3 may be generalized for a subsurface in which a heaters H H . . . H. . . H i.e. for any positive integer N are arranged at respective locations LOC H LOC H . . . LOC H LOC H .. In this situation any location LOC within the subsurface formation is associated with a respective nearest heater H LOC that is selected from H H . . . H. . . H. In the example of for all locations within Region K a nearest heater H LOC is Heater P situated at 0 1 . In the example of for all locations within Region L a nearest heater H LOC is Heater Q situated at 2 1 .

For location LOC within the subsurface formation a nearest heater distance NHD LOC is defined as DIST LOC H LOC a distance between the location LOC and its associated nearest heater H LOC . Thus EQN. 3 may be generalized as 

For the example of four heaters are arranged in the subsurface formation Heater A situated at the origin Heater B situated at 0 2 Heater C situated at 2 2 and Heater D situated at 2 0 . In this example it is desired to compute the average heater distance within Region C defined by all locations enclosed by the four lines x 0 x 2 y 0 y 2. Region C may be divided into four sub regions A1 A4 . For any location LOC in sub region A1 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater B . For any location LOCin sub region A3 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater A . For any location LOCin sub region A2 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater C . For any location LOCin sub region A4 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater D .

By symmetry it is clear that the average distance to a nearest heater within Region C AVG NHD REGION C of is identical to the average distance to a nearest heater within Region A AVG NHD REGION A of or 0.765.

For the example of five heaters are arranged in the subsurface formation Heater A situated at the origin Heater B situated at 0 2 Heater C situated at 2 2 Heater D situated at 2 0 and Heater E situated at 1 1 . In this example it is desired to compute the average heater distance within Region C defined by all locations enclosed by the four lines x 0 x 2 y 0 y 2. Region C may be divided into eight sub regions B1 B8 . For any location LOCin sub region B1 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater B . For any location LOCin sub region B2 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater E . For any location LOCin sub region B3 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater E . For any location LOCin sub region B4 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater C .

For any location LOCin sub region B5 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater A . For any location LOCin sub region B6 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater E . For any location LOCin sub region B7 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater E . For any location LOCin sub region B8 a nearest heater H LOC is Heater D .

By symmetry it is clear that the average distance to a nearest heater within Region C AVG NHD REGION C of is identical to the average distance to a nearest heater within Region B AVG NHD REGION B of or 0.59.

In the example of there are four corner heaters and a fifth more central heater E situated exactly in the center of the square shaped region. In the example of there are also four corner heaters however the fifth more central heater E is situated on the center of one of the square sides rather than in the center of the square. The heater density for both the example of A and of B is identical. However the average distance to a nearest heater in the example of is about 0.68 or about 15 greater than that of the example of . This is due to the less uniform distribution of heaters within Region C in the example of .

The aforementioned examples relate to the average distance to a nearest heater within an area of the sub formation formation. It is also possible to compute the average distance to a nearest heater for any set of points for example along a line or along a curve or along the perimeter of a polygon.

In the example of i.e. in this example exactly one heater is situated in the subsurface formation the average distance to a nearest heater along the perimeter of region A is given by 

where location LOC is a location on Curve C. One example of a Curve is inner zone or outer zone perimeters .

Because a significant number of heaters are located throughout inner zone the fraction of inner zone that is shaded is significant e.g. at least 30 or at least 40 or at least 50 or at least 60 or at least 70 of the area of inner zone . Because a significant number of heaters are located around an entirety of inner perimeter the fraction of inner perimeter that is shaded is significant e.g. at least 30 or at least 40 or at least 50 or at least 60 or at least 70 of the length of inner perimeter . In contrast due to the much lower heater density in outer zone a much smaller fraction of outer zone is shaded.

In the example of it is shown that when the threshold distance is increased from a first to a second threshold distance the portion of the outer perimeter that is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by at most the second threshold distance is significant e.g. at least 30 or at least 40 or at least 50 or at least 60 or at least 70 of the length of outer perimeter .

In one example the area of the circle defining locations e.g. see the shaded circles of within the subsurface formation i.e. in the plane in which a heater pattern is defined is exactly 5 of the area of inner zone . In this case the radius of inner zone equals

Embodiments of the present invention relate to apparatus and methods whereby for a cross section of the subsurface formation and for a threshold length or threshold distance that is equal to one eighth of the area of inner zone i a significant fraction of inner zone is covered by the shaded circles having a radius equal to the threshold distance and an area equal to about 5 of the area of inner zone ii only a significantly smaller fraction of outer zone is covered by the shaded circles having a radius equal to the same threshold distance due to the much lower heater density. In some embodiments a significant fraction of the length of inner perimeter is covered by shaded circles. In some embodiments for a second threshold distance equal to twice the aforementioned threshold distance e.g. equal to one quarter of the square root of the area of inner zone a significant fraction of the length of outer perimeter is covered by shaded circles.

In one example it is possible to set a threshold distance or threshold length to one eighth of the area of inner zone so that a magnitude of an area enclosed by a circle whose radius is the threshold distance is equal to 5 of that of the inner zone .

According to this threshold distance for the heater patterns illustrated in i more than 50 for example about 60 of inner zone is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by less than this threshold distance and ii a much smaller fraction i.e. about 15 20 of outer zone is displaced by less than this threshold distance. For the example of according to this threshold distance i well over two thirds of inner zone is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by less than this threshold distance and ii a much smaller fraction about a third of outer zone is heater displaced by less than this threshold distance.

In both examples a ratio between i a fraction of inner zone that is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by at most the threshold distance and ii a fraction of outer zone that is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by at most the threshold distance is at least 1.2 or at least 1.25 or at least 1.3 or at least 1.4 or at least 1.5 or at least 1.6 or at least 1.8 or at least 1.9.

In the example of about 60 of a length of inner perimeter is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by at most this threshold distance and about 60 of a length of outer perimeter is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by at most twice this threshold distance. In some embodiments over 75 of a length of inner perimeter is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by at most this threshold distance and over 75 of a length of outer perimeter is heater displaced or heater centroid displaced by at most twice this threshold distance.

An in situ conversion process ICP may be monitored using a feedback control process feedforward control process or other type of control process. Conditions within a formation may be monitored and used within the feedback control process. A formation being treated using an in situ conversion process may undergo changes in mechanical properties due to the conversion of solids and viscous liquids to vapors fracture propagation e.g. to overburden underburden water tables etc. increases in permeability or porosity and decreases in density moisture evaporation and or thermal instability of matrix minerals leading to dehydration and decarbonation reactions and shifts in stable mineral assemblages .

No. 4 879 696 issued to Kostelnicek et al. and U.S. Statutory Invention Registration H1561 to Thompson describe seismic sources for use in active acoustic monitoring of subsurface geophysical phenomena. A time lapse profile may be generated to monitor temporal and areal changes in a hydrocarbon containing formation. In some embodiments active acoustic monitoring may be used to obtain baseline geological information before treatment of a formation. During treatment of a formation active and or passive acoustic monitoring may be used to monitor changes within the formation.

Simulation methods on a computer system may be used to model an in situ process for treating a formation. Simulations may determine and or predict operating conditions e.g. pressure temperature etc. products that may be produced from the formation at given operating conditions and or product characteristics e.g. API gravity aromatic to paraffin ratio etc. for the process. In certain embodiments a computer simulation may be used to model fluid mechanics including mass transfer and heat transfer and kinetics within the formation to determine characteristics of products produced during heating of the formation. A formation may be modeled using commercially available simulation programs such as STARS THERM FLUENT or CFX. In addition combinations of simulation programs may be used to more accurately determine or predict characteristics of the in situ process. Results of the simulations may be used to determine operating conditions within the formation prior to actual treatment of the formation. Results of the simulations may also be used to adjust operating conditions during treatment of the formation based on a change in a property of the formation and or a change in a desired property of a product produced from the formation.

Method may include assessing at least one process characteristic of the in situ process using simulation method on the computer system. At least one process characteristic may be assessed as a function of time from at least one property of the formation and at least one operating condition. Process characteristics may include but are not limited to properties of a produced fluid such as API gravity olefin content carbon number distribution ethene to ethane ratio atomic carbon to hydrogen ratio and ratio of non condensable hydrocarbons to condensable hydrocarbons gas oil ratio . Process characteristics may include but are not limited to a pressure and temperature in the formation total mass recovery from the formation and or production rate of fluid produced from the formation.

In some embodiments simulation method may include a numerical simulation method used performed on the computer system. The numerical simulation method may employ finite difference methods to solve fluid mechanics heat transfer and chemical reaction equations as a function of time. A finite difference method may use a body fitted grid system with unstructured grids to model a formation. An unstructured grid employs a wide variety of shapes to model a formation geometry in contrast to a structured grid. A body fitted finite difference simulation method may calculate fluid flow and heat transfer in a formation. Heat transfer mechanisms may include conduction convection and radiation. The body fitted finite difference simulation method may also be used to treat chemical reactions in the formation. Simulations with a finite difference simulation method may employ closed value thermal conduction equations to calculate heat transfer and temperature distributions in the formation. A finite difference simulation method may determine values for heat injection rate data.

In an embodiment a body fitted finite difference simulation method may be well suited for simulating systems that include sharp interfaces in physical properties or conditions. A body fitted finite difference simulation method may be more accurate in certain circumstances than space fitted methods due to the use of finer unstructured grids in body fitted methods. For instance it may be advantageous to use a body fitted finite difference simulation method to calculate heat transfer in a heater well and in the region near or close to a heater well. The temperature profile in and near a heater well may be relatively sharp. A region near a heater well may be referred to as a near wellbore region. The size or radius of a near wellbore region may depend on the type of formation. A general criteria for determining or estimating the radius of a near wellbore region may be a distance at which heat transfer by the mechanism of convection contributes significantly to overall heat transfer. Heat transfer in the near wellbore region is typically limited to contributions from conductive and or radiative heat transfer. Convective heat transfer tends to contribute significantly to overall heat transfer at locations where fluids flow within the formation i.e. convective heat transfer is significant where the flow of mass contributes to heat transfer .
