The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to the employer employee relationship between the Government and the Inventors.

The present invention relates to a method and device for remotely monitoring an area using a low peak power optical pump preferably for COmonitoring or borehole monitoring.

The low cost efficient monitoring of remote locations has and continues to be highly sought in the industry. For example when drilling a production or injection well for oil gas production or COstorage it is always helpful to know the location of the drill head in terms of geometry and in terms of stratigraphy. Geologic strata can vary significantly over both a basin and production field scale due to variations in depositional terrain in the past or more recent geologic activity. As the drill may be under tremendous pressure and temperatures in extreme environments it is difficult to monitor conditions during drilling or even with the drill still in the well bore. Therefore drilling operations are often suspended and the drill removed in order to examine the well bore.

In yet another example recently there has been a tremendous interest in COsequestration. Safe efficient and effective COsequestration requires a low cost reliable means for monitoring CO. Therefore new efficient and effective remote monitoring of sequestered COsolutions are highly sought as COsequestration and storage commonly encompass large and fragmented areas and are in extreme environments.

Efforts have been made to use lasers for remote monitoring. Generally a high power lasing power is produced at a local location and sent to a remote location via an optical fiber. In these systems optical fibers limit the peak power of the lasing power transferred. These systems pose a serious risk to users in the area if an optical fiber is damaged resulting in dangerous lasing power emissions in the area. Other remote monitoring technologies generate lasing power at the remote location requiring complex electronics at the remote location. An optical response is detected and analyzed directly at the remote location. These systems are prone to fluctuations in output and measurements due to changing pressures and temperatures at the remote location particularly in extreme environments for example down hole drilling.

A method and device for remotely monitoring an area using a low peak power optical pump comprising one or more pumping sources one or more lasers and an optical response analyzer. Each pumping source from the one or more pumping sources creates a pumping energy.

The one or more lasers each comprise a high reflectivity mirror a laser media an output coupler and an output lens. Each laser media is made of a material that emits a lasing power when exposed to pumping energy. The lasing power has a peak power greater than the peak power of the pumping energy. Each high reflectivity mirror is reflective to the lasing power and transmissive to said pumping energy. Each laser media is optically connected to and positioned between a corresponding high reflectivity mirror and output coupler along a pumping axis. Each output coupler is optically connected to a corresponding output lens along the pumping axis. In various embodiments one or more coupling lens are used to couple the various optical components. The high reflectivity mirror of each laser optically is optically connected to an optical pumping source from the one or more optical pumping sources via an optical connection comprising one or more first optical fibers. Preferably a first coupling lens is used to couple the output of the first optical fiber to each laser. Preferably at least one laser comprises an output lens optically connected to and between its corresponding output coupler and sample area along its pumping axis.

In a preferred embodiment at least one laser form the one or more lasers further comprise a Q switch. Each Q switch is optically connected to and positioned between the corresponding high reflectivity mirror and the corresponding optical coupler along the pumping axis of the corresponding laser. In one embodiment a Q switch is positioned between its corresponding high reflectivity mirror and laser media. In another embodiment a Q switch is positioned between its corresponding laser media and output coupler.

Each output lens is optically connected to a sample area. Each sample area is optically connected to the optical response analyzer via one or more optical fibers. Preferably the sample area is optically connected to the optical response analyzer via a response optical fiber separate and distinct from the first optical fiber. In an alternative embodiment the sample area is optically connected to the optical response analyzer via an optical path comprising at least part of said first optical fiber. The optical response analyzer preferably uses laser induced breakdown spectroscopy or RAMAN scattering to analyze the optical response.

Preferably a first coupling lens is used to couple the output of the first optical fiber to each laser. Preferably at least one laser comprises an output lens optically connected to and between its corresponding output coupler and sample area along its pumping axis.

In a preferred embodiment at least one laser from the one or more lasers further comprise a Q switch. Each Q switch is optically connected to and positioned between the corresponding high reflectivity mirror and the corresponding optical coupler along the pumping axis of the corresponding laser. In one embodiment a Q switch is positioned between its corresponding high reflectivity mirror and laser media. In another embodiment a Q switch is positioned between its corresponding laser media and output coupler.

Each output lens is optically connected to a sample area. Each sample area is optically connected to the optical response analyzer via one or more optical fibers. Preferably the sample area is optically connected to the optical response analyzer via a response optical fiber separate and distinct from the first optical fiber. In an alternative embodiment the sample area is optically connected to the optical response analyzer via an optical path comprising at least part of said first optical fiber.

In another preferred embodiment sequestered COis stored at a plurality of remote locations and pumping energy is directed to each said remote location. Preferably in this embodiment the optical response is analyzed by the optical response analyzer for a change in COconcentration.

The one or more pumping sources produce optical pumping energy preferably having low peak power preferably less than 1 000 peak Watts more preferably about 500 1 000 Watts. Preferably the peak power of the optical pumping energy is optimized depending on factors comprising the high reflectivity mirror Q switch laser media output coupler output lens desired lasing power other optical components in the system combinations thereof etc. The optical pumping energy may be a single pulse as in the preferred embodiment a continuous stream or a series of pulses. In the preferred embodiment the one or more pumping sources are each a laser diode providing optical pumping energy in the form of a single pulse having a low power less than 1 000 peak Watts .

Preferably the one or more pumping sources are positioned above ground in an ambient environment protected from changes in pressure and temperature thereby producing consistent and reliable pumping energy.

The optical response analyzer is optically connected to the sample area and receives the optical response. The optical response analyzer is preferably optically connected to the sample area via an optical fiber preferably the first optical fiber alternatively a different fiber. The optical response is analyzed preferably by analyzing various optical factors for example frequency amplitude bandwidth etc. In a preferred embodiment the optical response analyzer uses laser induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS RAMAN scattering or a combination thereof. Preferably the optical response analyzer is positioned above ground in an ambient environment protected from changes in pressure and temperature thereby minimizing interference due to changing or extreme conditions.

In one embodiment the optical response analyzer uses laser induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS . Preferably in this embodiment the lasing energy is focused to form plasma which atomizes and excites a small sample of material in the sample area generating a plasma plume thereby creating an optical response having emissions characteristic of atomic emission lines of the elements present. Further details on LIBS may be found in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 092 087 hereby fully incorporated by reference. In this embodiment the laser is preferably optimized to output one large pulse at a low repetition rate. Preferably the lasing power is focused thereby producing a high energy beam within the sampling area but not as to damage any nearby optics.

In one embodiment the optical response analyzer uses RAMAN scattering. In this embodiment the laser is preferably optimized to output a high repetition pulse train of low power pulses. Preferably in this embodiment the optical response is a processed by a monochromator preferably filtering out the lasing energy resulting in a spectral signature of the optical response which one skilled in the art can determine the presence or absence of any number of compositions e.g. by the shift in energy from the lasing energy . Further details on RAMAN scattering may be found in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 450 193 hereby fully incorporated by reference. In one embodiment RAMAN scattering analysis is performed and the laser does not include a Q switch due to a sufficient continuous wave gain. In one embodiment the optical response is fed through a frequency doubler trippler quadrupler or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the optical response is fed through a doubler to shift the optical response to the visible spectrum and then use a visible spectrometer to measure the RAMAN shift. Preferably the lasing power is slightly focused enabling more efficient coupling to the spectrometer and thereby producing a stronger shift signal.

The first coupling lens forms the lasing into the desired pattern preferably focused on the laser media. Preferably the first couplings lens is optimized for optically transparent to the pumping energy. Preferably the first coupling lens is made of a material comprising glass. . Further details on coupling lens scattering may be found in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 668 421 hereby fully incorporated by reference.

The optical fibers transport optical energy preferably with minimal attenuation to the optical energy. Preferably the first coupling lens is made of a material comprising glass.

The output lens forms the lasing into the desired pattern. For example in one embodiment LIBS analysis is performed on the sample area and the output lens focuses the lasing power into a high energy beam of a sufficiently small spot size so as to create a beam preferably about the power density or photon flux density of about 1 10W cm. Different pressures and air will require a different power density. For example at higher pressures or in liquids the breakdown requirements are significantly less. For instance if air having an AQI Air Quality Index of 49 is used about 1 10W cmof power density or photon flux density will be required. In an alternative embodiment RAMAN analysis is performed whereby the output lens focuses the lasing power into the desired shape and size sampling area.

Each laser comprises a high reflectivity mirror a laser media an output coupler and an output lens. Preferably each laser further comprises a Q switch although in some embodiments the Q switch is omitted. The Q switch is preferably Cr YAG chromium doped yttrium aluminium garnet having enough Cr such that the small signal transmission of the lasing power is in the range of 10 70 . In an alternative embodiment preferably for embodiments whereby the optical response analyzer uses RAMAN scattering the Q switch is omitted.

The laser media is preferably made of one of the plurality of materials as discussed in Koechner W. Bass M. Solid State Lasers A Graduate Text Springer New York 2003 hereby fully incorporated by reference. The laser media is preferably a doped host material preferably Glasses crystals such as oxides Oxides Gamets Vanadates and Fluorides and ceramics. The Glasses are preferably doped with Nd Er or Yb. The Oxides such as sapphire is preferably doped with Ti. The Gamets are Yttrium Aluminum Gamet YAlO YAG Gadolinium Gallium Garnet GdGaO GGG and Gadolinium Scandium Aluminum Garnet GdScAlO GSGG and are preferably doped with rare earths such as Nd Tm Er Ho Yb. The Vanadates or Yttrium Orthovanadate YVO is preferably doped with Nd. The Fluorides or Yttrium Fluoride YLiF and is preferably doped with Nd. The laser media is preferably Nd YAG neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet Nd Glass neodymium doped glass Nd YLF neodymium doped yttrium lithium fluoride Nd YVO Yttrium Vanadate Er Glass Erbium doped glass Yb YAG ytterbium doped yttrium aluminium garnet Alexandrite Ti Sapphire Titanium sapphire . In the preferred embodiment the laser media is Nd YAG having about 0.5 atomic weight of Nd which will emit lasing power at about 1064 nm. The dopant level of the laser media is intentionally low to improve the performance of the laser. Lowering the dopant concentration affects the overall output by modifying the beam overlap the absorption depth of the optical pumping energy reducing thermal lensing losses and reducing losses due to ASE Amplified Spontaneous Emission . This leads to a much more uniform pumped gain profile as well as more uniformly distributed thermal stresses which lessens the effects of thermal lensing. The reduction of dopant concentration lowers the gain of the material slightly but offers larger energy storage capacity in return. The lasing power produced by the laser media has a peak power greater than the pumping energy. Peak power is the maximum energy produced by a generation facility over a fixed period of time.

The high reflectivity mirror allows optical pumping energy emitted from the first optical fiber to pass through while reflecting the lasing power. Preferably the high reflectivity mirror is glass fused silica or sapphire having a reflective coating that is reflective to the lasing power and an anti reflective coating that is transparent to the pumping energy. More preferably the high reflectivity mirror is fused silica having a reflective coating that is reflective to the lasing power and an anti reflective coating that is transparent to the pumping energy.

The output coupler partially reflects the lasing power preferably less than 50 of the lasing power is reflected. In the current preferred embodiment the output coupler reflects about 10 50 of the lasing power.

The output lens focuses the lasing power into the high energy beam. In a preferred embodiment the lens is a convex lens having a focal point of about one centimeter inside the sample area.

The one or more pumping sources coupling optics first optical fiber and combinations thereof preferably have anti reflection coatings. The anti reflection coatings reduce the optical losses through the system and improve the transmission efficiency of the system.

In one embodiment optics are added to a first laser allowing the first laser to pass through the optical response from the sample area. Preferably in this embodiment the first laser further comprises a first lens a first mirror a second lens a second mirror a third lens a third mirror and a fourth mirror. The first mirror is optically connected to and positioned between the first lens and the second lens along its pumping axis. The high reflectivity mirror the Q switch the laser media the optical coupler and the output lens of the first laser are all positioned between the second lens and the second mirror along the pumping axis. The second mirror is optically connected to and positioned between the output lens and the third lens along the pumping axis of the first laser. The third lens optically is connected to the second mirror and the sample area along the pumping axis of the first laser. The third mirror is optically connected to the second mirror. The third mirror is optically connected to the fourth mirror. The fourth mirror is optically connected to the first mirror.

In another embodiment the lasers comprise a first laser and a second laser. Preferably this embodiment comprises a fifth and sixth mirror whereby the fifth mirror is optically connected to the high reflectivity mirror the second laser. The sixth mirror is optically connected to the fifth mirror. The sixth mirror is optically connected to the sample area. Preferably the plurality of lasers are configured to produce lasing power at the sample area at different times. In one embodiment the first laser is optically connected to a first pumping source and the second laser is optically connected to a different second pumping source. In yet another embodiment the same pumping source is optically connected to both the first laser and the second laser but a delay is produced via a longer optical fiber connection to one of the lasers. In another embodiment the output of the second laser is optically connected a fifth mirror optically connected to a sixth mirror optically connected to a seventh mirror optically connected to eight mirror optically connected to the sample area thereby causing an optical delay in the lasing power from the second laser.

In the preferred embodiment a window is placed between the output lens and the sample area. The window seals the laser and is scaled to resist any external temperature and pressure for example from within a borehole the sample area etc. Preferably the window is made of a material comprising fused silica sapphire or a combination thereof.

Alternatively all or any pair of the output lens output coupler and window may be combined. For example the output coupler and the output lens may be combined to create a output coupler lens by placing a partially reflective to the lasing power coating on the output lens. The window and the output lens may also be combined by making a suitable window material convex so as to focus the lasing power into a high energy beam. Likewise the output lens output coupler and window may all be combined into a partially reflective focusing window by making a suitable window material convex so as to focus the lasing power into a high energy beam and adding a partially reflective coating on the window.

In an alternative embodiment the positions of the laser media and the Q switch are switched see . The high reflectivity mirror is positioned adjacent to and optically connected to the laser media along a pumping axis. The laser media is adjacent to and optically connected to the Q switch along the pumping axis. The Q switch is adjacent to and optically connected to the output coupler along the pumping axis. The output coupler is adjacent to and optically connected to the output lens along the pumping axis. In an alternative embodiment preferably for embodiments whereby the optical response analyzer uses RAMAN scattering the Q switch is omitted.

In one embodiment the laser is designed to produce consecutive pulses of lasing power. In one embodiment the laser produces a train of closely spaced output pulses of lasing power which are passed through an appropriate amplifier. When a less absorbing Q switch is used the laser will produce lasing power more quickly with less intense energy then quickly recharge and fire again and again as long as the optical pump is on. The lasing power spacing is preferably optimized for the optical pump rate and the Q switch. For example a suitable Q switched laser is described in Composite All Ceramics Passively Q switched Nd YAG Cr4 YAG Monolithic Micro Laser with Two Beam Output for Multi Point Ignition N. Pavel1 2 M. Tsunekanel K. Kanehara3 and T. Taira Optics Express Vol. 19 Issue 10 pp. 9378 9384 2011 hereby fully incorporated by reference.

Preferred embodiments of lasers further comprise a submersible housing for remote deployment for example below ground. In one embodiment a water resistant housing protects the laser from underground water and pressure. In yet another embodiment the laser is constructed within or a part of a drill bit whereby analysis of the drilled area is performed.

The first laser is capable of producing lasing power to the sample area thereby producing an optical response which passes through the response optical fiber to the optical response analyzer .

The first laser comprises a high reflectivity mirror a Q switch a laser media an output coupler and an output lens . The high reflectivity mirror is positioned adjacent to and optically connected to the Q switch along a pumping axis . The Q switch is adjacent to and optically connected to the laser media along the pumping axis . In an alternative embodiment preferably for embodiments whereby the optical response analyzer uses RAMAN scattering the Q switch is omitted whereby the high reflectivity mirror is positioned adjacent to and optically connected the laser media along the pumping axis . The laser media is adjacent to and optically connected to the output coupler along the pumping axis . The output coupler is adjacent to and optically connected to the output lens along the pumping axis .

The optical pumping energy emitted from the first optical fiber passes through the high reflectivity mirror passes through the Q switch and excites the laser media . The stored excited states of the laser media spontaneously decay producing lasing power in random directions. The lasing power emitted towards the output coupler will be partially reflected back to the laser media . Preferably the output coupler will reflect less than 50 of the lasing power towards the laser media . Lasing power emitted from the laser media towards the Q switch is partially absorbed by the Q switch . Lasing power that is not absorbed by the Q switch is reflected back towards the Q switch by the high reflectivity mirror

The lasing power will reflect back and forth between the high reflectivity mirror and the output coupler . The lasing power will traverse the laser media and interact with excited Nd atoms within the laser media inducing stimulated emission where the original photons from the lasing power cause the decay of an excited state. The stimulated event produces light of the same wavelength about 1064 nm for a Nd YAG laser media phase and in the same direction as the stimulating photon. At the same time the Q switch allows a certain percentage of the incident photons to pass through unimpeded. The balance of the certain percentage of photons are absorbed within the Q switch inducing excited states. When the material of the Q switch is in an excited state it is virtually transparent to the lasing power. Therefore as more of the lasing power is absorbed effectively make the Q switch more and more transparent for a short time. This allows more lasing power to pass through and return producing more stimulated lasing power within the laser media

This process of bleaching the Q switch allows a large number of excited states to build up within the laser media until the Q switch reaches a threshold transparency. The Q switch begins to bleach exponentially and the number of photons within the laser cavity also grows exponentially. At this point the Q switch is virtually clear of losses and the large scale lasing depletes the excited states in the laser media within a few round trips. The output lasing power produced is high energy and has very short pulse width. This output lasing power is directed through the output lens and into the sample area .

The first optical pumping source is optically connected to the first laser via a first optical fiber as described above. In this embodiment first lens and the second lens optically couple the output of the first optical fiber with the first laser therefore the first coupling lens shown in and is omitted. The first lens first mirror second lens high reflectivity mirror Q switch laser media output coupler output lens second mirror third lens and sample area are positioned along a pumping axis . The first lens is adjacent and optically connected to the first mirror . The Second lens is adjacent and optically connected to the first mirror . The high reflectivity mirror is adjacent and optically connected to the first lens . The Q switch is adjacent and optically connected to the high reflectivity mirror . The laser media is adjacent and optically connected to the Q switch . The output coupler is adjacent and optically connected to the laser media . The output lens is adjacent and optically connected to output coupler . The second mirror is adjacent and optically connected to the output lens . The third lens is adjacent and optically connected to the second mirror

The second mirror is positioned whereby at least some optical response from the sample area is reflected to the third optical mirror . The third mirror is optically connected to both the second mirror and the fourth mirror . The fourth mirror is optically connected to the first mirror . The fourth mirror is positioned and constructed to reflect at least some optical response from the sample area reflected by the second mirror the third mirror and the fourth mirror towards the first lens . The optical response analyzer is optically connected to the first lens through the first optical fiber .

As the optical pumping energy passes into the first laser it passes first through the first lens through the first mirror the second lens the high reflectivity mirror and the q switch to the laser media . Lasing power produced at the laser media passes through the output coupler the second mirror and the third lens to the sample area . Any optical response from the sample area passes through the third lens the second mirror the third mirror the fourth mirror the first mirror the first lens and out the first optical fiber which is connected to optical response analyzer .

The optical distributor preferably is a rotating element preferably a lens a prism or a mirror for deflecting light at a select angle from its axis of rotation. The rotation may be continuous or stepwise. When the rotation is stepwise the optical distributor is preferably either a mirror or a lens but there is no restriction on the angle of deflection since dwell time is determined by the stepping mechanism. A shallow angle deflection is preferred since it requires much less precision in the controlling motor making for a more economical apparatus.
