title: Generation of an observer view in a virtual environment
abstract: Generation of an observer view in a virtual environment in response to real-time input during a simulation is disclosed. In one embodiment, a device initiates a simulation of a virtual environment. Core view data that identifies a core view in the virtual environment is maintained. The core view is associated with an object in the virtual environment. Core view imagery that depicts a portion of the virtual environment based on the core view data is generated. During the simulation, real-time input that includes first observer view data that identifies a first observer view in the virtual environment is received. The first observer view is unassociated with any object in the virtual environment. First observer view imagery that depicts a portion of the virtual environment based on the first observer view data is generated.
