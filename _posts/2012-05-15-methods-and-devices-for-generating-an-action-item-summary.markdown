Other example embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.

Example embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular operating system electronic device architecture server architecture or computer programming language.

Reference is first made to which illustrates an example electronic device . In the illustrated example embodiment the electronic device is a communication device such as a mobile communication device. In at least some example embodiments the electronic device is a two way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device in various example embodiments the electronic device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for data and voice communication a mobile telephone such as a smart phone a tablet computer such as a slate computer a wearable computer such as a watch a PDA personal digital assistant or a computer system.

A smartphone is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capabilities than a basic non smartphone cellular phone. For example a smartphone may have an ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.

A tablet computer which may also be referred to as a tablet is an electronic device which is generally larger than a mobile phone such as a smartphone or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized. That is mobile phones or personal digital assistants are generally small enough to be carried by a person easily often in a shirt or pant pocket while tablet computers are larger and may not fit within pant pockets. For example many tablet computers have a height which is seven inches 7 or more. In some example embodiments the tablet computer may be a slate computer. A slate computer is a tablet computer which does not include a dedicated keyboard. A slate computer may allow for text input through the use of a virtual keyboard or an external keyboard which connects to the slate computer via a wired or wireless connection.

The electronic device includes a housing not shown which houses components of the electronic device . The internal components of the electronic device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The electronic device includes a controller including at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the electronic device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including one or more input interfaces such as a keyboard one or more control buttons one or more microphones and or a touch sensitive overlay associated with a touchscreen display flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems a data port which may be a serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port one or more output interfaces such as a display one or more speakers or other output interfaces a location sensor a short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The electronic device may include a touch sensitive display which may be referred to as a touchscreen or a touchscreen display . The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller. The touch sensitive input surface overlays the touchscreen display and may be referred to as a touch sensitive overlay. The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input interface and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller. That is the touchscreen display acts as both an input interface and an output interface .

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the electronic device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter . The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which the electronic device is intended to operate.

The electronic device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

In some example embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may include an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The electronic device may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network. The auxiliary I O subsystems may include a pointing or navigational tool input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some example embodiments the electronic device also includes a removable memory module typically including flash memory and a memory module interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device via the memory module which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory module for use in the relevant wireless network. The memory module may be inserted in or connected to the memory module interface of the electronic device .

The electronic device may store data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments the data may include service data having information required by the electronic device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the electronic device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases or data stores each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the memory of the electronic device .

The data may include content . Content which is stored locally in memory of the electronic device may be referred to as stored content. Such stored content may for example include any one or combination of the following a video such as for example an MPEG video WMV video AVI video etc. an audio file such as for example an MP3 audio file a WAV audio file a RealAudio audio file etc. a word processor file such as a Microsoft Word file etc. a spreadsheet such as a Microsoft Excel file an electronic book such as an e book in an EPUB MOBI or other file format a presentation such as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation a Portable Document Format PDF document an image file such as a raster vector or 3D graphic image including for example a JPEG file TIFF file etc. . Other types of content apart from those types listed above may also be stored in memory of the electronic device .

The data may include one or more action items . As will be described in greater detail below an action item may be a record of an action that a user wishes to be reminded of. That is the action item may be a record of a future action i.e. an action that a user intends to perform in the future . More particularly the action item serves as a record for a user to remind the user that an action is required.

In at least some embodiments the action item may include context information. Context information may be information which is associated with the action item . More particularly the context information may provide context for the action item . The context information may explain the circumstances which caused the creation of the action item and or a requirement associated with the completion of the action item.

In at least some embodiments the context information may provide answers to one or more of the five Ws when who why where and what. For example the context information may include a plurality of context items each providing an answer to a different one of the five Ws. For example the context information may include a why context item which specifies a reason why the action item was created. Similarly the context information may include a who context item which specifies one or more persons associated with the action item. The person may be someone whose presence will be necessary or desirable for completion of the action item. For example completion of the action item may require discussions with the person specified in the who context item.

Similarly a when context item may specify timing information associated with the action item. For example the when context item may specify a date or time period during which the action item is to be completed. In some embodiments the timing information may specify a date or period of time when the action item is to be completed or when a reminder should be generated based on the action item. The timing information may however be specified in a less precise manner for example the timing information may be specified using imprecise terms such as soon or someday . In at least some embodiments software may associate each of these imprecise terms with a defined time period for the purposes of generating reminders. For example soon may generate a reminder a week after creation of the action item while someday may generate a reminder a month after creation of the action item.

In at least some embodiments a why context item may specify a reason why the action item was created. The why context item may be generated based on freeform input of a user in a text box. For example a user may be prompted to input information as to the reason for creating the action item. By way of example a user may input a short response such as it is interesting need to review etc. which describes their reason for creating the action item.

A where context item may be associated with the action item and may be used to specify a location associated with the action item. The location may for example be a location where the action item is to be completed or where the action item may be completed or may be a location where the user wishes to be reminded of the action item. That is the where context item may specify a location related to the action item such as a location at which the action item will become relevant .

A what context item may be associated with the action item and may be used to identify content associated with the action item. The content may be content which a user requires to complete the action. For example the content may be content which the user wishes to view read or listen to. The content may be any of the content described above or other content. By way of example the content may be a video audio file word processing document etc. In some embodiments the content may be a web page which may be clipped using a web clipper and stored locally in memory of the electronic device .

As will be described in greater detail below these context items may act as reminder conditions for the action item . That is reminders may be generated based on the context items.

The action item may not include the content itself. Rather the action item may include a link or reference to the content . This link or reference allows the content to be accessed when accessing the action item .

The data port may be used for synchronization with a user s host computer system not shown . The data port enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device through a direct reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.

In some example embodiments the electronic device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the electronic device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

The electronic device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the electronic device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the short range communication subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

The location sensor is configured to determine a geographic location of the electronic device . That is the location sensor may be configured to act as a positioning system to determine the location of the electronic device in space. In some embodiments the location sensor may be a global positioning system GPS sensor which is configured to determine a location using satellites. The location sensor may take other forms in other embodiments. For example the location sensor may determine location through triangulation by measuring the strength and direction of signals from two or more nearby cell phone towers.

A pre determined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the electronic device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to an operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the electronic device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable device subsystems . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime.

In some example embodiments the electronic device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or a web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the touchscreen display . A user of the electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices such as the touchscreen display . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the electronic device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. a voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the touchscreen display may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules include operating system software and software applications such as a manager application and or a web browser application .

As will be described in greater detail below in at least some embodiments the manager application is configured to create and manage action items . For example the manager application may be configured to generate context information and or to prompt users to input context information associated with an action item . Methods of creating and or using action items will be described in greater detail below with reference to .

In at least some embodiments the manager application is configured to trigger reminders e.g. to generate an audible visual or vibratory alert based on such context information.

Accordingly the context information of an action item may specify reminder conditions associated with that action item . The reminder conditions may specify conditions which cause a reminder of the action item to be triggered. In at least some embodiments some or all these reminder conditions may be based on one or more of the context items referred to above. For example any of the what context item the when context item the where context item or the who context item may act as a basis for a reminder condition. For example the what context item may be used generate a reminder when content associated with an action item is being accessed and or consumed. For example if an action item is created based on content such as a video if the same content is accessed sometime later the reminder may be triggered.

Similarly timing information specified by a when context item of an action item may be used to generate a reminder. For example timing information specified by a when context item may specify a deadline for an associated action item and a reminder may be triggered based on the deadline for example when the deadline has expired and or when the deadline is imminent.

Similarly a location specified by a where context item of an action item may be used to generate a reminder. For example when a user is currently in a location specified by a where context item a reminder may be triggered. Similarly in some embodiments if the electronic device determines that a user has planned to be in the location specified in a where context item a reminder may be triggered.

Similarly a person or persons specified by a who context item of an action item may be used to generate a reminder. In at least some embodiments the electronic device may attempt to identify possible interactions with the person or persons specified in a who context item and may trigger a reminder when a possible interaction is identified. Specific methods of identifying possible interactions will be discussed below.

Accordingly in at least some embodiments a single action item may have two or more reminder conditions associated therewith. For example two or more of the context items referred to above i.e. where who what when may be treated as reminder conditions. In some embodiments the manager application may be configured to trigger a reminder when a plurality of conditions associated with reminder conditions are found to exist i.e. some reminder conditions taken alone may not trigger a reminder the reminder may only be triggered when that condition and another reminder condition are found to exist . For example in at least some embodiments the reminder conditions specified in the who and where context items may need to exist together before a reminder will be triggered for example the reminder may be triggered if the location of the electronic device corresponds to that specified in the where context item and an interaction with the person specified in the who context item is identified .

In other embodiments in which a single action item may be associated with multiple reminder conditions the manager application may be configured to trigger the reminder when a single one of those conditions is determined to exist.

In some embodiments the manager application may be configured to automatically generate a summary of an action item based on the context information for that action item . For example in at least some embodiments the manager application may be configured to automatically generate a sentence summarizing the action item based on the context information. This sentence may be displayed when displaying the action item and or when displaying a reminder based on the action item .

In at least some embodiments the manager application or another application may include a sharing framework which allows action items to be created from within other applications. The sharing framework may for example include an application programming interface API which allows other applications to access features or functions of the manager application . By way of example the sharing framework may allow a user of another application such as the web browser to create an action item based on content associated with the other application. For example a user of the web browser may activate the sharing framework to create an action item based on a web page displayed within the web browser . In response the sharing framework of the manager application may clip the web page and may store a representation of the web page locally on the electronic device and may create an action item based on the web page.

Specific functions and features of the manager application will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .

In at least some example embodiments the operating system may perform some or all of the functions of the manager application . In other example embodiments the functions or a portion of the functions of the manager application may be performed by one or more other applications. Further while the manager application has been illustrated as a single block the manager application may include a plurality of software modules. In at least some example embodiments these software modules may be divided among multiple applications.

The electronic device may include a range of additional software applications including for example a notepad application a word processing application an image viewing and or editing application a calendar application an address book application a mapping application or a media player application such as a video player and or an audio player or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the touchscreen display according to the application. In at least some example embodiments the software applications may include pre determined gesture information defining functionalities associated with the pre determined gestures received via the touchscreen display . For example a software application may determine a finger swiping movement i.e. a pre determined gesture on the touchscreen display as a scrolling function.

The software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

The following discussion will refer to example methods for creating action items . Reference will be made to various example display screens to facilitate understanding of the example methods. The methods may in at least some embodiments be performed by the manager application . More particularly the manager application and or another application may contain computer readable instructions which when executed cause the processor of the electronic device to perform the methods described below. The computer readable instructions may be configured to cause the processor to generate one or more screens having the features described below.

Referring now to an example method for creating an action item is illustrated. The features of the method will be discussed with reference to the example screens of .

At input requesting creation of an action item may be received at the electronic device . The input may for example be received via an input interface associated with the electronic device such as a touchscreen display .

In some embodiments the input may be received from within an application which is not the manager application . That is another application may currently be operating and a user interface screen associated with that application may be displayed on the display of the electronic device when the request to create the action item is received. For example a user may input a request to create an action item within another application by performing a predetermined gesture within that application. In at least some embodiments the input may be received from within a content access application. The content access application may be any application for accessing content such as the content described above with reference to . By way of example in various embodiments the content access application may be any one of a notepad application a word processing application an image viewing and or editing application a calendar application an address book application a mapping application or a media player application such as a video player and or an audio player . When a request to create an action item is received within a content access application it may be interpreted as a request to create an action item based on specific content such as content which is currently displayed by the content access application and or content which is stored locally on the electronic device .

In some example embodiments the input requesting creation of an action item may be received from within a web browser . Referring now to one such example embodiment is illustrated. illustrates an example web browser screen which may be displayed on the display of the electronic device . The web browser screen includes a web page display pane and controls for controlling the web browser . The controls include an address bar which allows for the input and display of an address associated with a web page which may be displayed within the web page display pane .

The web browser or other content access application is configured to permit a request to create an action item to be received. In the example embodiment illustrated the web browser is configured to utilize the address bar for this purpose. A touch or tap gesture at the address bar may be interpreted by the web browser as a request to create an action item based on a displayed web page if the touch or tap gesture persists for a period which exceeds a predetermined threshold if a touch or tap is received which does not persist for the period which exceeds the predetermined threshold then it may be interpreted as another command such as a command to select or edit the contents of the address bar .

In some embodiments the input received within the content access application may not directly cause the creation of an action item . Instead further input may be received. For example in some embodiments the input received from within the content access application such as the gesture received within the web browser described with reference to may cause a further screen to be displayed on the display . Referring now to the further screen may include a selectable option to engage a sharing framework associated with the electronic device and or the manager application . In the example illustrated the selectable option to engage the sharing framework is a selectable command button labeled share. 

The sharing framework in at least some embodiments may allow content to be shared in a number of different ways. That is the sharing framework may allow a number of different sharing services to be accessed to share the content. For example the sharing framework may in at least some embodiments be configured to allow content to be shared with others via electronic mail e.g. send an email with the content or a link to the content . The sharing framework may also allow content to be shared with the manager application . Other methods of sharing may also be provided by the sharing framework.

Accordingly when the sharing framework is engaged e.g. when a user selects the selectable option to share content which is currently displayed or otherwise accessed by the content access application a further display screen illustrated in may be displayed which includes a selectable option to select a sharing service to be used. In the example illustrated this selectable option takes the form of a drop down box which lists the sharing services which are available. One of the sharing services which is available is an option to share the content with the manager application in the example illustrated the manager application is referred to as FocalPoint . In this example the option to share the content with the manager application acts as a request to create an action item . That is when a user selects the option to share the content with the manager application the sharing framework may interpret this as a request to create an action item based on the content. Thus of the method may be performed when a user selects the option to share the content with the manager application .

It will be appreciated that the request to create an action item may be received in other ways apart from those described above with reference to . For example in some embodiments the request may be received directly through the manager application e.g. instead of through another application such as a content access application . One such example is illustrated in . The manager application may for example be launched and a display screen associated with the manager application displayed on the display . The display screen may include a selectable option for inputting a request to create an action item . In the example illustrated the selectable option takes the form of an interface element labeled Add Action .

Referring again to after the input requesting creation of an action item is received in some embodiments at the manager application may obtain a container assignment for the action item .

A container which may also be referred to as a bucket or FocalPoint is an organizational construct which may be used to group related action items . Containers may be user defined. That is a user may determine a name for a container and may select the action items to be assigned to a container. Each container may be used to link action items so that a user may easily view related action items together. The containers may define a context where the user expects to perform the action item .

A container may for example be used to group items which will become relevant to a user at the same time. For example one container an emails to follow up container may be used to group action items created based on email messages that require follow up. That is the emails to follow up container tracks email messages that a user would like to follow up on e.g. by responding to the emails . This way when the user has time to attend to such emails they can easily access all emails which require follow up thereby realizing an efficiency.

Similarly a grocery list container may be used to group action items which relate to groceries that a user wishes to purchase. The grocery list container may for example store recipes which the user wishes to use. By storing such action items within a grocery list container the user may access all action items such as the recipes in the container when they are at a grocery store.

Similarly a ride home container may be used to group action items which a user wishes to address when they are commuting.

It will be appreciated that the list of containers described herein is not intended to be exhaustive and that other containers may be used instead of or in addition to the containers described herein.

In at least some embodiments after input requesting creation of the action item is received at a user interface may be provided on the electronic device which is configured to allow a user to assign the action item to a container. For example referring again to an example of one such user interface is illustrated. The display screen of includes a selectable option to assign the action item to a container. The selectable option may in at least some embodiments be configured to allow for selection of an existing container. The selectable option may also allow a user to define a new container.

Referring again to after the input requesting creation of an action item is received the manager application may at obtain context information associated with the action item .

Context information may be information which is associated with the action item and which lends context to the action item . The context information may include information regarding circumstances which caused the creation of the action item and or requirement s associated with the completion of the action item. The context information may include one or more context items. Context items may provide different types of context information i.e. information of different context types . In some embodiments each context item may define context information of a separate context type. By way of example in at least some embodiments the context information may provide answers to one or more of the five Ws when who why where and what. A why context item may specify a reason why the action item is to be or has been created a who action item may specify one or more persons associated with the action item a when context item may specify timing information associated with the action item a where context item may specify one or more locations associated with the action item and a what context item may identify content associated with the action item. These context items are explained in greater detail above in the discussion of .

In at least some embodiments after input requesting creation of the action item is received at a user interface may be provided on the electronic device which may allow a user to input such context information. For example referring again to an example of a display screen which allows for input of context information is illustrated. The display screen includes interface elements for receiving input specifying context information. The interface elements may act as prompts prompting a user to input specific types of context information.

In the embodiment of an interface element allows a user to input timing information associated with a when context item. The interface element may prompt a user to input such timing information. For example in the embodiment illustrated the interface element includes a label When to indicate to user that the interface element may be used for inputting timing information associated with the action item.

As noted previously in some cases the timing information may identify a deadline for the action item . In the example illustrated a drop down box is used to allow a user to input such timing information. In the embodiment illustrated the interface element allows a user to input imprecise timing information associated with the context item. Such imprecise timing information may specify an imprecise time period for completing the action item. For example the interface element may allow a user to select any one or combination of the following soon someday far off ASAP yesterday now . In at least some embodiments such imprecise terms may be associated with more precise time periods in memory for the purposes of generating reminders. That is imprecise timing information may be mapped to more precise timing information. By way of example soon may be mapped to a time period of one week so that after a week has elapsed a reminder is generated based on the action item .

In some embodiments more precise timing information may be input by a user. For example in some embodiments the interface element may allow a user to specify a precise time period such as for example one day two days one week one month etc. . In some embodiments the interface element may allow a user to specify a calendar date which may be specified in terms of a day month and or year.

In at least some embodiments the when context item is a required context item. That is in at least some embodiments the when context information may be required to be populated. In at least some embodiments when no input is received to specify timing information for the when context item then the when context item may be populated with default timing information. By way of example in some embodiments the default timing information may specify that the action item is to be completed someday. 

The example display screen shown in also includes an interface element for receiving input specifying other context information. For example the display screen may allow a user to input information associated with a why context item a where context item and or a who context item.

In at least some embodiments a prompt may be displayed requesting a user to input specific types of context information. For example the display screen may prompt a user to input a reason why an action item is was created i.e. to input information for the why context item . In response to the prompt a user may specify context information indicating a reason why the action item is was created. In at least some embodiments a freeform text field may be provided for a user to input the information for the why context item. The freeform text field may allow a user a large amount of flexibility when specifying the reason for example a user may specify any reason which the user wishes to specify subject to possible character length constraints and or character type constraints associated with the freeform text field.

In at least some embodiments a display screen may prompt a user to input context information specifying one or more persons associated with the action item i.e. to input information for the who context item . In response to the prompt a user may specify context information indicating the person s associated with the action item. These persons may for example be persons whose presence is required to complete the action item. In at least some embodiments the manager application may connect to an address book application associated with the electronic device and or associated with the user to allow a user to select a person having a contact record in an existing address book accessible to the electronic device . That is the user interface provided by the manager application may allow a user to rely on existing contact records when specifying one or more persons associated with the action item . For example a list of contact records may be displayed and a user may be permitted to select from the list.

In at least some embodiments a display screen may prompt a user to input context information specifying one or more locations associated with the action item i.e. to input information for the where context item . In response to the prompt a user may specify context information indicating a location associated with the action item. For example the location may be a location where the user intends to complete the action item. The location may be specified in terms of a geographic location e.g. a city street address country etc. or may be specified in more imprecise terms e.g. by specifying that the location is home or work Imprecise locations such as home and work may be associated with more precise locations in memory. For example the memory may store a home address and or a work address so that when a user selects home or work the manager application is able to determine a more precise location to be associated with the action item for the purpose of generating reminders.

In the embodiment illustrated in the display screen includes a single interface element which is used for inputting context information for the who context item the where context item and the why context item. Activation of this interface element may cause further display screen to be displayed which may contain further interface elements for inputting context information. For example in some embodiments activation of the interface element may cause a further screen to be displayed which includes separate interface elements for inputting context information for each of the why where and who context items. The use of a shared interface element on the display screen may be useful due to screen size constraints of the display .

Other context information may be obtained instead of or in addition to the context information discussed above i.e. the who where when and why context items . For example in some embodiments a what context item may be obtained. The what context item may define an object which is associated with the action item . The object may be a material or virtual thing that can be seen or touched. By way of example the what context may be used to identify content associated with the action item . The content may be content which a user requires to complete the action. For example the content may be content which the user wishes to view read or listen to. By way of example the content may be a video audio file word processing document etc. In some embodiments the content may be a web page which may be clipped using a web clipper and stored for example locally in memory of the electronic device .

In at least some embodiments the what context item may be populated with a link to the content associated with the action item and or a brief description of the content. The link or brief description may in at least some embodiments be automatically generated. For example when the input requesting creation of an action item of is received from within a content access application the what context item may be populated based on the content which was active in the content access application at the time of the request. For example when a request to create the action item is received from within a web browser the what context item may be populated based on the web page displayed on the display immediately prior to the request. In at least some such embodiments the web page may be clipped i.e. a representation of the web page may be stored in local memory and the action item may be associated with or may include the clipped web page.

In at least some embodiments the action item may be populated with an item of content stored on the electronic device such as a video image etc. However in other embodiments the actual item of content may not be included in the action item . Instead a link or reference to existing content i.e. content already stored in local memory may be automatically included in the action item . The link or reference allows the content to be accessed when the action item is accessed but reduces memory redundancies by not storing the content both in the action item and elsewhere in memory.

As noted above in at least some embodiments some of the context information for an action item may be automatically generated. As noted above in some embodiments context information may be automatically generated for the what context item. Similarly other types of context information may be automatically generated. For example in some embodiments context information for the who context item may be automatically generated. By way of example when a request to create an action item is received while an electronic communication is displayed on the display the who context item may be automatically populated based on a sender or recipient associated with that electronic communication. For example if an email is displayed immediately before a request to create an action item is received then the who context item may be populated with a contact who sent the email.

Referring again to in at least some embodiments after the context information is obtained at at the manager application may create the action item . The action item may be created for example by storing the action item in memory of the electronic device . That is in at least some embodiments the action item including the context information described above may be stored in memory such as a memory of the electronic device .

In at least some embodiments after the action item is created user interface focus on the electronic device may return to the application which was active on the electronic device during or immediately before the request to create the action item was received. For example the application which was displayed prior to the receipt of the request to create the action item may again be displayed. By way of further example if receipt of the request was received while a content access application such as a web browser was displayed as described above with reference to then the content access application may again be displayed after creation of the action item.

The following discussion will refer to example methods for accessing action items . Reference will be made to various display screens to facilitate understanding of the example methods. The methods may in at least some embodiments be performed by the manager application . More particularly the manager application and or another application may contain computer readable instructions which when executed cause the processor of the electronic device to perform the methods described below. The computer readable instructions may be configured to cause the processor to generate one or more screens having the features described below.

Referring now to an example method for accessing an action item is illustrated. The features of the method will be discussed with reference to the example screens of .

In at least some embodiments the manager application is configured so that after an action item is created that action item may be accessed from within the manager application . For example the manager application may be launched at on the electronic device using any one of a number of techniques. For example an icon associated with the manager application may be selected on a user interface provided by the electronic device s operating system causing the manager application to be launched.

After the manager application is launched at a display screen may be displayed on the display which lists available containers. Referring briefly to an example of one such display screen is illustrated. The display screen lists a plurality of selectable containers . These containers may be containers to which action items were previously assigned according to the method described above with reference to of . In some embodiments the containers may identify the number of items contained in the container and or may indicate whether there are any overdue action items in the container. In the embodiment illustrated the containers specify the number of overdue action items in the container.

In the embodiment illustrated the display screen also includes a selectable option to display all action items . Selection of the selectable option to display all action items may cause the electronic device to display a list of all action items irrespective of the containers which those action items are assigned to.

Referring again to after the list of available containers is displayed at at the electronic device may receive a selection of one of the containers. In response at the electronic device may display a list of action items contained in the selected container. Referring now to an example of one such list is illustrated. illustrates a display screen which includes a list of action items contained in a selected container . In the example illustrated the selected container is a Train Ride Home container. In the embodiment illustrated the list includes a short description of the action item and also includes check boxes which allow a user to mark action items as completed. In at least some embodiments when an action item is marked completed it is moved to the bottom of the list. In other embodiments when an action item is marked completed it is removed from the list.

In the example illustrated the action items are ordered according to urgency. That is they are ordered according to the deadline associated with the action item i.e. they are ordered based on the timing information in the when context item . Overdue items are listed more prominently than items with a longer deadline.

The list of action items may be sorted according to other criteria in other embodiments. For example the list may be sorted according to information contained in the who context item to allow a user to view action items which are grouped according to the persons associated with those action items. Similarly the list may be sorted according to information contained in the where context item to allow a user to view action items which are grouped according to the location associated with those action items. Similarly the list may be sorted according to information contained in the what context item to allow a user to view action items which are grouped according to the content associated with those action items.

In at least some embodiments the sorting of the list may be user defined. That is a user may specify how they would like the list to be sorted.

Referring again to in at least some embodiments after the list of action items is displayed at a selection of an action item may be received at . In response to receiving such a selection the manager application may automatically display at or otherwise output content associated with the action item . Referring briefly to an example of a display screen which displays content associated with a selected action item is illustrated. In the example illustrated the selected action item is associated with email content. Accordingly the email associated with the action item is displayed on the display . In the example illustrated the content associated with the action item is displayed together with a summary of the action item . In this example the summary is a single sentence which is automatically generated based on the content information for the action item. Methods of generating such a summary will be described in greater detail below.

In at least some embodiments context information associated with an action item such as the who what where why and when context items may be used for the purposes of generating reminders. Such reminders may be useful for example to increase the likelihood that a user will perform a task associated with an action item and or to allow a user to perform the task at an opportune time.

In at least some embodiments the manager application may be configured to utilize one or more of the context items such as the who what where why and when context items as reminder conditions and to trigger a reminder based on these reminder conditions.

Referring now to a flowchart of an example method of triggering a reminder based on such reminder conditions is illustrated. The method may in at least some embodiments be performed by the manager application . More particularly the manager application and or another application may contain computer readable instructions which when executed cause the processor of the electronic device to perform the method described below.

The method includes various operations and features which were described above with reference to the method of . To avoid repetition similar numerals have been used to indicate the same or similar features or operations of the methods and . Accordingly such operations and features may operate as described above with reference to .

First at input is received requesting creation of an action item. Such input may be received in the manner described above with reference to . At a container assignment for the action item is obtained. This container assignment may be obtained in the manner described above with reference to .

At context information associated with the action item is obtained. may be performed as described above with reference to and at an action item may be created in the manner described above with reference to . At a reminder of the action item may be triggered based on the reminder conditions.

In some embodiments the context information may specify reminder conditions for the action item. Reminder conditions are conditions which are used to trigger a reminder of the action item . In at least some embodiments one or more of the reminder conditions may be context items of the type described above i.e. who what where why and when context items may be treated as reminder conditions . For example a reminder condition may be based on a when context item which identifies a deadline for completing the action item. In such embodiments a reminder may be triggered based on the deadline for example if the deadline expires and or if a deadline is approaching a reminder may be triggered. For example if the timing information specifies a time period for completing the action item then after the time period has elapsed if the action item is not marked completed a reminder may be triggered.

Similarly in some embodiments a reminder condition may be based on a who context item. The who context item may specify a contact such as a person known to the user of the electronic device who is to be involved in completing the action item. In such embodiments the manager application may trigger a reminder based on the who context item by identifying possible interactions with that contact and by triggering a reminder when actual or possible interactions with that contact are identified.

Such interactions may be identified for example using a location sharing service. A location sharing service is a service which shares location information specifying a contact s current or future location. By way of example the location sharing service may be Foursquare . In at least some such embodiments the manager application may determine whether an interaction with the contact is possible or likely based on the location of the contact provided by the location sharing service. In at least some embodiments the manager application may determine whether the contact is close to the electronic device . This determination may be made by comparing a location of the electronic device which may be obtained from a location sensor such as a GPS sensor with the location of the contact as provided by the location sharing service. If the electronic device is determined to be sufficiently close to the contact then the reminder may be triggered.

The determination regarding whether the electronic device is sufficiently close to the contact may be made by comparing the distance between the electronic device and the contact s location to a threshold. This threshold need not be the same for all contacts. More specifically in some embodiments the threshold used will depend on established norms for the contact. More specifically if the contact is typically very far from the electronic device e.g. if the contact and the user of the device live and work in different cities than one another then the threshold may be higher than if the contact is typically relatively close to the electronic device . Accordingly the determination regarding whether the contact and the electronic device are sufficiently close to one another to trigger a reminder may be based on established norms. Using this technique a reminder for an action item associated with an out of town contact may be triggered when that contact is in town but a reminder for an action item associated with a co worker who works near the user of the electronic device may not be triggered when that co worker is in town. Instead for the co worker the threshold may be much smaller before the reminder is triggered.

In other embodiments instead of relying on a location sharing service to determine whether the contact is sufficiently close to the electronic device to trigger the reminder the manager application may rely on an address such as a home address or work address associated with the contact which is defined in a contact record for that contact. More specifically the electronic device may identify its own current position using the location sensor and may identify an address associated with the contact from a contact record for that contact. The electronic device may then identify a possible interaction based on the current position of the electronic device and the address. More specifically the manager application may determine whether the electronic device is currently sufficiently close to the address. This determination may be made for example by comparing the distance between the electronic device and the contact s address to a threshold. As noted above the threshold need not be the same for all contacts and may be based on established norms i.e. typical distances between the electronic device and the address . If the electronic device is determined to be sufficiently close to the address the reminder may be triggered.

In some embodiments the manager application may identify possible interactions with the contact by identifying planned travel to a region associated with the contact. For example the manager application may scan emails received at the electronic device and may identify emails which contain travel itinerary information. Such emails may for example specify hotel reservation information flight information or other types of reservation information. When travel is planned to a region associated with the contact such as a city where the contact resides then the reminder may be triggered.

In at least some embodiments the manager application may not itself scan emails to identify travel information. Instead the manager application may rely on another application such as Blackberry Travel which reviews such emails and which identifies trips and shares such information with the manager application .

In some embodiments the manager application may identify planned travel to a region associated with the contact by comparing a destination address input into a navigation application such as Google Maps or another mapping application which provides navigation functions to an address or location associated with the contact. For example when a user requests directions to a location which is near the contact s location or address then a reminder may be triggered.

Other techniques may be used to identify actual or possible interactions with the contact associated with the action item. For example in at least some embodiments the manager application may monitor a calendar and may identify a possible interaction with the contact if an appointment is scheduled with that contact. When such an appointment is identified a reminder may be triggered.

Similarly in at least some embodiments the manager application may monitor communications on the electronic device and may trigger the reminder if a communication with the contact associated with the action item is identified. For example when a phone call is placed to or received from the contact the reminder may be triggered. Where an email is being composed to the contact i.e. if the contact is listed as a recipient then the reminder may be triggered. If a text message is composed to the contact then the reminder may be triggered. If an instant messaging conversation is occurring with the contact then the reminder may be triggered.

In some embodiments a reminder condition which is used to trigger a reminder may be based on a where context item which specifies a location associated with the action item. That is a reminder condition used to trigger a reminder may comprise a location associated with the action item. In at least some such embodiments a reminder may be triggered based on the location associated with the action item and also based on the current or future location of the electronic device and or its user . For example the reminder may be triggered when the electronic device or the user is determined to be close to the location associated with the action item or may be triggered when the user is planning on being close to the location.

The current or future location of the electronic device or the user may be determined according to any of the methods described above. More specifically a location sensor may be utilized or planned travel may be identified by scanning emails or by monitoring requests for directions in a navigation application. The determination as to whether the electronic device is currently or is expected to be close enough to the location associated with the action item to cause the reminder to be triggered may be made using one or more thresholds e.g. if the current or planned distance between the device and the location is less than a threshold then the reminder may be triggered . These thresholds may not be the same for all locations. More specifically the threshold required to trigger a location based reminder may be based on established norms. That is the threshold may depend on the typical distance between the electronic device or user and the location. In this way when a user travels to a faraway place the threshold may be larger than when they are in their hometown.

In some embodiments a reminder condition which is used to trigger a reminder may be based on a what context item which identifies content associated with the action item. For example when an action item is associated with content such as stored content on the electronic device the manager application may monitor access to that content. When a user accesses the content associated with an action item then a reminder may be triggered. For example where the content is video or audio when a user begins to play that audio or video back then the reminder may be triggered. Similarly when the content is an email message when the user views that email message then the reminder may be triggered.

When the reminder is triggered at a visual audible or vibratory reminder may be generated on the electronic device . For example in some embodiments the electronic device may display a display screen which identifies the action item which the user is being reminded of. In at least some embodiments a user may be permitted to mark the action item as completed or may be permitted to dismiss the reminder.

Where the action item was created based on stored content i.e. content stored locally on the electronic device such as a video audio file word processor document electronic book or image then the reminder of the action item may provide access to the stored content. For example the reminder may display the content or may provide a link for accessing the content.

In some embodiments multiple reminder conditions may be associated with the same action item. That is two or more reminder conditions may exist for triggering a reminder for the same action item. These reminder conditions may operate cooperatively or independently. That is in some embodiments a reminder may be triggered when conditions corresponding to the two or more reminder conditions are determined to exist. That is conditions corresponding to all of the reminder conditions for an action item may be a pre condition for triggering the reminder. In other embodiments while an action item may be associated with multiple reminder conditions these reminder conditions may operate independently. A reminder may be triggered when a condition corresponding to any one of the reminder conditions is determined to exist.

As noted previously in some embodiments a summary of an action item may be automatically generated. In at least some embodiments a sentence may be automatically generated based on context items associated with an action item such as the who what where why and when context items . Such a sentence may summarize the action item to allow a user to easily understand the nature of the action item. That is the sentence provides an at a glance summary of the action item.

Referring now to a flowchart of an example method of generating such a sentence is illustrated. The method may in at least some embodiments be performed by the manager application . More particularly the manager application and or another application may contain computer readable instructions which when executed cause the processor of the electronic device to perform the method described below.

The method includes various operations and features which were described above with reference to the method of . To avoid repetition similar numerals have been used to indicate the same or similar features or operations of the methods and . Accordingly such operations and features may operate as described above with reference to .

First at input is received requesting creation of an action item. Such input may be received in the manner described above with reference to . At a container assignment for the action item is obtained. This container assignment may be obtained in the manner described above with reference to .

At context information associated with the action item is obtained. may be performed as described above with reference to and at an action item may be created in the manner described above with reference to . At a sentence describing the action item may be automatically generated based on the context information associated with the action item. More particularly the context information may include one or more context items. Each context item may define context information of a separate context type. For example as noted above any one or combination of the following context items may be included in the context information who . what why when where context items.

In at least some embodiments a sentence may be generated to include context information specifying the reason why the action item was created i.e. to include the context information associated with the why context item . In at least some embodiments the manager application may generate a sentence which includes a causal conjunction such as because or since before the context item specifying the reason why the action item is was created if such a causal conjunction is not already included in the reason why. For example if the why context item contains the text it is interesting then a sentence may be generated which includes the phrase because it is interesting .

In at least some embodiments the sentence may be generated to include a verb which is automatically selected based on an action item type of the action item. The action item type may be based on the content which is associated with that action item. Accordingly in at least some embodiments the manager application may identify an action item type associated with the action item based on the content which is associated with that action item. If the content associated with the action item is a document then the verb may be read or review . If the content associated with the action item is a video i.e. if the action item type is video then the verb may be watch . If the content associated with the action item is audio then the verb may be listen . If the content associated with the action item is an electronic message such as an email message then the verb may be reply read review etc. If the content associated with the action item is an image then the verb may be review look enjoy etc. Accordingly the selection of a verb for use in the sentence may depend on the type of content associated with the action item.

In at least some embodiments the sentence may be generated to include the context information in the who context item. That is the sentence may be generated to include the context item specifying one or more persons associated with the action item. The sentence may also be generated to automatically include a preposition preceding the who context item. For example a preposition which conveys involvement may be selected for inclusion in the sentence before the who context item. For example the preposition may be to e.g. to Bill or with e.g. with Bill . Such prepositions may not be included in all embodiments. For example in some embodiments a verb which conveys involvement of another party may be included before the contact is listed. For example a sentence may include contact Bill. The term contact conveys the fact that Bill s involvement may be necessary or useful for completion of the action item.

In at least some embodiments the sentence may be generated to include the context information in the when context item. That is the sentence may be generated to automatically include a context item specifying timing information associated with the action item. In at least some embodiments the automatically generated sentence may include a preposition of time before the context item specifying the timing information. For example a preposition such as before by or on may be included in the sentence before the when context item. For example if the when context item specifies a precise date such as Jul. 10 2012 then the sentence may include before Jul. 10 2012. 

In at least some embodiments the sentence may be generated to include context information specifying a location associated with the action item such as the where context item . In at least some embodiments a preposition of place may be included in the sentence before the location. For example in or at may be included in the sentence before the location e.g. at home at Toronto Ontario etc.

In at least some embodiments the action item may be associated with content such as locally stored content. For example the content may be video audio a document etc. In at least some such embodiments the sentence may be generated to include a content identifier as an object of the sentence. The object of a sentence denotes somebody or something involved in the subject s performance of the verb of the sentence. That is the object of the sentence is what the verb is acting on.

The content identifier identifies the content associated with the action item. For example if the content is video then the content identifier may be the name of the video such as a movie name TV show name and or episode name etc. . Similarly if the content is an audio file then the content identifier may be the name of the audio file such as a song name album name author name etc. . If the content is a document then the content identifier may be the title of the document. The content identifier may for example be automatically generated based on metadata associated with the content.

The sentence may be generated to include two or more context items. That is two or more of the what who where why or when context items may be used to generate the sentence.

After the sentence is generated at of the method of the sentence may be displayed as a summary on the display . An example of one such summary is illustrated in . The summary may be displayed together with an option to edit the summary. In at least some embodiments selection of the option to edit the summary may cause a display screen similar to the display screen of to be displayed which allows a user to modify context items associated with that action item. Modifying a context item may cause the sentence to be automatically updated to account for the changes to the context item.

Referring now to an example sentence is illustrated. illustrates how context items may be used to generate a sentence . More specifically illustrates how a who context item e.g. Bill a what context item e.g. Dancing baby which is a video a when context item e.g. soon a where context item e.g. home and a why context item e.g. funny may be used in a sentence . In the example illustrated the sentence is Soon watch dancing baby at home with Bill because funny . A verb is generated and used in the sentence based on the type of content associated with the action item. In the example illustrated the content is a video and so the verb is watch. The verb is automatically inserted before a content identifier dancing baby. which is included as an object of the sentence. A preposition of place e.g. at is automatically inserted before the location defined by the where context item e.g. at home . A preposition which conveys involvement e.g. with is included in the sentence before the who context item which lists a contact associated with the action item. A causal conjunction e.g. because is included in the sentence before the why context item e.g. funny .

Referring now to two alternative sentences are illustrated. These sentences are generated based on the same context items as the sentence of . The first alternative sentence is Watch Dancing baby soon when I am at home with Bill because it seems funny. The second alternative sentence is Dancing baby is a funny video that I should watch soon with Bill at home. These alternative sentences illustrate how the order of the various context items within the sentence may be altered to create a different sentence and how some of the features described above need not be included in all sentences. For example the second alternative sentence does not include a causal conjunction before the why context item .
