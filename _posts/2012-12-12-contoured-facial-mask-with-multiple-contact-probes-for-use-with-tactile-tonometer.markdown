This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 570 150 filed Dec. 13 2011.

The invention was made with Government support under contract numbers 0856761 and 115798 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for measuring the intraocular pressure i.e. the fluid pressure within an eye. More particularly the invention relates to improved systems and methods for measuring intraocular or fluid pressure within an eye.

As is well known in the art of ophthalmology measuring the intraocular pressure IOP of the eye is an important indicator of the health of the eye. Elevated IOP has been associated with progressive damage of the optic nerve known as glaucoma which if left untreated may lead to permanent loss of sight.

Various apparatus and techniques have thus been developed to measure IOP. Among the techniques are applanation tonometery dynamic contour tonometry transpalpebral diatom tonometry non contact tonometry electronic indentation tonometry rebound tonometry and digital palpation tonometry.

Applanation tonometry measures approximate intraocular pressure either by the force required to flatten a constant area of the cornea e.g. Goldmann tonometry or by the area flattened by a constant force.

In applanation tonometry a special calibrated disinfected probe attached to a slit lamp biomicroscope is used to flatten the central cornea a fixed amount. Because the probe makes contact with the cornea a topical anesthetic such as oxybuprocaine tetracaine alcaine proxymetacaine or proparacaine is introduced onto the surface of the eye in the form of one or a few eye drops. A yellow fluorescein dye is often also used in conjunction with a cobalt blue filter to aid the examiner in determining the IOP.

Goldmann tonometry is considered to be the gold standard in tonometry as it is the most widely accepted method of determining approximate intraocular pressure. However as is well known in the art Goldmann tonometry is an inherently imprecise measurement.

Dynamic contour tonometry DCT is a measuring technique that employs the 5 principle of contour matching instead of applanation to eliminate the systematic errors inherent in previous tonometers. These factors include the influence of corneal thickness rigidity curvature and elastic properties. DCT is not influenced by mechanical changes such as those seen in refractive surgery that would otherwise cause error in applanation tonometers.

An exemplar apparatus that employs DCT to measure IOP is the PASCAL Dynamic Contour Tonometer Ziemer Ophthalmics . The PASCAL uses a miniature pressure sensor embedded within a tonometer tip that is contour matched to the shape of the cornea. When the sensor is subjected to a change in pressure the electrical resistance is altered and the PASCAL s computer calculates a change in pressure in accordance with the change in resistance.

The tonometer tip rests on the cornea with a constant appositional force of one gram. This is an important difference from all forms of applanation tonometry wherein the probe force is variable.

In transpalpebral diaton tonometry a diaton tonometer is employed to measure intraocular pressure through the eyelid. It is typically regarded as a simple and safe method of ophthalmotonometry. Transpalpebral tonometry requires no contact with the cornea therefore sterilization of the device and topical anesthetic drops are not required.

Non contact tonometry or air puff tonometry uses a rapid air pulse to applanate the cornea. Corneal applanation is detected via an electro optical system. Intraocular pressure is estimated by detecting the force of the air jet at the instance of applanation.

Modern day non contact tonometers have been shown to correlate very well with Goldmann tonometry measurements and have thus generally been considered a fast and simple way to screen for high IOP. Further since non contact tonometry is accomplished without the instrument contacting the cornea the potential for disease transmission is reduced.

Electronic indentation tonometry employs a Tono Pen i.e. a portable electronic digital pen like instrument that determines IOP by making contact with the cornea. Electronic indentation tonometry is especially useful for very young children patients unable to reach a slit lamp due to disability patients who are uncooperative during applanation tonometry or patients with cornea disease in whom contact tonometry cannot be accurately performed.

In palpation tonometry also known as digital palpation tonometry measuring intraocular pressure is performed by gently pressing the fingertips of both index fingers onto the upper part of the bulbus through the eyelid. This technique requires medical experience and results in an estimation of the level of intraocular pressure based on the skills of the ophthalmologist.

A major drawback associated with each of the noted techniques is that each technique requires professional assistance to measure IOP.

A further drawback associated with each of the noted techniques is the need for topical anesthesia and complex instrumentation to measure IOP which makes multiple daily measurements impractical.

It would thus be desirable to provide improved systems and methods for measuring IOP that overcome the disadvantages and drawbacks associated with conventional systems and methods for measuring IOP.

As has been demonstrated by the inventor earlier in publications 1 2 and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 959 570 B2 3 using a multitude of force sensors it is possible to infer the intraocular pressure of the eye by measuring the forces obtained from such sensors during gradual indentation of the eye with these probes.

It has further been shown in 2 that when the force probes are applied with differ indentation rates the measured force is different whereby for the same amount of indentation higher forces are obtained under higher indentation rates.

It has further been demonstrated that when the force probes applied to the eye are tilted or displaced laterally the relative magnitude of the forces obtained from different probes changes and therefore interferes with the correct interpretation of the data and extraction of IOP 1 2 .

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for measuring IOP using an apparatus that can conforms to the anatomy of the face and therefore can be performed by the patient without professional assistance and eliminate the errors associated with variable position of the indentation.

It is another object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for applying a repeatable force under controlled rate of increase.

It is another object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for interpretation of force data obtained from multiple probes that account for sensor misalignment.

In accordance with the above objects and those that will be mentioned and will become apparent below the system for measuring IOP of an eye in accordance with one embodiment of the invention generally comprises a device for aligning a tonometry system for eye pressure measurement of a patient comprising a mask having a contour shape of the patient s face said mask comprising at least one eye ball opening said eye ball opening accommodating a plurality of contact probes moveable to contact a surface of the patient s eye ball. In one embodiment the mask has four contact probes per eye ball opening preferably comprising three outer probes and one central probe. In such embodiment the three outer probes preferably are equally radially spaced from one another. In a preferred embodiment the eye ball opening includes a plurality of separators for preventing rotational misalignment of the tonometry system. In such embodiment the separators preferably are radially equally spaced from one another.

In one embodiment of the invention IOP of the eye is determined by plotting the forces measured by two probes on a Cartesian plot and determining the location of a characteristic bend or intercept that occurs when both forces attain non zero value for the first time.

As it will be shown later the location of this characteristic bend is proportional to the IOP and the relative displacement between the two forces according to the following approximate relationship

In one embodiment of the invention the force sensing unit is detachable from the contact probes allowing identical sensing units to be used with different contact probes.

In another embodiment of the invention the force probes are permanently connected to the contact probes and integrated into a custom fitting unit.

In this embodiment the relaxation of the stress in the visco elasticity of the opposing member is responsible for the gradual advancement of the force probes.

The contoured facial mask with multiple contact probes for use with tactile tonometer will now be described in detail. As will be apparent from the following description the systems and methods of the invention substantially reduce or eliminate the disadvantages and drawbacks associated with convention systems and methods for measuring characteristics associated with an eye particularly IOP.

Referring first to there is shown one embodiment of the contoured facial mask system denoted generally 1 which in the illustrated embodiment is placed onto the face of the user .

As illustrated in the system comprises several for example four movable contact rods one end of which is shaped such as to conform to the contour of the eye and eye lid while the other end is flat allowing for intimate contact with a force measuring unit also referred to as tactile tonometer .

According to the invention to contour mask system preferably includes at least one probe that is longer than the rest labeled E in .

In a preferred embodiment the system further includes a translation stage comprised of pneumatic bladder acting against two or more springs as shown in . Alternatively spring make take the form of resiliently deformable foam as shown in .

Translating the tonometer away from the eye is performed by pressurizing the bladder while advancing it towards the eye is performed by releasing the pressure in bladder .

In one embodiment of the tactile contoured mask the tonometer contains cantilevered force sensors which are in contact with the contact rods via extension rods E.

In another embodiment of the contoured facial mask the tactile tonometer is advanced towards the eye by an operator pressing on a cap at location see which in turn compresses spring by a pre set distance H towards the mask . The compression distance sets a nearly constant spring force which is balanced by a visco elastic compression ring . Gradual collapse stress relaxation in the viscoelastic ring results in advancing the tactile tonometer towards the eye following an exponential time series.

In a preferred embodiment the length of contact probes is selected such that prior to depressing cap the contact probes are retracted a set distance into the mask . see . This distance is equal to the instantaneous displacement the visco elastic body will undergo under the action of the force of the compressed spring .

Upon depressing cap the tactile tonometer will advance instantaneously a set distance shown as yin . Subsequently the tonometer will travel according an exponential curve with diminishing velocity .

Referring now to there is shown another embodiment of a mechanical palpation system of the invention. In this embodiment the contact probes are integrated into the tactile tonometer and comprise a single unit capable of translating to and away from the eye.

As illustrated in probes are preferably attached to a flat spring plate . In one embodiment of the invention the plate contain slots that delineate flexible strips . Each of the strips contains at least one strain gauge attached to the strip and capable of measuring elastic strains.

In accordance with one embodiment of the invention during mechanical palpation with the system the contact probes will indent the flexible strips and the applied force will be measured by strain gauges .

To eliminate cross talk between neighboring strips plate is supported by several support pillars also part of the tactile tonometer . According to this embodiment of this sensor assembly the housing has a rim providing support for spring and viscoelastic member or pneumatic member .

Referring also to the underside of probes A B C D F contain an alignment stand off tabs intended to provide indentation of the central portion of each elastic strip . Flexing of the strips is detected by the strain in strain gauges .

As previously reported by us in 1 2 the eye can be modeled as a vessel with visco elastic walls filled by incompressible fluid. When the volume of the fluid is increased the vessel walls stretch and exert compressive forces onto the fluid known as intraocular pressure. Conversely the vessel walls are under tension T inducing the required stretch. When indented by the tactile probes the shape of the vessel walls change so that equilibrium is established between the tension in the deformed vessel walls and the force probes indenting it.

According to the present invention the force analysis of during tactile tonometery is approximated via an abstract one dimensional string model where the tension in the string is proportional to the IOP while its shape is modified by the action of the external force probes. While the approach is not an exact representation of the contact problem it captures essential geometric features of the tactile tonometer that provide a clear quantitative method to interpret the observed forces during palpation.

According to the present invention IOP p can be determined in proportion to the tension force T in an elastic by the following relationship mmHg Eq. 1 where p is the intraocular pressure and k is the elastic coefficient of an imaginary string representing the elasticity of the sclera. It should be noted that the Eq. 1 conforms to a thin walled vessel model where the pressure inside the vessel is proportional to the stress in the walls. If a thin section of a spherical vessel is cut along a meridian curve one will obtain a circular string stretched with tensile force T. Therefore while abstract Eq. 1 does have physical origins.

Considering a short segment of the circular string as a straight string with length L under tension T one obtains the starting configuration in .

The string from is indented by two probes and offset vertically and horizontally by distances Z and d respectively.

Advancing probes and downward leads to a non zero force registered by the extended probe while probe will measure zero until both probes reach configuration .

The model is obtained by analogy with a thin elastic string under tension T proportional to the intraocular pressure p inside the eye. Initially only the extended probe measures a force until the deformation of the string reaches an angle determined by the mutual positions of the two probes and as illustrated in configuration i.e. tan Z d. Further indentation by the two probes results in increasing forces measured by both probes as in configuration 

Further advancement of probes and leads to non zero forces measured by the probes according to cos sin cos sin for 2 tan Eq. 3 where

Substituting Eq. 5A into Eq. 2 provides the limiting force in the extended probe . A simple approximation in the case when L d 2 yields

Combining Eq. 6 with Eq. 1 shows that in the limiting configuration when F 0 the extended probe measures a force proportional to the intraocular pressure and the ratio Z d

According to this invention application of Eq. 7 allows one to determine the unknown coefficient 2k using a single measurement at a known pressure p and ratio Z d.

Furthermore Eq. 7 can be used to determine if a sensor is misaligned which would result in different Z d ratio. Since at a given pressure all force intercepts are proportional to a specific Z d ratio any change in the relative magnitude of one of the intercepts in comparison to the rest would indicate misalignment of the sensor. This information can be used to either correct for the misalignment or rejecting the measurement result and acquiring a new one.

The following examples are given to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly understand and practice the present invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention but merely as being illustrated as representative thereof.

As described in this invention a manually controlled indentation mechanism can be designed to provide the required indentation rate control for the tactile tonometer. As illustrated in when cap is compressed by a distance H the resulting spring force is F KH. This force compresses the visco elastic spacer which is can be a donut shaped open cell polyurethane foam. Open cell polyurethane foams can be described by a three parameter Maxwell viscoelastic bodies 4 . A wide variety of visco elastic foams also known as shape memory foams are available on the market including Sorbothane polynorbornene Noene Astro sorb and Neoprene.

By selecting a visco elastic member with viscoelastic material constants K units N m K units N m and C units N s m it can be shown that the mechanical model depicted in will result in exponential time response of the tonometer according to the following equation 

A sketch of the displacement y t is shown in . As can be seen the tonometer will undergo an instantaneous deflection

By choosing a foam with sufficiently large damping coefficient C the advancement velocity can be kept under 1 mm sec as which has been found to be optimal 2 .

In clinical practice it is anticipated that each human subject will have a different eye size with variable eyelid thickness and elasticity. Therefore tactile tonometers will need a calibration against an independent measurement of the IOP. Since in practice the eye pressure of a human subject cannot be adjusted at will it is advantageous to be able to calibrate the unit from a single known value of the IOP. The following example illustrates how data from several force probes can be used to determine the calibration coefficients of each from a single measurement.

As described in this invention when forces from two probes are plotted against each other the resulting curve exhibits a sharp change of slope at a point determined by Eq. 7 . shows Fverses Fand illustrates the location of this point labeled by Ffor pressure levels p 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 mmHg.

When two force probe pairs are used a total of 3 probes with known but different distance ratios Z dand Z d it is possible to obtain two calibration curves. For example instead of carrying out an experiment at pressure 2p one might use Z d 2Z d. According to Eqs. 3 and 7 the resulting force curve will be equivalent to one obtained from probe pare with ration Z dbut at pressure 2p. Therefore using multiple probe pairs one can obtain calibration curves similar as if the experiment was carried out at different pressures.

In order to obtain an absolute pressure reading at least one pressure should be known. From it the unknown subject specific coefficient 2k can be obtained according to

Based on Eq. 10 evaluated at single pressure p the subject specific calibration factor 2k can be determined for subsequent use. Therefore this method allows calibration of the tactile tonometer using a single experiment that collects data from several force pairs. The true intraocular pressure for this experiment can be obtained from Goldmann applanation tonometer.

It is apparent that this application requires at least 3 force probes. An example of such arrangement is shown in probes A B offset from E at a given distance and probes C D offset from E at another distance.

Fabricating of contoured masks conforming to the facial anatomy of a subject can be accomplished by first scanning the face using commercial laser or optical 3D scanner.

A mask with embedded probes can then be printed using stereo lithography 3D printing as illustrated in . Alternatively a mask may be custom fitted to an individual using a plurality of built in inflatable air bags shown in phantom at in .

As will readily be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art the present invention provides numerous advantages over hand held tactile tonometers and methods for measuring IOP. Among the advantages are the following 

The contoured facial mask and its components improves the repeatability of the measurements and reduces alignment errors.

The contoured facial mask and its components provides repeatable indentation and repeatable control of the rate of application of the indentation.

The contoured facial mask and its components eliminate the need for motorized more expensive indentation mechanisms.

The provision of IOP measuring systems and methods that utilize a miniaturized and integrated multi force sensor based on integrated strain gauges.

The invention also demonstrates that the calibration of the tactile tonometer can be carried out using a single know pressure followed by the application of the tactile tonometer.

Without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention one of ordinary skill can make various changes and modifications to the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. By way of example the force sensors or contact probes may be formed of ferromagnetic materials which will allow them to snap onto magnets embedded into the mask thus making a quick release version and permitting use of probes with different lengths which may be rotatable so that they interchange places. As such these changes and modifications are properly equitably and intended to be within the full range of equivalence of the following claims.
