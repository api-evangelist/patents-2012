title: Video display modification based on sensor input for a see-through near-to-eye display
abstract: This disclosure concerns a near field communication (NFC) device which includes a wrist-worn NFC-enabled electronics device, wherein the wrist-worn NFC enabled electronics device includes a first communications link for communicating with a second NFC-enabled electronics device via NFC protocols, and a second communications link for communicating with an eyepiece via a medium-range communications protocol and receiving control commands. The wrist-worn NFC-enabled electronics device facilitates the transfer of data between the eyepiece and the second NFC-enabled electronics device. The eyepiece comprises optics enabling a see-through display on which is displayed the data.
