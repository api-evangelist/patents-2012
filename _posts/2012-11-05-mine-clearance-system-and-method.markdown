title: Mine clearance system and method
abstract: A mine clearing system and method remotely deploys line charge from a remotely controlled two-wheeled vehicle. The wheels are connected together via a central hub shaft. Individual battery operated hub motors on each wheel communicate with a central controller and receiver mounted inside the hub shaft. The power source for the motors is contained within the hub shaft, with a battery recharge port located on the hub shaft. The line charge is wrapped around the central hub shaft. An operator uses a remote control console in communication with the receiver and central controller in the hub shaft to independently control each wheel of the vehicle. A camera can hang from a hub shaft bearing on the outside of one wheel so as to be gravitationally stabilized during vehicle movement. The camera can broadcast signals to a display at the remote control console.

This patent application is related to co pending patent application entitled SLURRY LINE CHARGE MINE CLEARANCE SYSTEM AND METHOD Ser. No. 13 669 725 TBD Navy Case No. 101789 filed Nov. 6 2012 TBD said co pending application being by the same inventors as this application.

The present invention relates to mine clearance. More particularly the present invention relates to systems and methods to remotely emplace explosive charges along a path suspected of being mined with explosive devices and to neutralize the suspected devices by detonating the system s explosive charges.

Currently a number of peace keeping forces are engaged in overseas contingency operations that often involve terrorist or insurgent actions that make use of mines or improvised explosive devices IEDs along roadways to hamper operations kill and maim forces and induce terror. To counter these hazards peace keeping forces need a means to quickly safely and effectively clear and neutralize mines and IEDs.

Some forces have used mine rollers and mine plows to dig up and detonate these hazards. However in heavily mined areas these forces experience a situation where they soon run out of spare parts for damaged or destroyed roller and plow hardware. In other cases forces have made use of systems using ballistic rocket deployed line charges to clear roadways. However the flight of the ballistic rocket can be erratic such that it can be difficult to deploy the line charge exactly where needed.

Further the ballistic rocket can only deploy the line charge in a straight line limiting its effectiveness on curved roadways. In addition the length of line charge that such systems can deploy is limited due to the limits on the thrust of the rocket motor. Also the use of expendable ballistic rockets make such systems relatively expensive compared to other mine clearing systems.

Thus there is a need for a mine clearance system and method that can be deployed remotely so as to provide personnel safety. The mine clearing system and method should minimize damage to mine clearing equipment while including inexpensive replaceable components. The mine clearing system and method should provide for accurate placement of long lengths of line charges including placement on curved paths and rough terrain.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a mine clearing system and method that will remotely deploy detonating cord or a line charge from a reloadable though expendable remotely controlled vehicle.

The vehicle can include two wheels connected together via a central hub shaft. Each wheel can include a hub motor. The individual hub motors can communicate to a central controller and receiver mounted inside the hollow central hub shaft. The hub motors can be battery operated and the power source for both motors can be contained within the central hub shaft. Battery recharge ports can be located on the central hub shaft. Detonating cord or other explosive line charge can be wrapped around the central hub shaft.

To deploy the system an operator uses a remote control console in communication with the receiver and central controller in the hub shaft. The operator can independently control each wheel of the vehicle with a variable forward and reverse toggle.

A night vision camera can be attached to the hub shaft to broadcast signals from the vehicle to a display at the remote control console. The camera can be connected to a hub shaft bearing on the outside of one wheel so as to hang from the bearing and be gravitationally stabilized during movement of the vehicle. A second camera can be positioned at the opposite wheel to allow three dimensional imagery to be incorporated into the remote control console display and provide the operator with depth perception.

When the vehicle is positioned at the beginning of the path to be cleared the end of the line charge is staked into place to securely hold the end of line. The operator can then remotely maneuver the vehicle down the path to be cleared while laying down a continuous length of line charge.

In this manner the full length of line charge can be remotely and precisely laid out along a roadway suspected of containing mines or IEDs. The remote operation of the vehicle allows for negotiating curves and avoiding obstacles. After paying out the full length of line charge the emptied vehicle can be remotely moved to a safe location and the line charge can then be initiated to explode any mines along the path.

In one embodiment a system for clearing land mines includes a remotely controlled vehicle a length of line charge spooled onto the vehicle and a remote controller in communication with the vehicle. The vehicle responds to signals from the remote controller so as to move in a desired direction. The movement of the vehicle pays out the line charge from the vehicle.

The vehicle can further include two wheels a tubular axle connected between the two wheels and a hub motor at each one of the two wheels. The line charge is spooled about the axle and the hub motor responds to the signals from the remote controller to rotate a respective wheel so as to produce the movement of the vehicle.

The system can further include a first camera disposed on the vehicle and in communication with the remote controller. video signals from the first camera are displayed on a video screen on the remote controller. The camera is supported from an axle bearing connected to one of the two wheels at a rotation axis of the wheel such that the axle bearing freely rotates about the rotation axis. A rod connects the camera to the axle bearing.

The system can include a second camera supported from a second axle bearing at the opposite wheel such that the video screen can display three dimensional images based on combined video signals from the first and second cameras. The cameras can be night vision cameras.

The vehicle can further include a receiver and a power source mounted within the axle. The receiver can be in communication with the remote controller and the hub motors. The power source can power the receiver the cameras and the hub motors. The vehicle can further include quick disconnect fittings between the axle and the wheels and also include a charging outlet for the power source.

In one embodiment a method of conducting a clearing operation of a mined area includes deploying a remotely controlled vehicle to a cleared area adjacent the mined area and securing a free end of a line charge that has been spooled about an axle of the vehicle. The vehicle is remotely maneuvered through the land mined area so as to pay out the line charge from the vehicle during its maneuvering and the line charge is detonated.

The method further includes paying out the full length of the line charge and remotely guiding the vehicle out of the mined area. The method can also include removing wheels from the vehicle to access the axle and connecting the wheels to a second axle having new line charge spooled thereon. Line charge can also be spooled onto the empty axle. Detonating the line charge can include attaching blasting caps to the line charge and activating the blasting caps.

As vehicle moves line charge is paid out from shaft block . Once line charge is fully paid out and off of shaft vehicle is maneuvered out of the mined area block . With vehicle away from the mined area line charge is detonated block so as to detonate any mines in the vicinity of line charge and thus clear the area of mines.

Line charge can be one of many known explosive line charges or detonation cords currently used in mine clearing operations. Alternately line charge can include an empty length of hose that can be filled with explosive slurry. Referring to there is shown a detailed block diagram of block for detonating line charge .
