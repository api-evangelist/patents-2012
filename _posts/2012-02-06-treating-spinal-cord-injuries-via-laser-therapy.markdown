The subject disclosure generally relates to a treatment for spinal cord injuries and more specifically to treating spinal cord injuries via laser therapy.

By way of background concerning spinal cord injuries it is noted that spinal cord injury patients often report an inability to feel their body as well as they had prior to their injury. Stimulating the regeneration of axons is often a goal of spinal cord repair since such regeneration increases the chances for recovering function. Namely reconnecting any axon in the injured spinal cord increases the chances for recovery of function.

Research on many fronts however reveals that regenerating axons after injury is a complicated task. For instance although neurons in the central nervous system CNS have the capacity to regenerate the environment in the adult spinal cord does not encourage such growth. Not only does the spinal cord lack growth promoting molecules present in the developing CNS it also includes substances that actively inhibit axon extension. Indeed the environment of the adult CNS is particularly hostile to axon growth because growth inhibiting proteins are embedded in myelin the insulating material around axons. It is believed that these proteins preserve neural circuits in healthy spinal cords and keep intact axons from growing inappropriately. But when the spinal cord is injured these proteins prevent regeneration.

Accordingly it would be desirable to provide a methodology for treating spinal cord injuries which overcomes these limitations. To this end it should be noted that the above described deficiencies are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.

A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary non limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended however as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.

In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure various non limiting aspects are described in connection with treating spinal cord injuries via laser therapy. In one such aspect a method that facilitates treating spinal cord injuries is provided. The method includes identifying a neurological level of a spinal cord injury and activating neurons via laser therapy. Within such embodiment a laser beam is applied to an area proximate to the neurological level.

In another aspect a computer readable storage medium that facilitates treating spinal cord injuries is provided. For this embodiment the computer readable storage medium includes computer readable instructions for causing at least one processor to perform various acts. Such acts comprise ascertaining a neurological level of a spinal cord injury and receiving data corresponding to a severity of the spinal cord injury. The acts further comprise outputting a laser calibration according to the neurological level and the severity.

In yet another aspect a medical device apparatus that facilitates treating spinal cord injuries is provided. Within such embodiment the apparatus includes a processor configured to execute computer executable components stored in memory. The computer executable components include an assessment component and a calibration component. The assessment component is configured to receive at least one parameter corresponding to a spinal cord injury whereas the calibration component is configured to ascertain a laser calibration according to the at least one parameter.

Other embodiments and various non limiting examples scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.

As discussed in the background it is desirable to effectively treat patients who have sustained spinal cord injuries. The various embodiments disclosed herein are directed towards treating spinal cord injuries with a laser therapy. For instance a laser therapy is disclosed which enables a body to discover previously under utilized nervous system pathways and accentuate their procedural participation. In another aspect a laser therapy is disclosed which facilitates a development of new neuronal connections.

In a particular embodiment spinal cord injury patients are provided with a custom laser therapy that varies according to the severity and or location of the injury. To this end it should be noted that customizing various parameters of the laser therapy disclosed herein have been discovered to be particularly effective. For instance rather than generically applying a laser to the entire spinal cord it has been discovered that healing is substantially expedited when a laser is applied onto the specific neurological level of the injury wherein the calibration and application angle of the laser varies according to the severity of the injury. In a further aspect it has been discovered that particularly desirable results are attained when the aforementioned laser therapy is coupled with simultaneous tactile stimulation of a dermatome corresponding to the neurological level of the injury.

Turning now to an exemplary neurological level and corresponding dermatome is provided according to an embodiment. As illustrated it is contemplated that a laser can be applied to the neurological level of an injury via any of a plurality of angles. For this particular example neurological level is a T neurological level wherein it is contemplated that a laser be applied to neurological level via any combination of posterior angle posterior angle posterior angle anterior angle anterior angle and or anterior angle . To this end it should be appreciated that the application angle of the laser may depend on any of various factors including but not limited to the desired neuron type to be activated. For instance it has been discovered that motor related neurons are particularly responsive when a laser is applied via an anterior angle whereas sensory nerves are generally more responsive when applying a laser via a posterior angle. Furthermore as illustrated it is contemplated that it may sometimes be desirable to apply a laser via non perpendicular angles such as posterior angle posterior angle anterior angle and or anterior angle . Indeed it is contemplated that varying between perpendicular and non perpendicular angles can expose a wider range of neurons to the laser therapy and thus increase total neuron activation.

In a further aspect it has been discovered that other laser characteristics can be customized to yield optimal results as well. For instance a laser can be calibrated according to a particular injury s severity to provide a customized laser treatment. Exemplary calibrations may include but are not limited to a pulsed frequency calibration a power calibration and or a wavelength calibration. The width of the laser can also be varied although a width between 800 970 nanometers has been discovered to be particularly effective.
