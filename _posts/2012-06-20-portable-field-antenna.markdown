The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to the field of radio antennas and more specifically to portable radio antennas used by military personnel for radio communications in the field

Prevailing in a battlefield environment requires maintaining command and control over troops deployed in the field and this entails ability for those troops to communicate their status and situation back to their commanders. Advances in communication gear currently enable deployed troops to employ a variety of radios with different capabilities but those radios must be able to send signals that can be received by other communication gear available to commanders. For example many units of the United States Army and Marine Corps deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan carry radios that are part of the Distributed Tactical Communications System DTCS . The DTCS radios transmit their communication signals to low earth orbit Iridium satellites that retransmit those radio communications back to command positions. The DTCS system uses line of sight radios that must be positioned where their signals can reach the satellite to complete a successful communication.

Frequently the antenna that affixed to the DTCS radio is not in position to successfully send the signal to the satellite. That means the radio operator must reposition himself to a location where the radio and its antenna can communicate with the satellite system which can potentially expose the operator to dangerous conditions. Alternatively due to terrain or man made obstructions sometimes the field unit must connect their radios to a deployed field antenna or field antenna array that can transmit their radio communications to the satellite system.

The current field antenna used by the Army Marines and other components of the American military is designated as the OE 254. This consists of several metal tubes that must be connected together and then raised to an upright position. When erected to its 42 foot full height the OE 254 requires eight guy lines to securely tie it down so that it does not fall over. Proper deployment of the eight guy lines requires an open area with a 50 foot diameter which complicates deployment in restricted areas such as heavy vegetation or crowded urban neighborhoods. Upon deployment the OE 254 constitutes a static antenna that cannot be relocated without significant disassembly.

The OE 254 has other disadvantages such as requiring at least two people to set up and indeed typically needing four to five people. Full assembly takes up to 15 minutes. The OE 254 weighs approximately 50 pounds and stowed in a bag measuring approximately 36 18 6 denoting inches which is too heavy for personnel on foot to carry for any significant distance particularly in rugged terrain. In addition the OE 254 is quite visible once deployed and so provides hostile forces with an indicator of the presence of the unit using it. The OE 254 is also not designed to attach to a building or other objects which hampers deployment in urban areas.

There remains an unmet need for a light weight easily assembled field antenna system that can be used in a variety of locations and situations to enhance the communication abilities of military personnel deployed in the field. Conventional portable antennas yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide portable field antenna PFA platform to support an L band antenna and facilitate communication via a cable. The PFA platform includes a plurality of tubes a shock cord and an antenna mount. Each tube of the plurality has a sleeve and a ferrule inserted therein at a first end of that sleeve. The ferrule of a first tube detachably inserts into a second end of the sleeve of a second adjacent tube. The one piece shock cord extends the full length of the mast assembly passing through each tube to connect the plurality of tubes together by elastic tension starting from a first concatenating terminal to ending at a second concatenating terminal. The antenna mount attaches to the antenna and connects to the first concatenating terminal. The mount includes an antenna connector for connecting the cable to the antenna.

The tubes form one of a zig zag bundle in a stow configuration and a mast in a deploy configuration. The bundle has the ferrule and sleeve on said adjacent tubes being foldably separate from each other. The mast has the ferrule on the first tube inserted into the sleeve on the adjacent second tube for the plurality of tubes. Other various embodiments alternatively or additionally provide for a hook on the mount for hanging onto an environmental support and a tip for inserting the end of the mast opposite the antenna into the ground.

For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the present invention references are made in the text to exemplary embodiments of a portable field antenna PFA platform only some of which are described herein. It should be understood that no limitations on the scope of the invention are intended by describing these exemplary embodiments. An artisan of ordinary skill will readily appreciate that alternate but functionally equivalent materials components and configurations may be used together with the inclusion of additional elements that may be deemed readily apparent. Specific elements disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching the artisan to employ the present invention. It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale instead emphasis has been placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention. Moreover the terms substantially or approximately as used herein may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related.

The tubes can be composed of any light weight rigid material that supports the antenna and components on top of the mast with minimal electrical interference. The tubes are preferably made from carbon fiber with annular cross sections although alternate geometries can be contemplated without departing from the scope of the invention. In the configuration depicted each tube has dimensions of 0.625 outside diameter by 0.50 inside diameter and with a length of 12 . The PFA employs carbon fiber tubing for its mast to be very lightweight extremely strong and easy to set up. Being shock corded together the tubes slip inside each other and so the mast reaches full length in a few seconds. By using carbon fiber the tube diameters remain consistent regardless of the temperature that an operator may encounter in the field as well as being light weight for improved portability.

In the exemplary embodiment shown the PFA supports an antenna assembly with an L band antenna for communicating with the Iridium communication satellite system and the Global Positioning System GPS . The antenna assembly may alternatively or additionally include auxiliary or multiple antennas to enhance communications of very high frequency ultra high frequency VHF UHF radios or to provide redundancy in even of failure of a single antenna or signal receiving device. In alternative embodiments the antenna assembly may include sensing or recording equipment.

In the embodiment shown the antenna assembly with the antenna assembly is affixed to the mast and a radio frequency RF cable attaches via an RF cable connector plug on the underside of antenna assembly at the antenna assembly . The distal end of the cable connects to a radio of the unit deploying the PFA . In the exemplary embodiment shown the cable is a twenty foot 20 long armored RF cable suitable for use by the military operating in the field. In other exemplary embodiments cable may be longer or shorter than 20 . Depending on the number of tubes the mast can be raised to a variety of discrete vertical heights with the example shown representing from ground level .

Each hollow carbon fiber tube includes the sleeve having an annular cross section with a 0.625 inch outside diameter by 00.5 inside diameter and a length of 12 or 1 foot . The ferrule with an outside diameter of 0.495 and 5 length is bonded to the inside of the 12 sleeve with half of the ferrule protruding out the top of the sleeve thereby forming the tube . The exposed portion of the ferrule at the top of one sleeve slides into the bottom of the next 12 sleeve . The 0.005 difference in outer diameter of the ferrule and inner diameter of the 12 sleeve combined with the elasticity of the shock cord creates a connection that quickly slips together into the mast .

In the embodiment shown the elastic tension cord secures one end of each hollow tube to its adjacent counterpart. In the embodiment shown the elastic tension cord represents flexible connector shock line known in the art which secures the axially aligned tubes . The exemplary shock cord has diameter 0.1875 with length of 10 to connect together all of the tubes that form the mast . The shock cord has flexibility to bend when collapsing the tubes in zig zag fashion as a bundle for stowage or transport. The shock cord imposes sufficient tensile force to align and force the ferrule to insert into the adjacent sleeve for rapid assembly into the mast . Various quantities of hollow tubes may be assembled with ten being shown in the elevation view although the height of the mast can be varied by the number of concatenated tubes . The PFA is designed for rapid assembly and disassembly. Moreover the PFA can be carried to another location even with the mast assembled while still connected to radio communication devices and therefore remain fully operational during transit.

A vertical plate supports a lateral plate onto which the bracket mounts. The horizontal plate pivots relative to the vertical plate by a hinge for roll angle adjustment. The plate connects to a mount bracket and includes a nut to serve as a lanyard tie nib. The cable terminates in an RF plug . The bracket includes an RF connector into which the plug can be inserted. Quick release push pins and insert into aligned holes in the vertical plate and the mount bracket to enable the vertical plate and thereby the antenna to adjust in pitch angle. The mount bracket further includes a rod that connects to the mast and a hook for hanging from an environmental support such as a roof structure or tree branch. The hook enables suspending the mast to achieve varied heights and facilitate antenna operation in a variety of conditions and terrains.

The dome bracket and the vertical plate contain apertures or slots into which the quick release pin or any other securing member known in the art may be inserted to join them together. The hinge enables adjustment of the angle of antenna assembly for optimum orientation for radio performance. Upon determining the best position the position of antenna assembly can be locked in place with the quick release push pin or similar component . The RF cable connects to the antenna assembly by inserting the RF cable connector plug into the antenna connector . In the exemplary embodiment shown RF cable connector plug is a TNC connector plug and RF cable connector is a TNC jack. The underside of the dome bracket also includes the RF cable connector which enables connection of a second RF cable to antenna assembly for wireless communication.

The tubes that comprise the mast need not be uniform as long as the top of the ferrule can slide into the bottom of the sleeve directly adjacent. Alternatively the PFA could be assembled from telescoping tubes at a cost of likely increase the size and weight of the system. The exemplary tubes could optionally be secured with pins but these are not necessary and add weight to the system with increase in assembly time. Opposite the antenna assembly the PFA optionally includes the tapered bullet shaped end piece made of 6061 aluminum in order to prevent damage to the end carbon fiber tube when driving the mast into the ground . The bullet shaped tip can be secured to the mast with a 6 32 set screw. Detachable fold out legs for a tripod system can be used to augment stability in the installed upright position.

In the embodiment of the PFA shown in assembly view the shaft collar slides onto to antenna mast for positioning about three quarters of the distance from the ground up to the antenna assembly and secured by a locking lever . Once in place the shaft collar provides attachment through holes for guy lines to hold the mast erect. For installation the tent stakes are pounded into the ground and attached to the guy lines with the carabiners . For installation the antenna mast is erected to vertically upright and the guy lines are tightened sufficiently to secure the PFA to the upright position.

The PFA can be disassembled by releasing the guy lines lower the mast and then removing the antenna assembly from the antenna assembly . The hollow tubes that form the antenna mast are then secured in a compact bundle by a restraining band and all of the disassembled pieces including the shaft collar guy lines and tent stakes can be placed in the backpack for transport by a single person on foot.

The PFA was developed to meet several capability gaps first to augment the Distributed tactical Communications System DTCS radios helping tactical or forward deployed units by its compact size portability and ease of use. The PFA enables war fighters snipers being a prime example to maintain cover and concealment while still fulfilling their mission. For instance in an urban environment buildings can be used to provide cover and concealment from the enemy but this compromises RF communications due to signal blockage and frequently renders satellite communications impossible. Exemplary embodiments enable the antenna assembly to be attached directly to the top of the mast and with the operator tethered to the radio and thus the antenna through an audio handset or headset. The PFA enables the antenna to be mounted in a location where the war fighter can maximize the communication performance while remaining concealed maintaining their radio at their side while running the cable to the mast and antenna assembly just above the roofline. This enables SATCOM line of sight radios such as DTCS to maintain a link with a communication satellite. Or if the war fighter is using a VHF UHF radio such as a PRC 148 MBITR or PRC 152 Falcon III an omni directional antenna out of the building and into open air facilitates better communication to avoid obstruction of the radiation pattern as would occur if the antenna was still in the building. In addition the hook at the end of the mast enables the war fighter to hang the PFA to a height of 10 in the air from wherever their hands reach approximately 17 high for the average man. This can be accomplished in a minute or two being desirable for a military unit on the move in an urban canyon that is trying to communicate with others but may not be able to due to the height of surrounding buildings.

On the opposite end of the environmental spectrum the PFA also benefits a war fighter operating in dense foliage or in mountainous terrain. Frequently operations in those terrains hamper RF communication. For example in Afghanistan for a patrol using existing VHF UHF radios may only be able to talk several miles back to their base camp due to hills or mountains. While the PFA system cannot overcome all issues stemming from terrain obstruction its benefit can be valuable. For example DTCS radios of which thousands have been or remain in use in Operation Enduring Freedom OEF and Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF use the Iridium constellation of low earth orbit satellites. Iridium satellites spend approximately 80 of their time on the lowest 20 of the horizon. Because the PFA enables a war fighter to elevate the antenna 10 or 17 or more if hooked to a tree branch or building the design greatly increases the time that the war fighter can maintain the link to the satellite. Although existing VHF UHF radios like the PRC 148 don t communicate with satellites a war fighter can also increase the communications reliability of those radios by using the PFA .

Capt. Matkins USMC was embedded with 2Battalion 3Marines Golf Company during a four day exercise in July 2010. He reports from a field exercise for the PFA denoted as man portable field antenna or MPFA Setting up the MPFA is very easy. It can be done with one person in a minute or two. Remove the necessary components from the carry pack example if you re not tying it down with the guy lines you won t need them or the quick release shaft collar. Undo the band that bundles the mast together. Deploy the mast and let the shock cord do its work just like a set of tent poles. Take the antenna bracket and secure it to the top of the mast hook with the quick release push pin. Undo the band that holds the RF cable in a loop. Connect it to the DTCS antenna or the TNC TNC adapter if you wish to utilize another antenna that has a TNC plug . Now connect the cable to your radio. If you wish to utilize it as a stand alone mast these are the additional steps. Remove the tent stakes guy lines and quick release shaft collar from the bag. While holding the mast align the notch in the shaft collar with the screw at the bottom of the mast. Slide the collar up about three quarters the length of the mast turn the lever to tighten and secure it. Place tent stakes into desired location and drive them into the ground. Take guy lines and using the carabiners at the end of the line clip them to the shaft collar. Take the other end of the guy lines and wrap them around the special quick tie FIG. carabiners. 

The PFA can be used in any length in 1 increments up to 10 in the embodiments shown by linking selected numbers of tubes . The PFA also has the ability to articulate i.e. pivot its antenna assembly in pitch and roll. One quick release push pin positions the antenna bracket on the mast assembly while the second pin enables the angle of the dome bracket to be adjusted such as for example if the hook is used to hang the mast from a tree branch or building the dome bracket may be canted at an angle if the antenna assembly loses its optimum orientation with the sky. The pin can be pulled out to adjust the antenna equipment to another position to improve radio performance.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
