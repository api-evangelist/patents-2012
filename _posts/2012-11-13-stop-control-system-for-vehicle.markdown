The present invention relates to a stop control system for a vehicle which automatically stops and restarts an internal combustion engine during a stop of the vehicle and controls the braking force of the vehicle such that it is increased.

Conventionally as a stop control system for a vehicle of this type there has been known one disclosed in PTL 1. An internal combustion engine installed on this vehicle is of a so called idle stop type which is stopped when predetermined stop conditions are satisfied and thereafter is restarted when predetermined restart conditions are satisfied. The vehicle includes a brake system for braking the vehicle during normal operation and further includes a hydraulic pump for increasing the braking force during a stop of the vehicle.

This brake system has a master cylinder that generates a brake fluid pressure according to a stepping on operation of a brake pedal using negative pressure in an intake pipe and brake units each provided for each wheel and having a wheel cylinder. The brake system brakes the vehicle by supplying the brake fluid pressure generated in the master cylinder to the wheel cylinder via a hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic pump is provided in the middle of the hydraulic circuit and is driven by a motor.

In this stop control system when restart conditions including e.g. release of the stepping on of a foot brake are satisfied during an automatic stop of the engine the engine is cranked by supplying power from a battery to a starter motor. During the cranking power required for cranking is secured by inhibiting the operation of the hydraulic pump performed by the motor. Further when a failure of cranking for the restart is detected and also the foot brake is stepped on the hydraulic pump is driven by supplying power from the battery to the motor to thereby increase the brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder and the braking force of the vehicle whereby the movement of the vehicle during the stop is prevented.

As described above in the conventional stop control system when restart conditions are satisfied during an idle stop cranking is preferentially performed and the operation of the hydraulic pump for increasing the braking force of the vehicle is inhibited during this cranking. Therefore during cranking the braking force of the vehicle is lowered and becomes insufficient which may cause the vehicle during the stop to be moved so that it is impossible to sufficiently achieve the safety of the vehicle.

The present invention has been made to provide a solution to the above described problems and an object thereof is to provide a stop control system for a vehicle which is capable of positively increasing during an idle stop the braking force of the vehicle and thereby positively preventing the movement of the vehicle during the stop.

To attain the above object the invention according to claim is a stop control system for a vehicle V for stopping an internal combustion engine installed on the vehicle having a brake system when predetermined stop conditions are satisfied restarting the engine when predetermined restart conditions are satisfied and controlling a braking force of the vehicle V such that the braking force is increased in order to supplement the braking force of the brake system during a stop of the vehicle V comprising cranking means starter motor for cranking the engine using power supplied from a predetermined power source battery in an embodiment the same applies hereinafter in this section when the restart conditions are satisfied a braking force increasing device hydraulic pump electric brake that is driven by power supplied from the power source for increasing the braking force of the vehicle V braking force increasing necessity determining means ECU for determining whether or not the braking force of the vehicle V needs to be increased by the braking force increasing device during a stop of the vehicle and control means ECU steps in for causing the braking force increasing device to operate when it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V needs to be increased wherein the control means inhibits the cranking when the restart conditions are satisfied during operation of the braking force increasing device steps to in .

The engine is installed on the vehicle and is of a so called idle stop type that is automatically stopped when predetermined stop conditions are satisfied and is thereafter automatically restarted when predetermined restart conditions are satisfied. When the above mentioned restart conditions are satisfied the engine is cranked by the cranking means using power supplied from the predetermined power source so as to restart the engine.

Further the stop control system according to the present invention includes a braking force increasing device that is driven by power supplied from the power source which is common to the cranking means and if it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle needs to be increased by the braking force increasing device during a stop of the vehicle the braking force increasing device is activated. Further in a case where the restart conditions are satisfied during operation of the braking force increasing device the cranking is inhibited.

Thus when restart conditions from the idle stop state are satisfied during operation of the braking force increasing device cranking is inhibited to continue the operation of the braking force increasing device. This makes it possible to prevent the voltage from being lowered due to the cranking to thereby ensure a stable operation of the braking force increasing device whereby it is possible to positively increase the braking force of the vehicle and hence positively prevent the vehicle during a stop from moving. Further the braking force increasing device is activated only when it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle needs to be increased which makes it possible to efficiently perform the operation of the braking force increasing device without wasting the power.

The invention according to claim is the stop control system according to claim wherein the control means inhibits the cranking until the operation of the braking force increasing device is terminated and causes the cranking to be started when the operation of the braking force increasing device is terminated steps to in .

With this configuration it is possible to ensure a more stable operation of the braking force increasing device by inhibiting the cranking until the operation of the braking force increasing device is terminated. Further it is possible to start the cranking as quickly as possible by starting the cranking when the operation of the braking force increasing device is terminated and thereby restart the engine without any difficulty.

The invention according to claim is the stop control system according to claim or wherein the control means stops the braking force increasing device when a predetermined time period elapses after starting the operation of the braking force increasing device steps in .

With this configuration the braking force increasing device is operated for the predetermined time period whereby the operation time thereof is sufficiently secured. Therefore it is possible to positively increase the braking force of the vehicle.

The invention according to claim is the stop control system according to claim further comprising road surface slope detecting means acceleration sensor for detecting a slope ASLP of a road surface on which the vehicle V is stopped and predetermined time period setting means ECU for setting the predetermined time period TBRREF according to the detected slope ASLP of the road surface.

The mobility of the vehicle during an idle stop is different depending on the slope of a road surface on which the vehicle is stopped. As the slope of the road surface is larger the mobility of the vehicle becomes higher. With the above configuration a predetermined time period that determines an actual operation time period of the braking force increasing device is set according to the detected slope of the road surface. Therefore it is possible to operate the braking force increasing device for an appropriate time period according to the mobility of the vehicle dependent on the slope of the road surface.

The invention according to claim is the stop control system according to any one of claims to wherein the brake system is configured to brake the vehicle V by a brake fluid pressure that is supplied to a wheel cylinder the stop control system further comprising wheel cylinder pressure detecting means wheel cylinder pressure sensor for detecting the brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder wheel cylinder pressure PWC and wherein the braking force increasing necessity determining means determines that the braking force needs to be increased by the braking force increasing device when the detected brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder has lowered to not higher than a predetermined pressure PREF steps in .

With this configuration the brake system is configured to brake the vehicle by the brake fluid pressure that is supplied to the wheel cylinder and it is determined that the braking force needs to be increased by the braking force increasing device when the detected brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder has lowered to not higher than a predetermined pressure. This makes it possible to properly operate the braking force increasing device according to the actual lowered state of the brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder that drives the brake system and efficiently obtain a required braking force.

The invention according to claim is the stop control system according to claim wherein the control means stops the braking force increasing device when the brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder exceeds the predetermined pressure PREF after activating the braking force increasing device steps A in .

With this configuration after activating the braking force increasing device it is possible to stop the braking force increasing device in a state where the brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder has actually and sufficiently recovered and therefore it is possible to positively increase the braking force of the vehicle and efficiently operate the braking force increasing device

The invention according to claim is the stop control system according to claim or further comprising road surface slope detecting means acceleration sensor for detecting a slope ASLP of a road surface on which the vehicle V is stopped and predetermined pressure setting means ECU step in for setting a predetermined pressure PREF according to the detected slope ASLP of the road surface.

The mobility of the vehicle during an idle stop is different depending on the slope of a road surface on which the vehicle is stopped. As the slope of the road surface is larger the mobility of the vehicle becomes higher. With the above configuration the predetermined pressure for determining whether or not the braking force increasing device can be activated or stopped is set according to the detected slope of the road surface. Therefore it is possible to properly control the activation or stop of the braking force increasing device according to the mobility of the vehicle based on a result of comparison between the brake fluid pressure in the wheel cylinder and the set predetermined pressure.

The invention according to claim is the stop control system according to any one of claims to further comprising vehicle speed detecting means wheel speed sensor for detecting a speed of the vehicle V vehicle speed VP and the braking force increasing necessity determining means determines that the braking force needs to be increased by the braking force increasing device when the detected speed of the vehicle is not equal to 0 steps in .

With this configuration it is determined that the braking force needs to be increased by the braking force increasing device when the detected speed of the vehicle is not equal to 0 and hence it is possible to operate the braking force increasing device according to even slight movement of the vehicle and more positively prevent the vehicle from further moving. Further since the vehicle speed detecting means is normally provided for controlling the vehicle or the engine it is possible to obtain the above described advantageous effects using such an existing device without causing an increase in the manufacturing costs.

The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings showing a preferred embodiment thereof. schematically shows a vehicle V to which the present invention is applied. As shown in the the vehicle V is a four wheel vehicle of front wheel drive type which has left and right front wheels WFL and WFR and left and right rear wheels WRL and WRR hereinafter referred to as the wheels W when generically referred to and includes an internal combustion engine hereinafter referred to as the engine installed on the front part of the vehicle V an automatic transmission for changing speed of power from the engine and a brake system see for braking the vehicle V.

The engine is a gasoline engine that performs as described hereinafter a so called idle stop for automatically stopping the engine when predetermined stop conditions are satisfied and automatically restarting the same when predetermined restart conditions are satisfied. Further the restart of the engine is performed by driving a starter motor using power supplied from a battery see to thereby rotate crank the crankshaft not shown and injecting fuel from fuel injection valves .

The automatic transmission is comprised of a torque converter that is connected to the crankshaft of the engine a shift lever with which one of eight shift positions of 1 2 3 D4 D5 N R and P can be selected and a gear mechanism with which it is possible to switch between one of the six speed positions of first to fifth speeds and reverse can be switched none of which are shown . An output shaft not shown of the torque converter of the automatic transmission is connected to the left and right front wheels WFL and WFR via a final reduction gear unit and drive shafts and whereby the power of the engine is transmitted to the front wheels WFL and WFR.

As shown in the brake system is of a hydraulic type using brake fluid such as hydraulic oil and is comprised of a brake pedal a master cylinder a hydraulic circuit and a disc brake provided for each wheel W. The disc brake includes a disc see FIG. integrally formed with the wheel W a pair of movable brake pads not shown disposed on both sides of the disc a piston not shown for driving the brake pads and a wheel cylinder . When the brake pedal is stepped on by a driver of the vehicle V by supplying the brake fluid pressure generated in the master cylinder to the wheel cylinder via the brake circuit the brake pads are driven to hold the disc therebetween whereby the vehicle V is braked. A detailed description of the configuration and operation of the brake system will be given hereinafter.

Further the left and right rear wheels WRL and WRR are provided with respective electric brakes separately from the above described brake system . As shown in the electric brake includes a caliper body integrally formed with a body not shown of the vehicle V a nut fixed in the caliper body a screw screwed in the nut and movable in the axial direction a pair of brake pads and housed in a recess of the caliper body and a brake motor having a rotating shaft being connected to one end of the screw . One brake pad is secured to the wall surface of the recess the other brake pad is attached to the other end of the screw and the disc of the disc brake is disposed between the brake pads and

With the above described configuration when the brake motor performs normal rotation the screw is moved toward the disc while rotating whereby the brake pad is moved together therewith to hold the disc with the brake pad whereby the rear wheels WRL and WRR are braked. When the brake motor performs reverse rotation from this state by action reverse to the above the brake pad is moved toward the brake motor to leave the disc whereby the braking of the rear wheels WRL and WRR is released. Such operations of the electric brake are performed according to the operating state of an electric brake switch not shown provided in the driver s seat of the vehicle V and are controlled by a control signal from an ECU described hereinafter.

Next referring to the configuration of the above described brake system will be described in detail. The master cylinders of the brake system are of a tandem type each having two hydraulic chambers and pistons none of which are shown . The brake fluid is supplied from a reservoir to each hydraulic chamber and one piston is connected to the brake pedal . Further a brake booster is provided between the brake pedal and the master cylinder . The brake booster generates an assist force that acts on the piston using negative pressure generated in the intake pipe during operation of the engine to thereby assist the operating force of the brake pedal .

When the brake pedal is operated two pistons are moved to pressurize the brake fluid in each hydraulic chamber whereby the brake fluid pressure is generated according to the operating force of the brake pedal assisted by the brake booster and is output from a first output port and a second output port that are communicated with respective hydraulic chambers.

The hydraulic circuit of the brake system is comprised of a first hydraulic circuit A that is linked between the first output port and the wheel cylinders and of the left front wheel WFL and the right rear wheel WRR and a second hydraulic circuit B that is linked between the second output port and the wheel cylinders and of the right front wheel WFR and the left rear wheel WRL.

These two system hydraulic circuits A and B have the same configuration with each other and hence the following description is given of the first hydraulic circuit A by way of example. Further in the following description when upstream is mentioned concerning various fluid lines described hereinafter it means a side toward the master cylinder and when downstream is mentioned concerning the same it means a side toward the wheel cylinder .

A first fluid line is connected to the first output port of the master cylinder . A first control valve and a second control valve for VSA Vehicle Stability Assist are disposed in parallel with each other at respective locations downstream of the first fluid line and further the first control valve is provided with a check valve disposed in parallel therewith.

The first control valve is formed by a normally open solenoid valve that allows bidirectional flow of the brake fluid and is connected to the reservoir downstream thereof via a second fluid line . The check valve is so disposed as to allow flow of the brake fluid from upstream to downstream of the first control valve .

The second control valve is formed by a normally closed solenoid valve that allows flow of the brake fluid only from upstream thereof and is connected downstream to the second fluid line via a third fluid line . Further the second fluid line is provided with a check valve at a location closer to a reservoir than to a portion thereof connected to the third fluid line which allows flow of the brake fluid from the reservoir .

Two fourth fluid lines and are connected to the above described second fluid line in parallel with each other and these fourth fluid lines and are connected to the wheel cylinders and of the left front wheel WFL and the right rear wheel WRR respectively. Each fourth fluid line is provided with an inflow valve and a check valve that are disposed in parallel with each other. The inflow valve is formed by a normally open solenoid valve that allows bidirectional flow of the brake fluid. Further the check valve is so disposed as to allow flow of the brake fluid from downstream to upstream of the inflow valve .

Further a fifth fluid line branches from a portion of each fourth fluid line which is downstream of the inflow valve and each fifth fluid line is provided with an outflow valve . The outflow valve is formed by a normally closed solenoid valve that allows flow of the brake fluid only from the inflow valve . The fifth fluid lines and join a sixth fluid line and the sixth fluid line is connected to a portion of the second fluid line which is closer to the reservoir than to the check valve .

The second fluid line is provided with a hydraulic pump at a location remoter from the reservoir than the portion thereof connected to the third fluid line is and the hydraulic pump is connected to a hydraulic motor . The hydraulic motor is driven by power supplied from the battery based on a drive signal from the ECU whereby the hydraulic pump is driven.

Next a basic operation of the brake system configured as above will be described. In a state in which the vehicle V and the engine are normally operate the brake system is controlled to a normal operation mode shown in . That is all the first control valves second control valves inflow valves and outflow valves of the brake system are controlled to a non excited state and the hydraulic motor and the hydraulic pump are at rest.

In this normal operation mode when the brake pedal is stepped on a brake fluid pressure master cylinder pressure PMC that is pressurized according to the sum of the operating force of the brake pedal and the assist force of the brake booster is generated in the master cylinder . This brake fluid pressure is output from the first and second output ports and to each first fluid line of the first and second hydraulic circuits A and B and is supplied to the wheel cylinder of each wheel W further via the first control valve the inflow valve and the fourth fluid line . Thus the disc brake of each wheel W is operated to brake the vehicle V with the braking force commensurate with a wheel cylinder pressure PWC.

Further to increase the braking force of the vehicle V from the controlled state in the normal mode the first control valve is excited to be closed the second control valve is excited to be opened and the hydraulic motor is driven to operate the hydraulic pump pressurization mode . In this pressurization mode the brake fluid is pumped by the hydraulic pump from the reservoir and is pressurized and the pressurized brake fluid is supplied to the wheel cylinder via the second fluid line the inflow valve and the fourth fluid line . This increases the wheel cylinder pressure PWC whereby the braking force of the vehicle V is increased.

Further after the above described pressurization mode and the like to retain the braking force of the vehicle V from the controlled state in the pressurization mode the second control valve is changed into a non excited state to cause the same to be closed retention mode . In this retention mode the first fluid line communicating with the master cylinder is closed by the first control valve and the brake fluid returning from the second fluid line to the reservoir is blocked by the check valve so that outflow of the brake fluid from the wheel cylinder is prevented. This retains the wheel cylinder pressure PWC and the braking force of the vehicle V. Note that the retention mode is released at the standing start of the vehicle V and the brake system returns to the above described normal operation mode.

Further to perform various controls including control of the above described brake system sensors for detecting operating conditions of the vehicle V and the engine are provided as follows First the first fluid line is provided with a master cylinder pressure sensor for detecting the master cylinder pressure PMC and the second fluid line is provided with a wheel cylinder pressure sensor for detecting the wheel cylinder pressure PWC to deliver signals indicative of respective detections to the ECU see .

Further as shown in a CRK signal indicative of the rotational speed of the crankshaft of the engine from a crank angle sensor and a VW signal indicative of the rotational speed of each wheel W from a wheel speed sensor are input to the ECU . The ECU calculates a rotational speed of the engine hereinafter referred to as the engine speed NE based on the CRK signal and a vehicle speed VP that is the speed of the vehicle V based on the VW signal.

Further input to the ECU are a detection signal indicative of an accelerator pedal opening degree AP of the accelerator pedal not shown hereinafter referred to as the accelerator pedal opening AP from an accelerator pedal opening sensor a detection signal indicative of a shift position SP of the shift lever from a shift position sensor and a detection signal indicative of a forward rearward acceleration GFR of the vehicle V from an acceleration sensor .

Further a detection signal indicative of a voltage VB of the battery hereinafter referred to as the battery voltage VB is input from a voltage sensor to the ECU . The ECU calculates a remaining charge amount SOC of the battery hereinafter referred to as the battery remaining charge SOC based on this detection signal and so forth.

Further from an ignition switch a detection signal indicative of an on off state of the same and from a brake switch a detection signal indicative of an on off state of the same are input to the ECU .

The ECU is implemented by a microcomputer comprised of a CPU a RAM a ROM and an input interface none of which are shown . The ECU determines the operating conditions of the engine and the vehicle V based on a control program stored in the ROM or the like according to the detection signals from the above mentioned various sensors to and switches and and performs various control processes including control of the braking force of the engine and the vehicle V based on results of the determination.

More specifically the ECU controls the starter motor and the fuel injection valve to thereby perform idle stop control of the engine . Further the ECU controls excitation non excitation of the first control valve the second control valve the inflow valve and the outflow valve each formed by an electromagnetic valve of the brake system separately and performs control of the braking force of the vehicle V by controlling the hydraulic pump and the electric brake via the hydraulic motor and the brake motor respectively.

In the present embodiment the ECU corresponds to braking force increasing necessity determining means control means predetermined time period setting means and predetermined pressure setting means.

Next control processes performed by the ECU will be described with reference to . The idle stop control process shown in is for controlling the idle stop and subsequent restart of the engine and is performed at predetermined time intervals.

In the present process first in a step shown as S the following steps are also similarly shown it is determined whether or not the predetermined stop conditions of the engine are satisfied. The stop conditions are a plurality of conditions a to g described below 

If all these conditions a to g are satisfied it is determined that the stop conditions are satisfied and an idle stop flag F IDLSTP is set to 1. On the other hand if any one of these conditions a to g is not satisfied it is determined that the stop conditions are not satisfied and the idle stop flag F IDLSTP is set to 0.

Next in a step it is determined whether or not the above idle stop flag F IDLSTP is equal to 1. If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES it is determined whether or not the accelerator pedal opening AP is not smaller than a predetermined restart determining opening degree APST step . If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO injection of fuel from the fuel injection valves is stopped to control the engine to an operation stop state whereby the idle stop is performed step .

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. when the accelerator pedal is stepped on during the idle stop and thereby makes the accelerator pedal opening AP not smaller than the restart determining opening degree APST it is determined that the restart conditions of the engine are satisfied so that an idle stop flag F IDLSTP is reset to 0 step and a restart flag F RESTART is set to 1 step .

Next it is determined whether or not a hydraulic pump operation flag F BR is equal to 1 step . In a braking force control process in described hereinafter the hydraulic pump operation flag F BR is set to 1 when the hydraulic pump is in operation for increasing the braking force of the vehicle V. If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the hydraulic pump is in operation a cranking flag F CRK is set to 0 step and the cranking is inhibited step followed by terminating the present process. Thus if the restart conditions are satisfied when the hydraulic pump is in operation the cranking is inhibited.

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. if the hydraulic pump is not in operation the cranking flag F CRK is set to 1 step and the cranking is performed step followed by terminating the present process.

After the restart conditions are satisfied as described above the answer to the question of the step becomes negative NO and in this case the process proceeds to a step wherein it is determined whether or not the restart flag F RESTART is equal to 1. After the restart conditions are satisfied the answer to the question of the step becomes affirmative YES and in this case it is determined whether or not the cranking flag F CRK is equal to 1 step .

If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. if the cranking is inhibited the process proceeds to the steps et seq. That is if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES F BR 1 i.e. if the operation of the hydraulic pump has not been terminated the cranking inhibited state is maintained by performing the steps and . On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is negative NO F BR 0 i.e. if the operation of the hydraulic pump has been terminated the cranking inhibited state is cancelled by performing the steps and wherein the cranking flag F CRK is set to 1 and the cranking is started respectively.

In a case where the cranking has not been inhibited or after the cranking inhibited state is cancelled as described above the answer to the question of the step becomes affirmative YES . In this case the process proceeds to a step wherein it is determined whether or not the engine speed NE is not lower than an idle speed NEIDL. If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. NE

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the engine speed NE becomes not lower than the idle speed NEIDL by cranking it is determined that the restart is completed so that the restart flag F RESTART is reset to 0 step and the cranking is terminated step followed by terminating the present process. After the restart of the engine is thus completed the answer to the question of the step becomes negative NO and hence the present process is immediately terminated.

Next a braking force increasing necessity determination process for the vehicle V will be described with reference to . This process determines whether or not the braking force needs to be increased e.g. by the operation of the hydraulic pump in order to compensate for the shortage of the braking force of the brake system during an idle stop or a restart of the engine and is executed at predetermined time intervals.

In the present process first in a step it is determined whether or not the idle stop flag F IDLSTP or the restart flag F RESTART is equal to 1. If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. if the engine is neither in idle stop nor being restarted the present process is immediately terminated.

If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the engine is either in idle stop or being restarted a slope ASLP of the road surface on which the vehicle V is stopped at the time is calculated step . The calculation of the road surface slope ASLP is performed based on the forward rearward acceleration GFR detected by the acceleration sensor .

Next by searching a map shown in according to the calculated road surface slope ASLP a predetermined pressure PREF is calculated step . In this map the predetermined pressure PREF is set to the minimum value when the road surface slope ASLP is equal to 0 which means the road surface is level and is set to a higher value as the slope is larger in both the cases of ascending slope and descending slope.

Next it is determined whether or not the detected wheel cylinder pressure PWC is higher than the set predetermined pressure PREF step . If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. PWC PREF the wheel cylinder pressure PWC is insufficient and hence it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V needs to be increased and to indicate this fact a braking force increasing request flag F BFREQ is set to 1 step followed by terminating the present process.

If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES it is determined whether or not the vehicle speed VP is approximately equal to 0 step . If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO it means that the vehicle V is actually moving even slightly it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V needs to be increased to prevent the vehicle V from moving further so that the process proceeds to the step wherein the braking force increasing request flag F BFREQ is set to 1.

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the wheel cylinder pressure PWC the predetermined pressure PREF holds and also the vehicle speed VP is approximately equal to 0 it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V does not need to be increased so that the braking force increasing request flag F BFREQ is set to 0 step followed by terminating the present process.

Next a braking force control process for the vehicle V will be described with reference to . This process controls the braking force of the vehicle V during an idle stop and a restart of the engine according to the result of the braking force increasing necessity determination obtained from the process and is executed at predetermined time intervals.

In the present process first in a step it is determined whether or not the idle stop flag F IDLSTP is equal to 1. If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. the engine is in idle stop the brake system is controlled to the above mentioned retention mode to retain the braking force of the vehicle V step followed by terminating the present process.

If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. if the engine is not in idle stop the process proceeds to a step wherein it is determined whether or not the braking force increasing request flag F BFREQ is equal to 1. If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. if it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V does not need to be increased the present process is immediately terminated.

On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V needs to be increased it is determined whether or not the hydraulic pump operation flag F BR is equal to 1 step . If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO i.e. if the hydraulic pump has not been activated yet after the hydraulic pump operation flag F BR is set to 1 step and a pump operation time period TMBR that is counted with a timer of an up count type is reset to 0 step the hydraulic motor is driven to start the operation of the hydraulic pump step followed by terminating the present process.

By thus operating the hydraulic pump and controlling the hydraulic circuit of the brake system to the above described pressurization mode the brake fluid pressure pressurized by the hydraulic pump is supplied to the wheel cylinder via the hydraulic circuit whereby the brake fluid pressure within the wheel cylinder is increased to increase the braking force of the vehicle V.

If the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. the hydraulic pump has already been activated it is determined whether or not the pump operation time period TMBR is not shorter than a predetermined time period TBRREF step . If the answer to the question of the step is negative NO the process proceeds to the step to continue the operation of the hydraulic pump . On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the predetermined time period TBRREF has elapsed after starting the operation of the hydraulic pump the hydraulic pump is stopped step followed by terminating the present process.

If the restart conditions of the engine are satisfied during operation of the hydraulic pump time point t the restart flag F RESTART is set to 1 step in . However since the hydraulic pump is in operation the cranking is inhibited at this time point steps to .

Then when the predetermined time period TBRREF elapses after starting the operation of the hydraulic pump time point t the operation of the hydraulic pump is terminated steps in and the cranking inhibited state is cancelled to start the cranking steps in .

Then when the engine speed NE reaches the idle speed NEIDL time point t the cranking is terminated at this time point steps in and it is determined that the restart of the engine is completed so that the restart flag F RESTART is reset to 0 whereby thereafter the control shifts to normal control. Note that although not shown in a case where the hydraulic pump is not in operation when the restart conditions are satisfied the cranking is not inhibited but is started concurrently with satisfaction of the restart conditions steps in .

As described above according to the present embodiment if the restart conditions of the engine from an idle stop state are satisfied during operation of the hydraulic pump for use in increasing the braking force of the vehicle V the cranking is inhibited to continue the operation of the hydraulic pump . This makes it possible to positively increase the braking force of the vehicle V by preventing the battery voltage VB from being lowered due to the cranking to ensure the stable operation of the hydraulic pump and hence it is possible to positively prevent the vehicle V during a stop from moving.

Further it is possible to ensure more stable operation of the hydraulic pump by inhibiting the cranking until the operation of the hydraulic pump is terminated and it is possible to start the cranking as quickly as possible by starting the cranking when the operation of the hydraulic pump is terminated to thereby restart the engine without any difficulty.

Further the hydraulic pump is stopped when the predetermined time period TBRREF has elapse after starting the operation of the hydraulic pump and hence it is possible to more positively increase the braking force of the vehicle V by securing a sufficient operation time period thereof.

Further although in the embodiment the above mentioned predetermined time period TBRREF is a fixed value the predetermined time period TBRREF may be set according to the calculated road surface slope ASLP. In this case e.g. similarly to the case of the predetermined pressure PREF shown in the predetermined time period TBRREF is set to the minimum value when the road surface slope ASLP is equal to 0 i.e. the road surface is level and is set to a larger value as the slope is larger. This makes it possible to further properly increase the braking force of the vehicle V by operating the hydraulic pump for a longer time period as the mobility of the vehicle V is higher due to the influence of the road surface slope.

Further since the hydraulic pump is activated only in a case where it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V needs to be increased differently from the conventional system it is possible to perform an efficient operation of the hydraulic pump without wasting power which in turn makes it possible to improve the fuel economy of the vehicle V.

Further in the determination process in it is determined that the braking force of the vehicle V needs to be increased by the hydraulic pump when the wheel cylinder pressure PWC is lowered to not higher than the predetermined pressure PREF or when the vehicle speed VP is not equal to 0. Therefore it is possible to effectively obtain the required braking force by properly operating the hydraulic pump according to a lowered state of the actual wheel cylinder pressure PWC and a moving state of the vehicle V. Further the above mentioned predetermined pressure PREF is set according to the road surface slope ASLP it is possible to properly operate the hydraulic pump according to the mobility of the vehicle V.

Next a braking force control process for the vehicle V according to a variation of the embodiment will be described with reference to . As is apparent from a comparison with this variation is distinguished from the embodiment only in that processing in a step A is changed from that in the corresponding step in whereby the wheel cylinder pressure PWC is used as a reference for determining a stop timing of the hydraulic pump instead of the pump operation time period TMBR of the embodiment.

More specifically if the answer to the question of the step is affirmative YES i.e. if the hydraulic pump is in operation in the step A it is determined whether or not the wheel cylinder pressure PWC is not lower than a sum of the predetermined pressure PREF and a predetermined value PH as a hysteresis PREF PH . If the answer to the question of the step A is negative NO the process proceeds to the step to continue the operation of the hydraulic pump . On the other hand if the answer to the question of the step A is affirmative YES i.e. PWC PREF PH holds the hydraulic pump is stopped step .

Therefore according to this variation it is possible to stop the hydraulic pump in a state where the wheel cylinder pressure PWC has actually and sufficiently recovered after activating the hydraulic pump and hence it is possible to positively increase the braking force of the vehicle V and efficiently operate the hydraulic pump .

Note that the present invention is by no means limited to the above described embodiment but can be practiced in various forms. For example although in the above described embodiment and variation thereof the hydraulic pump is used as a braking force increasing device for increasing the braking force of the vehicle V this may be replaced by the electric brake . In this case it is possible to obtain the same advantageous effects as described above by controlling the activation and stop of the electric brake in the same manner as in the above described case of the hydraulic pump .

Further although in the embodiments each wheel W of the vehicle V is provided with the disc brake with regard to the rear wheels WRL and WRR instead of the disc brake a drum brake may be used and in this case with regard to the electric brake as well one for drum brake may be used.

Further although in the embodiments the present invention is applied to the gasoline engine installed on the vehicle this is not limitative but it can be applied to various engines other than the gasoline engine e.g. a diesel engine and further it is possible to change details of the configuration of the embodiment within the spirit and scope of the present invention.

The present invention is very useful in positively increasing the braking force of the vehicle during an idle stop and positively preventing the vehicle during stop from moving.
