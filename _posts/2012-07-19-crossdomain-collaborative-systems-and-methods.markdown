The secure connection over the Internet comprises a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS connection. Files associated with the cross domain collaboration are stored in a secure data store and encrypted with one of Triple Data Encryption Standard T DES and Advanced Encryption Standard AES encryption.

In yet another exemplary embodiment a secure computer system connected to a plurality of users includes a cross domain server with a network connection to the Internet an authentication database communicatively coupled to the hosted server a data store communicatively coupled to the cross domain server wherein the data store comprises data storage for a cross domain collaboration a plurality of users each with a networked device connected to the Internet wherein the networked device comprises a biometric authentication device and each of the plurality of users comprises a security level wherein the cross domain server is configured to host the cross domain collaboration between the plurality of users through a secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS connection to each of the plurality of users and through biometric authentication of each of the plurality of users prior to accessing the online collaboration and wherein information is displayed to each of the plurality of users based upon a security level associated with each of the plurality of users.

In various exemplary embodiments the present invention relates to cross domain electronic collaboration systems and methods for secure and authentic collaboration between a plurality of users using a combination of biometric security a separate and secure network infrastructure management processes encrypted electronic storage various security rules and cross domain collaborative templates. Advantageously the present invention utilizes a hosted or cloud based solution for a plurality of users to interact with one another view various file types and real time communications in a secure and verified manner.

Referring to a high level network diagram illustrates a message exchange of two users interacting in the Public Internet versus a Private Bio Enable Network according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In this diagram the users represent a person organization etc. with the ability to send electronic messages over the Internet . Electronic messages can include electronic mail email file exchange such as through email attachments or file transfer protocol FTP audio visual messaging instant messaging text messaging and the like. Disadvantageously conventional message exchanges over the Public Internet includes minimal security unvetted senders recipients lack of bio identify verification limited proof of delivery limited encryption limited large file support substantial virus malware exposure endless spam and the like.

The present invention provides a biometric enabled point to point encrypted certified electronic messaging system over the Private Bio Enable Network providing a worldwide community of users with the highest levels of identity verification security and privacy and proof of delivery when exchanging important high value email messages and files. Messages can be in text audio and visual formats with large attachments e.g. up to four gigabytes in size but larger sizes are also contemplated . Recipients can either read the sender s email text message hear the sender speak the message or watch and hear them speak. Advantageously the present invention provides certified email or other electronic messaging senders and recipients with the highest levels of Biometric Identify Verification Security and Privacy and Proof of Delivery. Additionally the present invention supports various message formats as well. By utilizing state of the art biometrics initially registered fingerprint scans the ultimate in identify verification which confidently answers the question Is that really you Various levels of vetting are provided via Credit Card authorization fingerprint scan Notary Public certification phone number address email address and the like. By utilizing its own private fully encrypted network and infrastructure for exchanging personal messages i.e. the Private Bio Enable Network the present invention avoids the privacy and security problems that come with many everyday public email systems and their use of the low security and vulnerable public Internet .

The present invention provides enhanced Proof of Delivery by utilizing its email management processes for email composition and logging recording all related delivery events as they occur such as when the sender s certified email was sent when an alert notification eDelivery email form SMS IVR . . . was sent to their recipient s if and when the certified email was signed for and how they signed e.g. by fingerprint scan or electronic signature this is called delivery acceptance and if and when an attachment was viewed and or downloaded. The present invention also can utilize three sender options for creating a message itself 1 text words 2 audio voice message and 3 visual video with sound . Again recipients can either read the sender s email text message hear the sender speak the message or watch and hear them speak it. This multi option set of formats is not the simple attaching of text the written word audio voice or visual video files to an email message. These message options relate to integration with and are specific to the main purpose of the email message itself and are not just attachments to an email. The addition of audio and visual format options to the standard text format option provides senders more effectiveness more preciseness more personalization and more flexibility e.g. no keyboard use necessary in creating their communications with the intended recipient.

The inventors have an initial preferred embodiment of a company a website a network an infrastructure a series of servers an email management system and an operator to support the implementation of a certified email system with the main processes described below. Such website network infrastructure servers and email management system is collectively the first ever biometric enabled point to point encrypted certified email system providing a worldwide community of users with a complete solution including the highest levels of identity verification security and privacy proof of delivery and effectiveness in communications when exchanging important confidential high value email messages and attachments. These email messages can be communicated in text audio and visual formats and include large attachments for example 4 gigabytes or larger in size.

It s important to point out that there are usually two email systems used with the Invention. First there is the registered user s current everyday email system e.g. Hotmail AOL MSN Outlook etc. if they have one where they will receive alerts called eDelivery forms from the Invention that say you ve got certified mail . Note such alert notices can also be sent to a user s cell phone via SMS Short Message System or to their land line phone via IVR Integrated Voice Response or equivalent if such alert options are selected by the user. Second there is the Invention s separate private high security email network and infrastructure including secure servers that such users utilize when actually sending receiving tracking and managing email messages and attachments via the Invention s website referred to as website or system or the Invention s website or system in the process discussion below . Just as the Post Office FedEx and UPS uses completely different processes and infrastructures for their certified mail package delivery services the Invention uses a similar separation concept in its management and transport of certified email messages and attachments.

Referring to a flowchart illustrates various processes associated with creating sending and managing certified electronic messages according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. These processes are executed on one or more computers or servers connected to a network such as the Internet. Collectively the processes enable a user to send a certified electronic message to another user. A Home process as illustrated in is the starting point for users of the present invention. Note that processes through are all illustrated in . The Home process allows users to become more informed as to the present inventions features functions and purpose through access to Frequently Asked Questions FAQ s About Us Contact Us and How It Works .

To become a user of the present invention a visitor selects a User Registration process to fill out required user information including for example an existing email address they want to use as their User ID when logging into the website and a password. This process allows users to register to officially use the Invention and is designed to do initial vetting of the users. Other information gathered can include name address phone number and credit card number to insure the operator has a good understanding of who is using the Invention. Other user information is gathered in other processes for example a user s fingerprint and a Notary Public certification. They can also receive a registration confirmation notice at the email address they supplied or by SMS or IVR if such option is selected by user and they will have to respond in order to activate their user status and be able to login to the website going forward. If they do not receive an email confirmation notice they should be sure that their spam filter has not intercepted it for some reason that happens occasionally when using the email notice option.

The present invention s certified email messages and attachments are private and confidential between sender and recipient and its registered users are vetted in many ways credit card fingerprint notary certification phone number address email address and more . And such vetting levels are displayed by the system to both senders and recipients. The system does not allow mass marketing companies who send large numbers of emails to recipients that they may or may not know to become registered users of the website. These companies and spammers in general have no ability to send large numbers of emails in the Invention which has purposely limited the number recipients per email to dissuade any such attempt by any registered user. The present invention works on the premise that vetted user senders identified at various levels are far less likely to intentionally send a virus spyware or other malware in their emails and attachments. A registered user s current everyday email address is often used as their User ID in the Invention s website. Their cell phone number or landline phone number can also be used as a User ID in the system as well as a user selected ID. These are also a key in its databases and can only be changed by special system request.

Registration and usage of the website or system can require paying a monthly or annual fee or a per unit per email fee can be charged. There are many ways to charge for such services. Registered users of the Invention can initially have service levels as follows which are subject to change 1 unlimited sending and receiving of local and international emails via the system each with a 4 GB attachment maximum 2 10 20 GB in long term attachment storage and 3 100 GB in monthly download bandwidth. Additional storage and bandwidth can be purchased.

To get started after a new user s status is activated the user selects a User Login process to sign in and start a user session. After login the user automatically proceeds to a My Dashboard process further described below . This requires the User ID and password to be provided during the registration process. Once the user installs an approved fingerprint scanner and registers their actual fingerprint with the system and optionally confirms it with a separate Notary Public certification which activates the biometric features of the system then users can scan their fingerprint in lieu of entering the password. As a bio registered user that uses their fingerprint scanner to login a recipient sees that the sender is at one of the highest levels of vetting in the system and their emails are identified as being biometrically certified .

To send or compose a certified message or mail the user selects Send Compose Certified Mail processes to compose certified email messages and send each to a set number of recipients at a time. After initially registering it is suggested that a new user send the system a certified Hello email. The user can send one to themselves as well to experience the recipient delivery acceptance process and add an Access Code a secret code only they and their recipients know to make it even more secure. The access code is pre determined between sender and recipient and can be used in combination with an electronic signature a fingerprint or both. When users select the Send Compose Certified Mail processes and begin with the process then proceed to the process to create their certified email and identify the recipients. There are a variety of reasons for this two step compose process including the need to determine if the specified recipients are already registers users and if they have their fingerprint registered as well which would give the sender more options to specify their recipients delivery acceptance rules. They can enter a text version of the email subject line and message other formats described below at this point and identify all intended recipients. If such an alert option is selected in a process for setting alerts the email subject line is also displayed in the alert notice eDelivery form generated in process sent to the recipient to inform them that have certified email waiting for delivery. The subject line gives them an idea of what the email concerns.

Because the system informs the user sender if they have entered an email address for a registered or unregistered recipient as they proceed from processes to senders can then set the delivery acceptance rules for each recipient and select their attachments in process . These delivery acceptance rules can include 1 an electronic signature the default 2 an access code a secret code or password only known by the sender and the recipient 3 a fingerprint scan to insure the recipient s identity note the system knows if a recipient has activated this biometric capability and 4 the sender can insist that a non registered recipient registers before taking delivery of their certified email. For non registered recipients the sender is required to spell their name first and last for the system so the electronic signature process knows what name to check for during delivery acceptance.

Audio and visual email message format options also created on the Compose Certified Email process are described below. Email Message Format Options the Send Compose Certified Email process supports three options text audio and visual for the email message formats that users can select plus any number of attachments in process . This adds flexibility and precision to a user s email message exchanges as previously explained herein. So after recipients take delivery of a sender s email they can read the words written by the sender hear the sender speak their words or see and hear them speak their words. The numerous combinations of text audio and visual formats presented in an integrated and coordinated fashion within the Invention s certified email system create an appealing and powerful way to send email messages including 1 a text message by itself 2 text message and attachment 3 audio message 4 audio message and attachment 5 visual message and 6 visual message and attachment. The combinations are many and ultimately get to this combination a text message an audio message a visual message and an attachment one or many .

In the Attachment process a sub process within Send Compose Email Message process the Invention s system allows for the attachments in many formats such as PDF DOC pictures voice files movie files virtually any of the formats can become attachments within the system s secure environment. In this system the user is essentially uploading their attachments to the Invention s secure server rather then attempting to send them to and risk clogging up of the recipient s everyday email system. This is particularly a problem with very large files causing many such emails to be rejected a.k.a. Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender . When a recipient receives i.e. takes delivery of the system s certified email message in process they also can take delivery of the attachments in process via process if supplied by the sender. The sender can also designate whether the attachment can to be viewed only or if the recipient cam also be allowed to actually download it see process . If view only the file does not physically leave the invention s secure servers and as a result is not transferred to the recipient s computer. Each of these actions is logged as they occur to provide the sender proof of delivery and proof of what files were delivered and how.

Alert Notifications i.e. You ve got certified email alert notices are sent in a Notification Alert to Recipient process to all recipients based on the alert options set by the user in Set Alert Options process . Alert notices can be sent potentially multiple times to insure prompt pick up via email cell phone using SMS or landline phone using IVR . Alerts sent via email can include if such option is selected by user a Uniform Resource Locator URL link back to the Invention s website where the user can gain access to the certified email and its attachments. But first they must go through a Delivery Acceptance process . If such option is selected by the user in the process alerts can also be sent to users of the system to indicate that activity has occurred on certified emails and attachments they have previously sent. This could include for example that a recipient has taken delivery of e.g. signed for delivery of the email the user sent them. This saves the user from having to log into the system to determine that this has occurred. For textual audio and visual email messages sent by users in the Send Compose Certified Email processes such certified messages can also be delivered directly to a cell phone or cell phone computer device like the Apple iPhone or landline phone via IVR as long as the recipient can prove who they are and can meet the delivery requirements e.g. identity verification set by the sender in process .

Users can select a View Sender Log process or a View Recipient Log process to monitor the sending and delivery process for certified emails. Remember when users send a certified email via the website an alert notice is also sent to their recipient s email address in the process which contains a you ve got certified mail notice and a URL link back to the system s separate high security infrastructure where they can sign for and take delivery of the sender s private email message in the Delivery Acceptance process e.g. electronically sign for delivery similar to the FedEx or UPS process when they come to a recipient s front door and any attachments the sender may have also sent. After delivery acceptance users can view hear or see the certified email message in a View Email Message process and access related attachments in View and or Download Attachments process .

The sender and recipient logs the processes in the Invention provide valuable tracking information. They tell the sender and recipient when the user s certified email was sent when an alert notice email was sent to the recipient s if and when the certified email was signed for called delivery acceptance process and if and when it was viewed and or downloaded. Note if a user is logged in process to the website and receives an email from another registered user of the system or from themselves when testing the Invention they can take delivery process of the email from within the website directly from the Recipient Log process just as if they had clicked the link provided on the alert notice email from the sender if so selected by user in the Set Alert Options process . Note such alert notices can also be sent via cell phone using SMS or landline phone using IVR or equivalent if so selected in the process .

From the View Sender Log process senders can recall or resend in process their previously sent certified email messages and attachments sent via the Invention. This gives the sender the ability to quickly react if they made a mistake or if the recipient wanted the alert notice sent to a different address or in a different format. In other everyday email systems there is no certainty that a sender can successfully recall pull back an email before it is placed for viewing in the recipient s email system especially if there are multiple recipients . This Invention does allow the sender to recall the certified email and be certain by viewing the related sender log entries in processes that a specific recipient which could be one of many has or has not yet seen the contents.

Print Log and Proof of Delivery Document Users can print a Proof of Delivery a.k.a. Proof of Service document in process by going to the View Sender Log process and selecting a specific email that was previously sent and then selecting Access . This access log receipt process displays the Email and Attachment Access Log with all the delivery activity events listed above on this certified email to date. Select the Print POD Log process to print the Proof of Delivery document which shows the original certified email contents and lists attachment s . It also lists all recipients and the delivery acceptance requirements that were set by the sender. Also a log of events will be displayed that shows all relevant delivery activity for the selected email. Proof of Delivery emails and CD s or other media can also be available to allow the actual attached files and voice and visual video files be made available to those want to prove the circumstances related to such certified emails and attachments sent via the Invention. This Proof of Delivery can potentially be used for various purposes such as for example legal service and the like.

Fingerprint Scanners are utilized in the present invention i.e. refer to the Biometric Device Setup process for general information on all such devices and their activation. The Invention s system supports fingerprint scanners in its biometric identity verification processes and can be purchased via the website s operators or elsewhere on the Internet. Refer to Where to Buy Fingerprint Scanner process for specific information on where and how to buy such a device. The Invention can support a U.are.U 4000B USB Reader from DigitalPersona Inc. of Redwood City Calif. and may support other vendors devices in the future. The system also supports other models of DigitalPersona s biometric product line including those that are built into many popular computer laptops like those from Dell and Lenovo previously IBM . If not a built in as just mentioned the system s users have to buy specific approved fingerprint scanner devices from the Invention s operators or as directed in process because such devices may have to utilize drivers modified to support the Invention s unique browser based biometric implementation and operational processes. If users already own a 4000B USB reader they may need to contact the system s operator for special instructions on installation refer to process . Note until users have an approved scanner ignore bypass the fingerprint process on the Login process . In the interim registered users can use for example their email address and private password to complete login. Once a biometric identity capability is implemented this option to use a password may or may no be approved based on several variables and user set options.

A user can select a Registration Update process to make basic changes in user information. Some user information cannot be changed on this screen and as a result users have to contact the operator to help with that change e.g. email address as the user s User ID . This is necessary because this has become a key field in a database and must be changed in a special process. Notice that the website can be optionally gathering the user s cell phone number as well because the system can be sending text alerts messages in the Notification Alert to Recipient process to cell phones and to land line phones as telephone companies implement this and equivalent features in the future based on user options set in the Set Alert Options process .

A user can select the Biometric Device Setup process to setup and activate biometric devices supported by the Invention. Fingerprint scanner software drivers can be downloaded and the device activated in an Activate Fingerprint Scanner process to support the installation on the user s computer. And a user s actual fingerprints can be initially registered in a Register User Fingerprint s process and subsequently updated changed in an Update User Fingerprint process . This means the user s fingerprint is scanned and a numeric representation is stored for use in the Invention s matching and identification algorithms. As other devices are added to the Invention s biometric capabilities the process can be expanded. Note the system does not store the actual fingerprint image for any of its registered users rather a numeric representation.

The My Dashboard process provides a view of the registered user s personalized Dashboard which provides a high level control window for the user s many global communications activities in the system. The Dashboard is where users land go to after each Login process and after the Send Compose Certified Email processes and both View Log processes . The Invention uses a window on this screen to inform all registered users with various news and update items. The Invention can also provide a ticker tape rolling window here to display and monitor as they occur the delivery activity events of many certified emails simultaneously and provide other insightful real time statistics about the user s entire experience with the Invention. Lastly select a Suggestions process to let the websites operators know of user suggestions and problems as they occur. The Invention provides FAQ s that are very helpful in answering user questions. A Log Out process is used to log out and terminate the current user session of the Invention s website.

In an exemplary embodiment a method of communication between a sender and a recipient initiates once a sender logs onto SenditCertified.com a private network and identifies themselves. The sender composes a message via text audio and or video format on a network device. A network device is a computer a cellular phone a PDA or other type device capable of communicating with a server or computer. The sender then seals the message via a biometric identification secret access code electronic signature or by independent verification. In other words the sender seals the message by identifying himself or herself preferably by biometric identification. Thereafter the server of the private network encrypts the message and the sender sends it to the recipient over the private network. The private network does not use the Internet does not use server to server duplication or store and forward protocol. The encrypted message proceeds from the sender s network device to the private network server where it waits delivery to the recipient. The server notifies the recipient of the message and states the conditions under which the recipient can take delivery of the message. After the recipient meets the conditions to take delivery the server un encrypts the message and the recipient takes delivery of the message via a second network device which may be under the control of the recipient.

The server tracks the progress of the send message records the tracking information such as time and place sent size of message type of message conditions of delivery and recipient identification such as name secret access code biometric identification information and or other information of recipient. The biometric identification may be fingerprinting iris scan facial recognition or DNA. Preferably the biometric information is fingerprinting. Additionally the sender and recipient may confirm their identity via an independent vetting process with said private network. The independent vetting process may include electronic signature secret access code or other independent information such as credit card numbers answering secret questions driver s license and or passport or social security information.

Referring to a flowchart illustrates various processes interacting with an Authentication Database Server and a Hosted Internet Server for providing secure certified electronic messaging according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As described herein the secure certified electronic message can be referred to as an ePackage that is a combination of pre organized communication components e.g. a package containing a text a voice and or video message and attached files . An ePackage may have large file attachments e.g. four gigabytes in size. With messages in text audio and video formats ePackage recipients may either read the senders textual messages hear the senders speak the messages or watch and hear them.

The present invention is built as a private network over the Internet e.g. using secure connections over the Internet rather than as an add on to prior email protocols. The various process functions described herein can be executed on the Hosted Internet Server and users interact with the Hosted Internet Server via a web browser and as a result ePackages never leave the control of the Hosted Internet Server . Interactive capabilities are accomplished using Active Server Pages ASP code and HyperText Markup Language HTML for screen rendering. Alternative embodiments may use PHP Net Java or other Internet environments. Data for user sessions are stored using a database management system for example Structured Query Language SQL server.

When a registered user logs into the Hosted Internet Server to send an ePackage a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS connection is established between the user s computer and the Hosted Internet Server . This layer of security can be enhanced by certified encryption e.g. VeriSign or GeoTrust certifications. Here the present invention can use Transport Layer Security TLS and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer SSL as cryptographic protocols that provide security and data integrity for communications over networks such as the Internet. TLS and SSL encrypt the segments of network connections at the Transport Layer end to end. The secure connection includes a secure web address and the user interacts with the Hosted Internet Server via a browser e.g. Internet Explorer Firefox Netscape Safari and the like. The system prompts the user via a browser to enter login data a part of which is the user s fingerprint. Alternatively the system may accept a password from a user but then the system marks messages for the session with a lesser authentication level.

In step the Hosted Internet Server can request a fingerprint scan of the user by displaying a fingerprint icon. A link to the Hosted Internet Server can be pending waiting for the fingerprint scan. When a finger of a user who desires to log in and send a message is scanned the Hosted Internet Server receives a fingerprint image or numerical representation of the fingerprint from the user. The fingerprint scan can be accomplished via an off the shelf biometric scanner. In some embodiments the fingerprint scanner is a USB device such as the U.are.U 4000B USB Reader from Digjtalpersona Inc. attached to a personal computer. In other embodiments the scanner is built into a person computer such as an Upek built into a Dell laptop. In prior systems the results from scanners would go into a PC or a LAN. In the present invention the results of the scan are transmitted to a web based Hosted Internet Server via a browser interface. Thus the system is available for use worldwide.

The fingerprint scan results in an image of the user s fingerprint. The process can convert the image scanned to an index i.e. a long numeric number that uniquely identifies the finger. In some embodiments the conversion is done with a hash index and public and private key encryption. In step the process generally uses a standard public key private key technique to safeguard a user password. Accordingly the index created from the users fingerprint is encrypted as further described below regarding step of . The present invention uses a three tier procedure to accomplish authentication. Tier 1 The local computer reads the scan and creates a numeric key public key . Tier 2 The public key is transmitted to the Hosted Internet Server . Tier 3 The Hosted Internet Server transmits a request to the Authentication Database Server and the public key must correctly match the private key to get authentication. This very secure process if identity is authenticated allows the registered user further access to the system.

After successful identity authentication the user is inside a secure area of the process and can access multiple functions. The user can choose next to compose an ePackage. As shown in step the user composes an ePackage. The user enters creates or assembles the components of the ePackage via a web based graphical user interface GUI . In step the process stores the ePackage components into an SQL database on the Hosted Internet Server . The process then allows the user sender to perform other tasks e.g. review a log of previously sent ePackages provided by the process in step . The process may also receive a logoff indication from the user.

After the user submits the ePackage in step the process sends an alert notification to the recipients chosen by the sender during the ePackage composition step. Each recipient receives an alert as indicated by the sender. The alerts may be in the form of e.g. an email alert a cell phone text messaging alert a voice alert or a combination thereof based on the senders choice and the capabilities of the recipient. The recipient may either log in to the system as a user or the recipient could click on an alert link to the system that was sent to them in step . The alert link may show the recipient only the sender s name and contact information and the sender s identity authentication level so that the recipient can make an informed decision about taking delivery of the actual ePackage.

In step the process allows an ePackage recipient to access the system. The step is analogous to step used to allow senders access to the system. When the recipient logs in or clicks the alert link they are now able to take delivery of the ePackage but must first be authenticated in accordance with the identity verification requirements requested by the sender. The sender may have requested an electronic signature an access code a fingerprint scan another identifier or a combination thereof. The system will then authenticate the recipient to make sure they meet the requested identity authentication level. If a fingerprint is requested in step the process displays a fingerprint icon and a link to the server will be pending and waiting for the recipient s scan. In step the process then authenticates the identity of a recipient in a manner essentially similar to that used in step to authenticate the identity of a sender.

After successful recipient authentication in step the system presents the ePackage for access via the user s browser and the user may read the message text listen to the sender s voice recording by simply clicking a speaker icon or view the sender s video by clicking a video icon. In step the user may then choose to view or download the attachments that the sender may have included. If the recipient is a registered user they may then perform other system tasks or simply logoff.

During each of the steps in the biometric ePackage process the process writes an event log record into the SQL database. In step the process provides senders with real time status tracking information of their ePackages via the sender log. The process may optionally send an activity notification to the sender for example by text message alert when the sender s ePackage was received accessed downloaded by the intended recipient. In step the process provides senders with detailed logs of what activities each recipient has taken. Senders log in to the system via steps and to access this information. These logs may be printed or electronically sent to provide evidence of proof of delivery and proof of the content of messages and files in an ePackage. In step the process provides ePackage recipients with status tracking information analogous to that provided senders in step . Recipients must be registered users to view their recipient logs to see their previous ePackages and to access proof of delivery.

Referring to a flowchart illustrates various processes interacting with the Authentication Database Server and the Hosted Internet Server for providing biometric authentication according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For the process to allow a user to access the Hosted Internet Server with a high level of identity authentication the process must have previously registered both a scanner device and the user s fingerprint image. The process registers users to access the system in step . When a user of the system initially registers it includes specifying a password. When a user is ready to enhance their service from password level verification to fingerprint scan authentication they access a my account area of the system. In the my account area the process creates and updates user information such as email address phone numbers and mailing address. In step the process activates one or more fingerprint scanners for the previously registered user. The scanner may be a built in model or a USB model that can be attached to a computer. The process activates the scanner by running a program on the local computer. The program checks for compatibility of the local computer and the scanner. Compatibility may include information such as the computer manufacturer and driver type for the fingerprint reader. The program acquires this information by for example reading machine register device records. The installation program may install any missing software components along with scanner client software.

After successful completion of step the system can use the activated scanner device with the user s account. The system allows scanners to be physically interchangeable but the computer must have the proper drivers for its scanner type. After scanner activation in step the process registers a fingerprint image of the user. In this step the user s fingerprint scanner is started the user is requested to select a finger and make multiple scans. Repeated scans help ensure that the process creates a good repeatable public and private key for matching algorithms. The private key is then stored on the Authentication Database Server and the public key is stored in the user record on the Hosted Internet Server . The user is now registered to access the system and to send and receive ePackages with identity authenticated by fingerprint.

Although fingerprints are the form of biometric identification described herein other biometric identifiers are also contemplated by the present invention. For example other biometric identifiers can include iris scans facial scans retinal scans or DNA indicia. These biometric identifiers may be used individually or in combination. Additionally a combination of biometric identifiers may be used along with smart cards or other devices that may be carried by a user. For example peripheral devices can be included to provide fingerprint capture. Additionally peripheral devices can provide retinal scans as well.

Referring to a diagram of a network illustrates secure certified electronic exchange according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention. illustrates the network showing secure message exchange between users i.e. a message exchange between two users. The present invention contemplates other scenarios as well such as a message exchange between a plurality of users to one or more users.

In the present invention all users message senders and recipients communicate with the Hosted Internet Server utilizing Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS connections over the Internet or other types of secure connections. This differs from conventional electronic message exchange where email messages are sent between the users mail servers. The ePackages are created and sent received to from the Hosted Internet Server through HTTPS connections and thus are always secure. HTTPS is a combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP and a cryptographic protocol e.g. a true 512 bit SSL . Existing web browsers i.e. Internet Explorer Firefox Netscape Safari Chrome Opera and the like are configured with integrated HTTPS support i.e. the users can directly access the Hosted Internet Server over HTTPS with their web browsers. Accordingly the present invention provides transmission storage path and identity verification.

The HTTPS connections encrypt a session with a digital certificate i.e. HTTP over SSL Secure Sockets Layer which can be used by Web browsers and HTTPS capable client programs. A secure website first sends a user s browser a public encryption key which is used to construct another unique non public encryption key. This key which is known only to the web server and the user is then used to protect all subsequent transfers of information. In practice SSL provides a secure tunnel between two points on the Internet. Files transferred along this tunnel are wrapped in a layer of encryption that makes them impossible for third parties to view or compromise. Using this SSL solution the present invention can ensure complete data confidentiality. The encryption methods used are based on keys only available to the user and the Hosted Internet Server making it virtually impossible to decode the data sent even if it is intercepted. This SSL solution also ensures data integrity no outside source can modify data as it travels between an end user and the Hosted Internet Server . If data is changed in transit the protocol automatically recognizes the modification and asks the client to resubmit the file.

The network illustrates an example where the user sends an ePackage to the user . Here the user logs into the Server over the HTTPS connection and composes text audio video and or attachments that are stored on the Server . The user is notified as specified by the user and the user logs into the Server over the HTTPS connection to view and or download the ePackage.

As shown in the present invention does not utilize the traditional store and forward method of electronic messaging which can leave copies of emails on multiple servers around the Internet. The present invention encrypts ePackage contents sends them over a private pathway of the Internet to the Hosted Internet Server and never interacts with another email system. The recipient then downloads the encrypted message through another private pathway to their own computer. All ePackages can be encrypted with T DES or with the Advanced Encryption Standard AES . Additionally this encryption can prevent network operators of the Hosted Internet Server from viewing the contents of stored ePackages.

From a physical perspective the servers may be located at the same or separate location and the users may be connected to the servers through any type of Internet connection wireless DSL cable modem T1 T3 etc. . In an exemplary embodiment the servers are located in a SAS 70 Type II Certified Data Center with security redundant power redundant HVAC heating ventilation air conditioning etc. Further the data center may include network security protection that prevents denial of service DOS attacks and uses traffic profiling and anomaly detection capabilities to manage and secure connections from the servers to the Internet to pinpoint and troubleshoot network attacks to monitor our servers and applications and to analyze network security performance issues. The servers may communicate to one another via an internal secure storage area network SAN .

Additionally the data center may configure the servers with a hardened operating system OS . Specifically this may include disabling of unnecessary services on the servers renaming the administrator account to a less common name disabling of decoy and guest accounts and preventing remote access to accounts disabling of anonymous FTP to the servers enhanced logging on the servers registry changes on the servers to add security to various parameters and the like.

Referring to a flowchart illustrates an authentication process for authenticating a user via a fingerprint over the Internet according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The process operates on a user s computer equipped with a fingerprint scanning device and a server connected to the user s computer over the Internet. Advantageously the process enables remote authentication of a user over the Internet. The authentication process is initiated step . The authentication process initiates when there is a need to remotely authenticate a user through the server biometrically. Software is provided to the user s computer from the server over the Internet step . Here the server provides software to functionally control the remote capture of the user s fingerprint. This can include ASP code PHP .Net Java or other Internet environments. The software can be provided using VeriSign Code Signing Digital IDs that provide a digital signature to software and macros including Microsoft Authenticode Microsoft Office and VBA Signing Sun Java Signing Adobe Air Netscape Object Signing Macromedia Shockwave and Marimba Castanet Channel Digital IDs for secure delivery over the Internet. Digital IDs are virtual shrinkwrap for your software if your code is tampered with in any way after it is signed the digital signature will break and alert customers that the code is not trustworthy.

Once loaded the software prompts the user to provide a fingerprint scan and the user s fingerprint is scanned at the user s computer through a scanned connected to the computer step . The fingerprint scan results in an image of the user s fingerprint. This image is converted to a numerical value i.e. a long numeric number that uniquely identifies the user step . In some embodiments the conversion is done with a hash index and public and private key encryption. This numerical value is similar to a bar code in a retail store. Also the process does not keep or transmit the fingerprint image. Further it is not possible to reconstruct a fingerprint image from the numerical value. The numerical value is transmitted over the Internet to the server step . This numerical value acts as a public key that is transmitted over the Internet to the server operating as a host server . Once the server receives this numerical value public key the server provides this numerical value to an authentication database of private keys step . If the numerical value matches then the user is authenticated.

Advantageously the process can be utilized with the process to enable remote authentication of a user over the Internet. The registration process is initiated step . The registration process can be done either locally at a user s computer or at a central location where the user is physically present to provide their fingerprint capture step . If the registration process is done locally software is provided to the user s computer from a central server. This software can be downloaded and automatically installed e.g. a Java application. Alternatively the user can go to a central location where someone can physically identify the user e.g. through state issued ID birth certificate etc. and this central location can include a computer with the software. The software interacts with a fingerprint scanner communicatively coupled to the computer.

Once loaded the software prompts the user to provide a fingerprint scan and the user s fingerprint is scanned at the user s computer through a scanned connected to the computer step . The fingerprint scan results in an image of the user s fingerprint. This image is converted to a numerical value i.e. a long numeric number that uniquely identifies the user step . In some embodiments the conversion is done with a hash index and public and private key encryption. A public and private key is stored in an authentication database based on the numerical value step . For example the numerical value can correspond to a public key that will be used in the future to transmit an authentication request to match it to a private key stored in the authentication database.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment diagrams illustrate an exemplary operation of the authentication process from . These diagrams illustrate the steps in the authentication process . First an image capture is performed as shown in the diagram . This image capture may be performed by a fingerprint scanner or the like connected to the user s computer.

Additionally the template may be accessible to any of the users for future use. The user then defines and or selects associated components of the template step . Here the system provides the user the ability to create different formats i.e. placing of information notes files calendars etc. If a pre defined template is selected the user selects the desired template from a list step . Note the list may include various templates including previously created custom templates. For example the present invention may be used in situational awareness for threats. Each new situation may utilize the same template. At this stage the user creating the new cross domain collaboration may adjust rules associated with template components step .

The present invention includes multiple levels of rules handling data in a cross domain collaboration. Rules define who may view edit forward etc. data in the collaboration. For example in the situational awareness scenario the domains may include the FBI the DOD the NSA local law enforcement and private industry. There may be requirements to share some but not all of the information in the situational awareness. For example high level officials in the government may be able to view all of the situational awareness but the private industry may only be needed to see low level or unclassified information. Assume an exemplary situational awareness scenario includes a threat against utility networks and infrastructure. This may require a cross domain collaboration between various governmental agencies and private utility workers. All information may be desired to be shared to those government officials with top secret clearance. However there is a need to have people in the field involved in the collaboration e.g. utility employees. For example the situational awareness may be a cyber threat against utilities. Here there may be a variety of information from top secret e.g. identifying sources of the threats possible outcomes etc. to low level unclassified information e.g. statement concerning possible network issues at utility companies . A private utility collaborator may realize their Internet connectivity is problematic and post such a description on the cross domain collaboration.

After setting the template and the associated rules the user may invite participants and also adjust rules for individual participants step . Note each of the participants is or becomes through the registration process a registered user. Accordingly each user has an associated security level rating etc. When being invited the user setting up the cross domain collaboration may decide to alter individual participants access ability. This may include managing security access in a downward fashion. For example assume the user setting up the collaboration has a secret clearance. The user may adjust other users to lower than secret clearances but may not adjust higher i.e. providing someone with a secret clearance top secret access cannot give more access but may give less . Accordingly the present invention includes three different times when rules are settable for the cross domain collaboration 1 during registration of individual users 2 during template creation and 3 during individual participant invitation. Also invitation to the cross domain collaboration may be via an ePackage as described herein. Finally the users may participate in the cross domain collaboration step and each time information is updated or changed in the template each user may receive a notification e.g. email etc. step .

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a screen shot illustrates an exemplary cross domain collaboration . The cross domain collaboration can be displayed on a computer display or the like for a user to interact with the various systems and methods described herein. The principal purpose of the cross domain collaboration is to share information. All or some of the information posted to the cross domain collaboration may include a security level rating etc. As described above every user of the cross domain collaboration has a certain level rating etc. and this is used to determine whether or not a particular user may view the information. For example assume the user of the cross domain collaboration is rated at a security level Y and X. Here the information above this rating i.e. security level Z may be blacked out or simply unavailable for viewing. Note the user may post information but only information at the security levels Y and X. Information that is posted to the cross domain collaboration may be tagged with an appropriate security level by the user posting the information. Additionally the cross domain collaboration may use code word classification whereby the cross domain collaboration automatically tags an appropriately security level to all posted information based on an analysis of the content keywords etc. Alternatively the information posted may be automatically tagged at the security level of the user posting the information.

The present invention takes groups of users and groups of documents and couples them therebetween. Conventionally there is a one to one correspondence between a user and a document. That is a user is granted permission for access to each document and this permission is typically tied back to the user s password for access. The present invention uses the user s password for authentication access to the system and further uses a user s classification level to determine access to a group of documents. That is access to documents is not based on users but rather on classification level. For example a document may be created or uploaded at a particular classification level and all of the authorized users obtain their access to the document based on this level.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a certified secure and authentic electronic messaging and collaboration system is illustrated. The system includes one or more servers optionally connected to data storage . The servers are connected to networks which may both include the Internet a virtual private network VPN a local area network LAN a wireless network including all types and the like. As described herein the servers are configured to enable a plurality of users to electronically communicate in a secure certified and authenticated manner through the servers . Each of the users may be authenticated through a biometric device that may be configured to implement the various processed described herein e.g. . In an exemplary embodiment each of the users communicates through the networks via an encrypted link that may include any of Advanced Encryption Standard AES Server Gated Cryptography SGC Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS Publication 140 2 from the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the like. In an exemplary embodiment the link may include Extended Validation Secure Sockets Layer SSL SGC Certificate Authorities CA e.g. VeriSign CA . With SGC Server Gated Cryptography a hacker with the time tools and motivation to attack using brute force would require a trillion years to break into a session protected by a SGC enabled certificate. The link may further include AES 256 which enables 256 bit encryption and is much stronger than 128 bit note this requires the user s browser to supports 256 bit encryption . Also the link may include NIST FIPS 140 2 CVMP Validation certificate available . For users connecting with older browsers the system may utilize 128 bit encryption. Certain older browsers and operating systems still cannot may not be able connect at this level and users with the following browser versions and operating systems will temporarily step up to 128 bit SSL encryption 1 Internet Explorer export browser versions from 3.02 but before version 5.5 2 Netscape export browser versions after 4.02 and up through 4.72 and 3 Windows 2000 systems shipped prior to March 2001 that have not downloaded Microsoft s High Encryption Pack or Service Pack 2 and that use Internet Explorer.

In addition to this transmission encryption the servers and the data storage may also include data encryption on stored data utilizing any of AES AES 256 FIPS Publication 140 2 and the like. For Storage Protection the data center housing the servers may be Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70 SAS 70 type 2 compliant with Distributed Denial Of Service attack DDoS protection the firewall and the servers may include a hardened operating system. The servers and the data storage may provide data encryption on the stored data. For example this may include SQL server 08 with Transparent Data Encryption to enable encryption of an entire database data files or log files without the need for application changes. Benefits of this include Search encrypted data using both range and fuzzy searches search secure data from unauthorized users and data encryption without any required changes in existing applications. Additionally each ePackage collaboration etc. may include AES 256 encryption. This may include the Microsoft Cryptographic Application Programming Interface CryptoAPI which is part of the Win32 API the CryptoAPI architecture is somewhat similar to Open Database Connectivity ODBC in that it includes an API layer analogous to ODBC Manager and a number of cryptographic modules underneath that layer that actually perform cryptographic tasks analogous to ODBC drivers and the NIST FIPS 140 2 CVMP Validation certificate available . Further the system may further include a secondary communication mechanism between any of the users . The secondary communication mechanism may include any of email text messaging Interactive Voice Response IVR and the like. The mechanism may be utilized to inform any of the users of an ePackage an update to a collaboration or the like. Of note the mechanism is not meant to convey data but rather to convey that data has been updated or new data is available on the servers .

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a block diagram illustrates functionality of the one or more servers . In this exemplary embodiment the servers include a firewall a web server an alert server and an authentication and data server . Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize this as an exemplary configuration and realize that there may be more or less servers to perform more or less functionality. The firewall is configured to prevent intrusions from the networks to the servers and in an exemplary embodiment the firewall may include a Managed Firewall Cisco ASA 5510SP available from Cisco Systems . The web server communicates to the users through the firewall via the links . The web server further directs the communications from the users between the alert server and the authentication and data server . The alert server is configured to manage alerts related to new and existing ePackages collaborations etc. This includes tracking notification delivery recall and the like. The authentication and data server provides both authentication of the users as well as data storage of the ePackages collaborations etc. In an exemplary embodiment the servers may include Dell PowerEdge Server or equivalent available from Dell operating a variant of Windows Server available from Microsoft .

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a block diagram illustrates a network system utilized in the various exemplary embodiments described herein. The network system includes a data center with three tiers providing access and hosting of ePackages eProjects and the like. Users may exchange ePackages collaborate on eProjects and the like via a network such as the Internet and the data center. For security purposes only the first tier is connected to the Internet . Furthermore user data is only in the third tier which is another tier removed from the Internet. Specifically the first tier may include an eProject server which is communicatively coupled to the users via the Internet . The eProject server may be configured to provide a User Interface to the users and to allow them to interact with the various embodiments described herein. The second tier may include an authentication server an ePackage server and an eProject server each of which is communicatively coupled to the eProject server . The authentication server is configured to store data related to the users for secure authentication such as described herein in . The ePackage server is configured to create modify etc. ePackages between the various users . The eProject server is configured to create modify etc. eProjects collaborated on by the various users . The third tier includes a data server and a video and audio server that are each communicatively coupled to the ePackage server and the eProject server . Of note the servers contain secure confidential user data in the form of ePackages eProjects and the like and these are only connected to the Internet via the tiers providing an extra layer of security.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a method illustrates a process for digitally signing files emails etc. in an ePackage . Conventionally authenticated signatures require a recipient of the ePackage to print out the file manually sign printed papers and scanning the signed printed papers. Obviously such a conventional process is inefficient when viewed in context of the systems and methods described herein. Other convention mechanisms include using a so called electronic signature using text characters such as s etc. However these mechanisms do not provide verification of the actual signature or may be hacked via software tools. The method provides a secured verified process for digitally signing documents files emails etc. within the systems and methods of the present invention. The method is configured to operate while a user is logged in or following the user logging into the servers step and the method may be used anytime the user wishes to digitally or electronically sign a document email file ePackage etc. step .

The method utilizes a digital key step and if the user does not have a digital key the method enables the user to obtain such a key via an external digital rights manager step . Here the user may be redirected while being logged into the server to an external provider e.g. using secure SSL links to register and obtain the digital key. The external provider is configured to authenticate the user and provide a digital key along with an associated password to the user. In an exemplary embodiment the password may require biometric authentication along with entry of the password. In another exemplary embodiment the password may simply include the biometric authentication. Note the digital key may be maintained locally at the servers and not with the user s machine. If the user has a digital key step then the user may sign any document file etc. using the digital key step . In an exemplary embodiment the systems and methods described herein may include a GUI button to digitally sign any document file etc. used in the system.

Referring to in an exemplary embodiment a screen shot illustrates viewing management for files in an exemplary ePackage. Specifically for security and confidentiality the present invention contemplates rules that may be enforced on files text documents etc. associated with an ePackage or on the entire ePackage . These rules are enforced by the system and limit a recipients ability to perform various tasks with the files. For example the rules may include a full permission whereby the recipient can do anything with the files i.e. read save forward print view etc. Also the rules may include a reply forward prevention rule whereby the recipient is prevented from replying or forwarding the files. The rules may also include a view read only whereby the recipient is only able to view the files on through the servers i.e. the recipient is prevented from saving a local copy. The rules may also include a print allowed rule determinative of whether the recipient can print the files. Additionally the rules may include a screen capture prevention rule where the servers are configured to prevent the recipient from using locally installed print screen functionality e.g. CTRL ALT PRINT SCREEN in Windows the Sniping Tool in Windows 7 etc. . Finally the rules may include a screen mask to prevent external devices e.g. camera phones etc. from taking pictures of a screen with the files being viewed. This may be accomplished by requiring the recipient to view the files using the cursor to selectively show a portion of text at a time. Alternatively this may be accomplished via watermarking on the screen. Note the present invention contemplates use of one or more rules in conjunction with each other.

Although the present invention has been illustrated and described herein with reference to preferred embodiments and specific examples thereof it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other embodiments and examples may perform similar functions and or achieve like results. All such equivalent embodiments and examples are within the spirit and scope of the present invention and are intended to be covered by the following claims.
