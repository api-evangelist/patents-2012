The current application also claims a foreign priority to the application of Taiwan No. 096135034 filed Sep. 20 2007.

The invention relates to a method for displaying a computer video on another display screen and more particularly to a display method that can locate a specific video region of a computer screen forward the same and display the same on another screen.

Nowadays network sources have become one of major providers of knowledge and entertainment. Tremendous amount of image data can be immediately available through network download. Further share information can be also quickly posted to a website through the networking.

For most of applications in multimedia display over the network the computer is the inevitable tool to share the network information. To those unfamiliar with the computer operation or to those uncomfortable to entertain the network video files through a computer screen or monitor the network resources would be much attractive if the network media can be directly displayed on another screen other than the tiny computer screen such as a TV screen in the living room.

Please refer to a typical framework is shown to demonstrate how a computer video can be displayed in another screen. The framework includes a computer a displayer and a display or screen .

The computer capable of networking and multimedia playing can display streaming media through some video sharing websites such as YouTube or can display video files pre stored in a hard disk or a disc player of the computer . No matter what kind of aforesaid displaying is performed the computer need to install a specific display program. In particular some formats of video files can only be played through specific display programs. Hence to have the computer able to display versatile multimedia files various display programs need to be installed inside the computer .

The displayer can be cabled or connected wirelessly to the computer so as to establish a local internet . Through the internet the displayer can receive multimedia streams from the computer and further forward the received multimedia streams to the display an LCD TV for example for broadcasting. In the case that the computer can compress and encode the streams then the displayer should have respective functions in uncompressing and decoding so that the multimedia streams received from the computer can be displayed in the display . Further the displayer can include a remote control and an accompanying wireless receiver . The wireless receiver built in the displayer is used to receive commands from the remote control . These commands include that to have the displayer to capture specific multimedia streams in the computer that to output the multimedia streams to the display for broadcasting and so on.

Generally a video sharing website uses to provide a tiny video region to occupy portion of the computer screen and leaves the rest of the computer screen for commercial purposes. Yet to the user it is favorite to have the video region to be enlarged to occupy the whole area of the computer screen and to have the commercial area to be zoomed as small as possible. In particular it is hoped that the display can only show the enlarged video from the video region and expel all the commercial materials in the commercial area . However by the current application such a wish is almost infeasible and thus the introducing of the internet and the computer to the living room is less popular.

Also in the art for a remote control able to control a distant computer it should be equipped with sufficient hardware and software to achieve functions in replacing the keyboard and the mouse. Thus the design in such a remote control would be inevitably complicated. Furthermore in the case that the computer screen and the video region present different features in controls the operation of the remote control would become ragged especially when it is operated far away from the computer . It is clear that the conventional remote control is less suitable for a user who is close to the display but away from the computer .

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen by which a tiny video region on the computer screen can be forwarded and enlarged to a distant display for broadcasting.

In a first embodiment of the present invention the locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen comprises the steps of capturing a plurality of computer screens Si where is an integral in a time sequence during a predetermined time period T comparing the computer screen Si and the following computer screen Si 1 so as to locate a plurality of screen differences Di in between in which every single screen difference Di includes at least a different region Ri locating a target screen difference Dm from the group of Di s in which the different region Ri of Dm covers each respective Ri of each Di locating a largest in area different region Rv among plural Ri s of the Dm and defining the Rv as a video region capturing a film of the video region forwarding the film to a distant displayer and the displayer broadcasting the film on the display.

In a second embodiment of the present invention the locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen comprises the steps of capturing a plurality of computer screens Si where is an integral in a time sequence during a predetermined time period T comparing the computer screen Si and the following computer screen Si 1 so as to locate a plurality of screen differences Di in between in which every single screen difference Di includes at least a different region Ri judging a position of every different region Ri of each screen difference Di so as to locate an object window Wi with respect to each single Ri determining one of the Wi s as a video region Rv by comparing sizes and appearance times of the Wi s capturing a film of the video region forwarding the film to a distant displayer and the displayer broadcasting the film on the display.

In the present invention for the locating and displaying method does only capture the video region of the computer screen and display the video streams of the video region on a distant display through the displayer only the video streams of the video region can be shown on the distant display and all other images on the computer screen other than the target video region such as the commercial materials wouldn t be shown on the display such that the interested video streams can be present on the display by a full screen scale.

All these objects are achieved by the locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen described below.

The invention disclosed herein is directed to a locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen. In the following description numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that variations of these specific details are possible while still achieving the results of the present invention. In other instance well known components are not described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.

Referring now to a schematic view of a framework that performs a locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen in accordance with the present invention is shown. One of major features of the present invention is that a video region detection module is built inside the computer . The video region detection module can tell the video region from the commercial area in the computer screen can capture video streams of the video region can performing encoding and compressing upon the video streams and can forward the video streams to the distant displayer for further playing the video streams on the display for example a TV set in the living room . In the display of the display only the video streams in the video region of the computer screen can be shown.

In the present invention the connection between the displayer and the computer can be a cable form or a wireless form through an internet . The video region detection module can be stored inside the displayer in advance and can be uploaded to the computer as soon as the connection between the displayer and the computer is established. In general the displayer located usually adjacent to the display can further include a remote control and a wireless receiver . The remote control is to issue commands to the wireless receiver . The displayer can activate the video region detection module inside the computer to perform necessary detecting and broadcasting jobs.

Referring now to a flowchart of a first embodiment of the locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen in accordance with the present invention is shown. The locating and displaying method of the present invention comprises the following steps.

Step 1. Capture or sample a plurality of computer screens Si where i is an integral in a time sequence during a predetermined time period T . For example sample 10 i.e. i 1 10 computer screens in a second.

Step 2. Compare the current computer screen Si and the following computer screen Si 1 so as to locate a plurality of screen differences Di in between. Referring to each of the screen differences Di s includes at least a different region Ri. That is to say to the preceding example a total number of 9 screen differences Di s i 1 9 can be generated. In the present invention the different region is defined to be the smallest square area on each difference district of the respective screen difference. Therefore the number of the screen differences may be zero namely no difference between two computer screens or more than one namely plural difference in between .

Step 3. Locate a target screen difference Dm from the group of Di s say from D D in which the different region Ri of Dm covers each respective Ri of each Di. Referring to the purpose of this current step is to locate the screen difference i.e. the target screen difference Dm that can cover all the different regions Ri s.

Step 4. Define the largest in area different region among the plural Ri s of the Dm as the video region Rv. Generally in a computer screen for the area for the video region is larger than that for the commercial area it can be taken for granted that the largest different region among all Ri s is the video region Rv. In the contents in the video region Rv present the video streams the user want to see.

Step 5. Capture video streams or say a film of the video region for example upon a section of films. In capturing the streams a plurality of screens in the video region can be captured during a predetermined time period. For example a rate of 24 captures per second can be adopted in capturing the video streams. Those captured video streams can be encoded and further compressed into streams with a specific format. For example the mp4 format can be one of the acceptable formats.

Step 6. Form a streaming server inside the computer to broadcast a broadcasting message to the displayer in which the broadcasting message includes the URL of the computer.

Step 7. Establish a connection between the displayer and the streaming server of the computer according to the URL of the broadcasting message.

Step 8. The streaming server forwards the compressed streams to the displayer and then the displayer decodes and uncompresses the compressed streams into the respective uncompressed video streams.

Referring now to a flowchart of a second embodiment of the locating and displaying method upon a specific video region of a computer screen in accordance with the present invention is shown. The locating and displaying method of the present invention comprises the following steps.

Step 1. Capture or sample a plurality of computer screens Si where i is an integral in a time sequence during a predetermined time period T . For example sample 10 i.e. i 1 10 computer screens in a second.

Step 2. Compare the current computer screen Si and the following computer screen Si 1 so as to locate a plurality of screen differences Di in between. Referring to each of the screen differences Di s includes at least a different region Ri. That is to say to the preceding example a total number of 9 screen differences Di s i 1 9 can be generated. In the present invention the different region is defined to be the smallest square area on each difference district of the respective screen difference. Therefore the number of the screen differences may be zero namely no difference between two computer screens or more than one namely plural difference in between .

Step 3. Judge a respective position of every different region Ri of each the screen difference Di so as to locate an object window Wi with respect to each single Ri. In positioning the Wi referring to the center point Pi of the respective Ri is firstly computed then an appropriate API for example the WindowFromPoint provided by the OS for example the MS Windows system of the computer is used to obtain an object window handle including the Pi and finally another API for example the GetWindowRect of the computer is used to locate the Wi including the Pi.

Step 4. Determine one of the Wi s as a video region Rv by comparing sizes or appearance times of the individual Wi s. For each of the Wi s can be the video region Rv or a non video region for example a commercial area or the like and for the video region usually has a broader area and a larger number in the appearance time of the different region so it is practical to determine the video region Rv by judging the size and the appearance time of each of the object windows Wi s. In the present invention a specific object window Wi is determined to be the video region Rv by having the largest number in the result of the area timing the appearance time.

Step 5. Capture video streams or say a film of the video region for example upon a section of films. In capturing the streams a plurality of screens in the video region can be captured during a predetermined time period. For example a rate of 24 captures per second can be adopted in capturing the video streams. Those captured video streams can be encoded and further compressed into streams with a specific format. For example the mp4 format can be one of the acceptable formats.

Step 6. Form a streaming server inside the computer to broadcast a broadcasting message to the displayer in which the broadcasting message includes the URL of the computer.

Step 7. Establish a connection between the displayer and the streaming server of the computer according to the URL of the broadcasting message.

Step 8. The streaming server forwards the compressed streams to the displayer and then the displayer decodes and uncompresses the compressed streams into the respective uncompressed video streams.

From the aforesaid description the present invention is superior to the relevant prior art for the following reasons.

a. The present invention can directly locate the video region of the computer screen capture the video region and encode the video streams of the video region by a relevant format. Namely no matter what the format of the video streams or the application program to play these video streams in the video region is the present invention can still perform the aforesaid locating capturing editing and replaying the video streams in the video region.

b. By providing the present invention any processing level of the CPU of the computer can still appropriately encode a predetermined length of the film in the video region of the computer screen and thus no screen flickering or stalling can happen any more.

c. For only the video region of the computer screen can be shown in the display by providing the present invention the video region can be replayed in the display in any acceptable zoom such that a preferred screen size to amuse the video streams of the video region can be obtained.

d. In the present invention the remote control can control the displayer in a more direct and simple way just like a normal TV remote to duplicate the playing of the video streams in the video region to the display.
