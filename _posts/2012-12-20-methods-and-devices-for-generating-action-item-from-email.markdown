The present application relates to electronic messages and more particularly to methods and electronic devices for automatically generating an action item based on an electronic message such as an email.

A personal information manager PIM is an application that functions as an organizer of information for a user. Personal information managers often organize addresses personal notes and journal entries tasks reminders archived email messages etc.

Personal information managers often allow a user to create tasks. Tasks may for example be to do items. That is a task may be a record of an action that a user wishes to perform or complete. Tasks may be manually input into the personal information manager by a user. For example a user may use a keyboard to manually compose the task. Some personal information managers may allow the task to be associated with a date and a reminder of the task to be generated based on the date. Tasks may be presented in a list which may be referred to as a to do list which may include other tasks.

Personal information managers may provide a very limited set of management functions and may rely heavily on user input for task creation. There is a need for improved personal information managers.

In one example embodiment the present application describes a processor implemented method. The method includes receiving an email message via a communication subsystem determining that the received email message includes a follow up flag that indicates that an action is required regarding the email message and in response to determining that the received email message includes a follow up flag that indicates that an action is required regarding the email message creating an action item based on the received email message.

A smartphone is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capabilities than a basic non smartphone cellular phone. For example a smartphone may have an ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.

A tablet computer which may also be referred to as a tablet is an electronic device which is generally larger than a mobile phone such as a smartphone or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized. That is mobile phones or personal digital assistants are generally small enough to be carried by a person easily often in a shirt or pant pocket while tablet computers are larger and may not fit within pant pockets. For example many tablet computers have a height which is seven inches 7 or more. In some example embodiments the tablet computer may be a slate computer. A slate computer is a tablet computer which does not include a dedicated keyboard. A slate computer may allow for text input through the use of a virtual keyboard or an external keyboard which connects to the slate computer via a wired or wireless connection.

The electronic device includes a housing not shown which houses components of the electronic device . The internal components of the electronic device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The electronic device includes a controller including at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the electronic device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including one or more input interfaces such as a keyboard one or more control buttons one or more microphones and or a touch sensitive overlay associated with a touchscreen display flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems a data port which may be a serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port one or more output interfaces such as a display one or more speakers or other output interfaces a short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The electronic device may include a touch sensitive display which may be referred to as a touchscreen or a touchscreen display . The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller.

The electronic device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The electronic device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

In some example embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may include an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The electronic device may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network. The auxiliary I O subsystems may include a pointing or navigational tool input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

The electronic device may store data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments the data may include service data having information required by the electronic device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the electronic device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases or data stores each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the memory of the electronic device .

The data may include one or more email messages . The email messages are a form of content . The email messages may in at least some embodiments include received email messages i.e. email messages received at the electronic device but not composed on the electronic device and sent email messages i.e. email messages sent from an account associated with the electronic device . One or more of the email messages may include an action required indicator such as a follow up indicator. The action required indicator may for example be a flag that may be set for the email message to indicate that the email message requires an action. More particularly the action required indicator may be a specific property or field associated with an email message that is configured to indicate that an email message requires an action to be completed. That is the action required indicator may be a reserved field or property associated with the email message. This reserved field or property is separate and distinct from the message body or subject fields.

In at least some embodiments the action required indicator may be set to identify the nature of the action required. For example in at least some embodiments the action required indicator may be set to follow up review forward reply call or other states indicating other actions not specifically recited herein. The action required indicator may be set by a message sender or a message recipient to indicate to a sender or a recipient that an action is required regarding the email message.

In at least some embodiments the action required indicator of an email message may include timing information. The timing information associated with the email message may specify a date or period of time when the action associated with the email message is to be completed or when a reminder should be generated based on the action item. By way of example the timing information may include a due date associated with the email and or a reminder date associated with an email a date and or time that will be used by the electronic device for triggering a reminder .

In at least some embodiments the email message may permit the action required indicator such as the follow up indicator or another indicator associated with the email message such an indicator may be referred to as a completion indicator to be set to a completed state when the action is completed. In at least some embodiments a graphical user interface may be provided by a messaging application or another application that allows a user to set the action required indicator to the completed state. For example the email message may be displayed together with an interface element such as a check box which a user may activate to set the action required indicator to the completed state.

The data may include one or more action items . An action item may be a record of an action that a user wishes to be reminded of. That is the action item may be a record of a future action i.e. an action that a user intends to perform in the future . More particularly the action item serves as a record for a user to remind the user that an action is required. Action items may also be referred to as tasks.

In at least some embodiments the action item may include context information. Context information is information which is associated with the action item . More particularly the context information may provide context for the action item . The context information may explain the circumstances which caused the creation of the action item and or a requirement associated with the completion of the action item.

For example in at least some embodiments the action item may specify timing information associated with the action item . Such timing information may specify a date or time period during which the action item is to be completed. In some embodiments the timing information may specify a date or period of time when the action item is to be completed or when a reminder should be generated based on the action item. The timing information may however be specified in a less precise manner for example the timing information may be specified using imprecise terms such as soon or someday . In at least some embodiments software may associate each of these imprecise terms with a defined time period for the purposes of generating reminders. For example soon may generate a reminder a week after creation of the action item while someday may generate a reminder a month after creation of the action item.

The timing information for an action item may act as reminder condition for the action item . That is reminders may be generated based on the timing information.

The action items may also include content and or be associated with such content . For example an action item may in at least some embodiments link to one or more items of content or may include one or more items of content e.g. the content may be embedding within the action item and or may be stored elsewhere in which case the action item may simply link to the content . The content may in at least some embodiments be content that is stored on the electronic device . Content which is stored locally in memory of the electronic device may be referred to as stored content. In some embodiments the content may be stored remotely e.g. on a web server .

In some embodiments and for some types of content the action item may not include the content itself. Rather the action item may include a link or reference to the content . This link or reference allows the content to be accessed when accessing the action item .

The content may for example include any one or combination of the following text a video such as for example an MPEG video WMV video AVI video etc. an audio file such as for example an MP3 audio file a WAV audio file a RealAudio audio file etc. an email message a word processor file such as a Microsoft Word file etc. a spreadsheet such as a Microsoft Excel file an electronic book such as an e book in an EPUB MOBI or other file format a presentation such as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation a Portable Document Format PDF document an image file such as a raster vector or 3D graphic image including for example a JPEG file TIFF file etc. . Other types of content apart from those types listed above may also be stored in memory of the electronic device .

Content that is associated with an action item may be content that may be useful in completing the action associated with the action item . For example the content may be something that a user may wish to review access and or consult in order to complete the action item .

In at least some embodiments an action item may be associated with multiple items of content . For example the action item may link to or include a first item of content such as text and may also link to or include a second item of content such as a video .

As will be described in greater detail below in at least some embodiments the action item may include or be associated with an email message . That is the action item may include content or may link to content that is an email message .

In at least some embodiments action items may have a completion indicator and or progress indicator associated therewith. A completion indicator may be a flag that may be set to complete or incomplete to indicate whether the action associated with an action item has been completed. In some embodiments the completion indicator may have two possible values a first value represents a complete state and a second value represents an incomplete state. A progress indicator may allow greater precision in describing a status of an action item . For example a progress indicator may specify the degree to which the action has been completed e.g. it may be specified as a percentage such as 50 . In some embodiments the progress indicator may allow a text based status to be set to indicate the level of completion of the action associated with an action item . By way of example the progress indicator may be set to not started in progress waiting for feedback or done. 

The data port may be used for synchronization with a user s host computer system not shown . The data port enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device through a direct reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.

In some example embodiments the electronic device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the electronic device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

The electronic device also includes or is connectable to a power source such as a battery coupled to the electronic device via a battery interface . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the electronic device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the electronic device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the short range communication subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A pre determined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the electronic device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to an operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the electronic device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable device subsystems . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime.

In some example embodiments the electronic device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or a web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the touchscreen display . A user of the electronic device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices such as the touchscreen display . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the electronic device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar to the data communication mode except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. a voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the touchscreen display may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules include operating system software and software applications such as an email application and or an action item application .

The email application is configured for providing functions associated with email messages . For example the email application may allow email messages to be composed displayed forwarded received replied to and or sent. The email application may provide other functions instead of or in addition to any one or more of these functions.

By way of example as noted above in at least some embodiments email messages may include an action required indicator. In at least some embodiments the action item indicator may be set by a message sender. In at least some such embodiments the email application may be configured to allow a user to set and or change the status of the action item indicator. For example a received email message may indicate that an action is required regarding the email message e.g. it may indicate that a user should follow up . A graphical user interface provided by the email application may then allow a user to change the state of the action item indicator for example to set it to a completed state. Thus the email application may provide functions for managing the action item indicator associated with an email message .

As will be described in greater detail below in at least some embodiments the action item application is configured to create and manage action items . For example in at least some embodiments the action item application may provide a user interface that allows action items to be manually created. For example the user interface may allow a user to input information that is to be associated with the action item .

As will be described below with reference to in at least some embodiments the action item application is configured to automatically create an action item based on a received email message if that email message satisfies one or more predetermined criterion. For example in at least some embodiments the action item application may automatically create an action item based on a received email message if an action item indicator associated with that received email message is set to a state which indicates that an action is required regarding the email message.

In some embodiments a sender of an email message may have set the state of the action item indicator. For example a sender of an email message may set the state of the action item indicator to a state that indicates that an action is required regarding the email message. Accordingly when the email message is received it may already indicate that an action is required. The action item application may determine whether the sender of a received email message has set the action item indicator to a state that indicates that an action is required regarding the email message and if so may automatically create an action item based on the received email message. Thus in at least some embodiments a sender of an email message received at the electronic device may effectively create an action item on the electronic device .

As will be described in greater detail below with reference to in at least some embodiments the action item application may be configured to operate in an operating mode where it displays one or more display screens based on the action items stored on the electronic device . For example as will be described in greater detail with in some embodiments the electronic device may display a display screen that lists a plurality of action items . This list which may be referred to as a to do list or a task list may include both action items that were automatically created based on an email message e.g. according to the method of and may also include action items created in other ways. For example the list may also include action items created manually.

As will be described in greater detail below with reference to in some embodiments the electronic device may display a display screen that allows a user to view an action item in greater detail. For example the display screen may allow a user to view or access content associated with the action item such as an email message .

In at least some embodiments the action item application is configured to trigger reminders e.g. to generate an audible visual or vibratory alert for action items for example using timing information associated with the action items .

In at least some embodiments the action item application or another application may include a sharing framework which allows action items to be created from within other applications. The sharing framework may for example include an application programming interface API which allows other applications to access features or functions of the action item application . By way of example the sharing framework may allow another application to create an action item based on content associated with the other application. For example in at least some embodiments the email application may create an action item based on an email message received at the electronic device if certain predetermined criterion is satisfied.

In at least some example embodiments the operating system may perform some or all of the functions of the action item application and or the email application . In other example embodiments the functions or a portion of the functions of the action item application and or the email application may be performed by one or more other applications. Further while the action item application and the email application have each been illustrated as a single block these applications may include a plurality of software modules. In at least some example embodiments these software modules may be divided among multiple applications.

The electronic device may include a range of additional software applications including for example a notepad application a word processing application an image viewing and or editing application a calendar application an address book application a mapping application or a media player application such as a video player and or an audio player or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the touchscreen display according to the application. In at least some example embodiments the software applications may include pre determined gesture information defining functionalities associated with the pre determined gestures received via the touchscreen display . For example a software application may determine a finger swiping movement i.e. a pre determined gesture on the touchscreen display as a scrolling function.

The software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

The following discussion will refer to example methods for creating action items . Reference will be made to various example display screens to facilitate understanding of the example methods. The methods may in at least some embodiments be performed by the action item application and or the email application . More particularly the action item application and or the email application and or another application may contain computer readable instructions which when executed cause the processor of the electronic device to perform the methods described below. The computer readable instructions may be configured to cause the processor to generate one or more screens having the features described below.

Referring now to an example method for creating an action item is illustrated. Features of the method will be discussed with reference to the example screens of .

At an email message is received at the electronic device . The email message may for example be received via the wireless communication subsystem or via another communication subsystem or interface. The email message may be received by the email application . The email application may be configured to manage the received email message . More particularly the received email message may be stored and or displayed by the email application .

At an application associated with the electronic device may determine whether the email message satisfies one or more predetermined criterion. In at least some embodiments the action item application may perform . More particularly the action item application may examine the email message and may determine whether the email message satisfies the one or more predetermined criterion. In other embodiments the email application may perform . That is the email application may examine the email message and may determine whether the email message satisfies the predetermined criterion. In other embodiments other applications such as third party applications may perform .

In at least some embodiments the predetermined criterion requires that an action required indicator associated with the received email message indicates that an action is required regarding the email message. As noted in the discussion of the action required indicator may for example be a flag that may be set for the email message to indicate that the email message requires an action. In at least some embodiments the action required indicator may be set to identify the nature of the action required. For example in at least some embodiments the action required indicator may be set to follow up review forward reply call or other states indicating other actions not specifically recited herein. The action required indicator may be set by a message sender or a message recipient to indicate to a sender or a recipient that an action is required regarding the email message.

Accordingly in at least some embodiments the electronic device may determine whether the received email message includes an action item indicator that indicates that an action is required regarding the email message. For example the action required indicator may be a follow up flag indicating that the user of the electronic device is required to follow up regarding the email message.

In some embodiments the action item indicator may be set by a message sender of the email message . In at least some such embodiments the electronic device may determine whether the received email message includes an action item indicator that was set by a sender of the email message and that indicates that an action is required regarding the email message.

If at the electronic device determines that the email message satisfies the predetermined criterion e.g. if it determines that based on the action item indicator an action is required regarding the email message then at the electronic device creates an action item based on the received email message .

The creation of the action item may be performed by the email application the action item application or both. For example in some embodiments these applications or other applications may work cooperatively to create an action item . In some embodiments the email application may engage a sharing framework associated with the action item application such as an API.

Thus in at least some embodiments in response to determining that the received email message satisfies the predetermined criterion an action item is created based on the received email message. As noted previously in some embodiments the predetermined criterion requires that an action required indicator associated with the email message be set to a state that indicates that an action is required regarding the email message. In such embodiments when an action is required for an email message an action item is automatically created based on that email message.

When an action item is created at a new record which may be referred to as an action item record may be created and stored in memory of the electronic device. This action item record may be stored in an action item database that is reserved for storing action items. The action item database may store action items irrespective of the manner by which they were created. For example action items that are created manually e.g. via user input may be stored together with action items that are created automatically e.g. based on an email that requires an action .

The created action item may include content extracted from the email message and or may include a link to the email message. As will be illustrated in the link may allow a user to open the email message in the email application when a user accesses the action item. The use of a link may reduce storage requirements since the content contained in the email is not stored separately with the email and the action item. In some embodiments even when the content is included in the action item by way of a link when the action item is opened and displayed the content may be displayed as embedded content. That is when the action item is accessed content from an email message that is linked with that action item may automatically be displayed.

When the action item is created based on the email message a completion indicator associated with the action item may automatically be set to a state that indicates that the action associated with the action item has not been completed.

In at least some embodiments when the action item is automatically created at timing information associated with that action item may automatically be generated. In some embodiments such timing information may be generated based on the email message. For example in at least some embodiments the action required indicator of an email message may include timing information. The timing information associated with the email message may specify a date or period of time when the action associated with the email message is to be completed or when a reminder should be generated based on the action item. By way of example the timing information may include a due date associated with the email and or a reminder date associated with an email a date and or time that will be used by the electronic device for triggering a reminder . In at least some such embodiments timing information for the action item may be generated based on the timing information specified by the action required indicator.

In some embodiments the electronic device may parse the contents of the email message to attempt to identify a word or phrase that may indicate timing information. For example the electronic device may search for a phrase such as get back to me by and may look for timing information such as a date following the identified phrase. That timing information may be used to generate timing information for the action item .

In some embodiments the electronic device may automatically generate timing information for the action item based predetermined default timing information. For example in one embodiment the default timing information for an action item generated based on an email message may be one week.

As noted in the discussion of in at least some embodiments action items may have a completion indicator and or progress indicator associated therewith. In some such embodiments at the completion indicator for the action item may be set to indicate that the action item has not been completed and or to indicate that no progress has yet been made towards the completion of the action.

After the action item has been created one or more actions may be performed involving the created action item .

For example the action item may be displayed. For example in some embodiments at a display screen may display the action item created at based on the email message together with other action items such as one or more manually created action items . An example of one such display screen will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .

In at least some embodiments after an action item is created based on an email message a user may be permitted to add other content to the action item.

For example at an instruction may be received at the electronic device via an input interface instructing the electronic device to add content to the created action item i.e. to the action item created at . Such an instruction may for example be received via a suitable interface element provided on a display screen such as the display screen of which will be discussed in greater detail below .

The instruction may specify the content that is to be added to the action item . The content may be content that is stored on the electronic device or content that is stored remotely. The content may for example include any one or combination of the following text a video such as for example an MPEG video WMV video AVI video etc. an audio file such as for example an MP3 audio file a WAV audio file a RealAudio audio file etc. an email message a word processor file such as a Microsoft Word file etc. a spreadsheet such as a Microsoft Excel file an electronic book such as an e book in an EPUB MOBI or other file format a presentation such as a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation a Portable Document Format PDF document an image file such as a raster vector or 3D graphic image including for example a JPEG file TIFF file etc. . Other types of content apart from those types listed above may also be stored in memory of the electronic device .

In response to receiving the instruction to add the content to the action item the electronic device adds the content to the action item at . For example an action item may in at least some embodiments be updated to link to the content or may be updated to include the content e.g. the content may be embedding within the action item and or may be stored elsewhere in which case the action item may simply link to the content .

In at least some embodiments when the action item is created based on the email message a bond is created between the action item and the email message . An operation or action performed on the email message may affect the action item and or an operation or action performed on the action item may affect the email message . For example content that is added to the action item e.g. at may be accessible when viewing the email message. For example when viewing an email message associated with an action item to which additional content has been added a link to the additional content may be provided.

For example in at least some embodiments after an action item is created based on an email message at the electronic device may monitor operations associated with the email message and may determine whether a predetermined event which may be an operation of a predetermined type associated with the email message has occurred.

If the electronic device determines that such a predetermined event has occurred then at the electronic device may perform a predetermined action associated with the action item.

For example in some embodiments at the electronic device may monitor a completion indicator associated with the email message to determine whether the completion indicator has been set to a state that indicates that an action associated with the email message has been completed this state may for example be set via user input received through the email application . If the electronic device determines that the completion indicator has been set to the state that indicates that the action has been completed then at the electronic device may automatically set a completion indicator associated with the action item to a state that indicates that the action associated with the action item has been completed this state may be referred to as a completed state . Thus in at least some embodiments a change to the completion indicator associated with an email message may cause a corresponding change to the completion indicator associated with an action item created based on that email message.

By way of further example in some embodiments at the electronic device may determine whether the email message has been replied to. That is the electronic device may determine whether the user has responded to the email message by sending an outgoing message to the sender of the received message. If the electronic device determines that a reply has been sent to the email message then at the electronic device may generate a prompt allowing a user to set a completion indicator associated with the action item associated with that email message to a completed state. That is the electronic device may determine that since the received email message that caused the action item to be created has been replied to the completion indicator for that action item may need to be updated. In at least some embodiments before updating the completion indicator the electronic device generates a prompt to allow a user to confirm that the completion indicator is to be updated.

In some embodiments the electronic device may monitor activity associated with the action item and may update the email message based on such activity. For example at the electronic device may monitor to determine whether a predetermined event associated with the action item has occurred. If so then at the electronic device may perform a predetermined action associated with the email message. For example in some embodiments at the electronic device may determine whether a completion indicator associated with the action item has been set to a completed state. If the electronic device determines that the completion indicator associated with the action item has been set to a completed state then the electronic device may at set a completion indicator associated with the email message that caused that action item to be created to a completed state. Thus in at least some embodiments a change to the completion indicator associated with an action item created based on an email message may cause a corresponding change to the completion indicator associated with that email message.

Referring now to an example display screen is illustrated. The example display screen may be displayed at of . The example display screen includes an action item created based on an email message. This action item is displayed in a list that also includes other action items created in other ways. For example these other action items may be created manually e.g. via direct user input . The action items are displayed in an order that is not determined by the manner of creation. In the example illustrated the list is ordered such that action items are ordered according to the urgency of those action items i.e. according to timing information associated with the action items .

The list includes a completion indicator interface element for each displayed action item the completion indicator interface element associated with the third action item is obscured by a hand . The completion indicator interface element is a graphical user interface element that may be used for setting a completion indicator associated with the action item 

The displayed action items may be selectable. For example a touchscreen display may be used to allow a hand or another object to select an action item. Selection of an action item may cause an action item to be opened. More specifically selection of an action item may cause a further display screen to be displayed.

Referring now to an example of the further display screen is illustrated. The display screen may be provided by the action item application . The display screen is displayed when an action item associated with an email message is opened. The display screen displays the action item . More particularly the display screen includes the email message or a portion thereof .

As noted previously in the discussion of and of in some embodiments other content in addition to the email message may be added to action item . In the example illustrated the display screen identifies other content that has been added to the action item . In the illustrated example the display screen identifies two items of content that were previously added to complement the email message an article clipped from the web entitled Toronto in June and a video entitled Best Toronto sights .

The display screen includes an interface element that allows a user to add content to the action item. The interface element is selectable via an input interface such as a touchscreen display . Activation of the interface element may cause a further display screen not shown to be provided which allows a user to browse for content that is to be added to the action item .

Other methods may be used to allow content to be added to an action item that was created based on an email message. For example as noted previously in at least some embodiments the action item application may include a sharing framework such as an API that allows other applications to access features of the action item application . The sharing framework may allow other applications that are accessing content to add that content to the action item . For example when a web browser is active a user may be permitted to clip an active web page directly to the action item . The web browser may activate the sharing framework to update the action item .

The display screen also includes a selectable option to open the email message associated with the action item . Activation of the selectable option may cause the email message that caused the action item to be created to be opened in an email application .

Similarly in some embodiments a display screen may include a selectable option to reply to the email message associated with the action item. That is when the action item is accessed a selectable option to reply to the email message may also be provided. Activation of the selectable option to reply to the email message associated with the action item may cause a message composition user interface to be displayed within the email application . A recipient messaging address may be automatically populated with the address of the message that sent the email message which is being replied to.
