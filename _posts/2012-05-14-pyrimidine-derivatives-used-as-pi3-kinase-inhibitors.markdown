The present invention relates to new phosphatidylinositol PI 3 kinase inhibitor compounds their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof compositions of the new compounds either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and uses of the new compounds either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent in the prophylaxis or treatment of a number of diseases in particular those characterized by the abnormal activity of growth factors receptor tyrosine kinases protein serine threonine kinases G protein coupled receptors and phospholipid kinases and phosphatases.

Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases PI3Ks comprise a family of lipid and serine threonine kinases that catalyze the transfer of phosphate to the D 3 position of inositol lipids to produce phosphoinositol 3 phosphate PIP phosphoinositol 3 4 diphosphate PIP and phosphoinositol 3 4 5 triphosphate PIP that in turn act as second messengers in signaling cascades by docking proteins containing pleckstrin homology FYVE Phox and other phospholipid binding domains into a variety of signaling complexes often at the plasma membrane Vanhaesebroeck et al. 70 535 2001 Katso et al. 17 615 2001 . Of the two Class 1 PI3Ks Class 1A PI3Ks are heterodimers composed of a catalytic p110 subunit isoforms constitutively associated with a regulatory subunit that can be p85 p55 p50 p85 or p55 . The Class 1B sub class has one family member a heterodimer composed of a catalytic p110 subunit associated with one of two regulatory subunits p101 or p84 Fruman et al. 67 481 1998 Suire et al. 15 566 2005 . The modular domains of the p85 55 50 subunits include Src Homology SH2 domains that bind phosphotyrosine residues in a specific sequence context on activated receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases resulting in activation and localization of Class 1A PI3Ks. Class 1B PI3K is activated directly by G protein coupled receptors that bind a diverse repertoire of peptide and non peptide ligands Stephens et al. 89 105 1997 Katso et al. 17 615 675 2001 . Consequently the resultant phospholipid products of class I PI3K link upstream receptors with downstream cellular activities including proliferation survival chemotaxis cellular trafficking motility metabolism inflammatory and allergic responses transcription and translation Cantley et al. 64 281 1991 Escobedo and Williams 335 85 1988 Fantl et al. 69 413 1992 .

In many cases PIP2 and PIP3 recruit Akt the product of the human homologue of the viral oncogene v Akt to the plasma membrane where it acts as a nodal point for many intracellular signaling pathways important for growth and survival Fantl et al. Cell 69 413 423 1992 Bader et al. 5 921 2005 Vivanco and Sawyer 2 489 2002 . Aberrant regulation of PI3K which often increases survival through Akt activation is one of the most prevalent events in human cancer and has been shown to occur at multiple levels. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN which dephosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3 position of the inositol ring and in so doing antagonizes PI3K activity is functionally deleted in a variety of tumors. In other tumors the genes for the p110 isoform PIK3CA and for Akt are amplified and increased protein expression of their gene products has been demonstrated in several human cancers. Furthermore mutations and translocation of p85 that serve to up regulate the p85 p110 complex have been described in a few human cancers. Finally somatic missense mutations in PIK3CA that activate downstream signaling pathways have been described at significant frequencies in a wide diversity of human cancers Kang at el. 102 802 2005 Samuels et al. 304 554 2004 Samuels et al. 7 561 573 2005 . These observations show that deregulation of phosphoinositol 3 kinase and the upstream and downstream components of this signaling pathway is one of the most common deregulations associated with human cancers and proliferative diseases Parsons et al. 436 792 2005 Hennessey at el. 4 988 1004 2005 .

Phosphotidylinositol 3 kinase PI3K mediates the signal from various growth factors to regulate cell proliferation and survival. A Serine Threonine Ser Thr or S T protein kinase termed Akt is identified as a downstream target of PI 3 kinase. This protein kinase is recruited to the cell membrane by interaction of its pleckstrin homology domain with PI3K products phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 triphosphate PIP and phosphatidylinositol 3 4 biphosphate PIP where it is activated by phosphorylation of its catalytic domain by 3 Phosphoinositide dependent Kinase 1 PDK 1 . Akt is further activated by phosphorylation of a serine in its C terminal hydrophobic motif by another candidate kinase PDK 2 . The activation of Akt acts downstream to regulate additional kinases many of which are implicated in cellular processes that control survival proliferation metabolism and growth translation. PI3K can also drive cellular processes that impact transformation cellular proliferation cytoskeletal rearrangement and survival through a parallel pathway that does not involve Akt Hennessy et al. 4 988 1004 2005 . Two of these pathways are activation of the small GTP binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 and activation of the serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase SGK . Cdc42 and Rac1 which regulate cytoskeletal movement and cell motility and can function as oncogenes when over expressed are also linked to the RAS pathway. Thus PI3K activity generates 3 phosphatidylinositol lipids that act as a nodal point to stimulate a diversity of downstream signaling pathways.

That these pathways impact cellular properties proliferation survival motility and morphology that are often disrupted in cancer proliferative diseases thrombotic diseases and inflammation among others suggests that compounds inhibiting PI3K and isoforms thereof have utility either as a single agent or in combination in the treatment of these diseases. In cancer deregulation of the PI3K Akt pathway is extensively documented including overexpression of the PIK3CA gene activating mutations of the PIK3CA gene overexpression of Akt mutations of PDK 1 and deletions inactivation of PTEN Parsons et al. 436 792 2005 Hennessy et al. 4 988 2005 Stephens et al. 5 1 2005 Bonneau and Longy 16 109 2000 and Ali et al. 91 1922 1999 . Recent findings indicate that PIK3CA is frequently mutated 30 in various solid tumors in humans Samuels and Ericson 18 77 2005 and the most frequent of these mutations promote cell growth and invasion Samuels et al. 7 561 2005 and are transforming Kang et al. 102 802 2005 Zhao et al. 102 18443 2005 . Thus inhibitors of PI3K particularly of the p110 isoform encoded by PIK3CA and its mutations will be useful in the treatment of cancers driven by these mutations and deregulations.

Agents of the invention in particular those which have selectivity for PI3 kinase gamma inhibition are particularly useful in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases resulting for example in reduction of tissue damage airways inflammation bronchial hyperreactivity remodeling or disease progression.

As described above since PI3K serves as a second messenger node that integrates parallel signaling pathways evidence is emerging that the combination of a PI3K inhibitor with inhibitors of other pathways will be useful in treating cancer and proliferative diseases in humans 

Approximately 20 30 of human breast cancers overexpress Her 2 neu ErbB2 the target for the drug trastuzumab. Although trastuzumab has demonstrated durable responses in some patients expressing Her2 neu ErbB2 only a subset of these patients respond. Recent work has indicated that this limited response rate can be substantially improved by the combination of trastuzumab with inhibitors of PI3K or the PI3K AKT pathway Chan et al. 91 187 2005 Woods Ignatoski et al. 82 666 2000 Nagata et al. 6 117 2004 .

A variety of human malignancies express activating mutations or increased levels of Her1 EGFR and a number of antibody and small molecule inhibitors have been developed against this receptor tyrosine kinase including tarceva gefitinib and erbitux. However while EGFR inhibitors demonstrate anti tumor activity in certain human tumors e.g. NSCLC they fail to increase overall patient survival in all patients with EGFR expressing tumors. This may be rationalized by the fact that many downstream targets of Her1 EGFR are mutated or deregulated at high frequencies in a variety of malignancies including the PI3K Akt pathway. For example gefitinib inhibits the growth of an adenocarcinoma cell line in in vitro assays. Nonetheless sub clones of these cell lines can be selected that are resistant to gefitinib that demonstrate increased activation of the PI3 Akt pathway. Downregulation or inhibition of this pathway renders the resistant sub clones sensitive to gefitinib Kokubo et al. 92 1711 2005 . Furthermore in an in vitro model of breast cancer with a cell line that harbors a PTEN mutation and over expresses EGFR inhibition of both the PI3K Akt pathway and EGFR produced a synergistic effect She et al. 8 287 297 2005 . These results indicate that the combination of gefitinib and PI3K Akt pathway inhibitors would be an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer.

The combination of AEE778 an inhibitor of Her 2 neu ErbB2 VEGFR and EGFR and RAD001 an inhibitor of mTOR a downstream target of Akt produced greater combined efficacy that either agent alone in a glioblastoma xenograft model Goudar et al. 4 101 112 2005 .

Anti estrogens such as tamoxifen inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently it has been shown that activation of the Ras Raf MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated thereby contributing to anti estrogen resistance Donovan et al 276 40888 2001 . As reported by Donovan at al. inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment with MEK inhibitor reversed the aberrant phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refractory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Similarly phosphorylation of p27Kip by Akt also abrogates its role to arrest the cell cycle Viglietto et al. 8 1145 2002 . Accordingly in one aspect the compounds of formula I may be used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers such as breast and prostate cancers to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer agents.

In hematological cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia CML chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR Ab1 tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to imatinib a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor as a result of inhibition of Ab1 kinase activity. However many patients with advanced stage disease respond to imatinib initially but then relapse later due to resistance conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BCR Ab1 employs the Ras Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In addition inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional protection against resistance conferring mutations. Accordingly in another aspect of the invention the compounds of formula I are used in combination with at least one additional agent such as Gleevec in the treatment of hematological cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia CML to reverse or prevent resistance to at least one additional agent.

Because activation of the PI3K Akt pathway drives cell survival inhibition of the pathway in combination with therapies that drive apoptosis in cancer cells including radiotherapy and chemotherapy will result in improved responses Ghobrial et al. 55 178 194 2005 . As an example combination of PI3 kinase inhibitor with carboplatin demonstrated synergistic effects in both in vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays as well as in in vivo tumor efficacy in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer Westfall and Skinner Mol.

In addition to cancer and proliferative diseases there is accumulating evidence that inhibitors of Class 1A and 1B PI3 kinases would be therapeutically useful in others disease areas. The inhibition of p110 the PI3K isoform product of the PIK3CB gene has been shown to be involved in shear induced platelet activation Jackson et al. 11 507 514 2005 . Thus a PI3K inhibitor that inhibits p110 would be useful as a single agent or in combination in anti thrombotic therapy. The isoform p110 the product of the PIK3CD gene is important in B cell function and differentiation Clayton et al. 196 753 763 2002 T cell dependent and independent antigen responses Jou et al. 22 8580 8590 2002 and mast cell differentiation Ali et al. 431 1007 1011 2004 . Thus it is expected that p110 inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of B cell driven autoimmune diseases and asthma. Finally the inhibition of p110 the isoform product of the PI3KCG gene results in reduced T but not B cell response Reif et al. J. Immunol. 173 2236 2240 2004 and its inhibition demonstrates efficacy in animal models of autoimmune diseases Camps et al. Nature Medicine 11 936 943 2005 Barber et al. Nature Medicine 11 933 935 2005 .

The PI3K inhibitors of this invention as described herein can be administered in the form of acid addition salts. The salts are conveniently formed by reacting a compound if basic with a suitable acid such as have been described above. The salts are quickly formed in high yields at moderate temperatures and often are prepared by merely isolating the compound from a suitable acidic wash as the final step of the synthesis. The salt forming acid is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent or aqueous organic solvent such as an alkanol ketone or ester. On the other hand if the compound of this invention is desired in the free base form it is isolated from a basic final wash step according to the usual practice. A preferred technique for preparing hydrochlorides is to dissolve the free base in a suitable solvent and dry the solution thoroughly as over molecular sieves before bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through it. It will also be recognized that it is possible to administer amorphous forms of the PI3K inhibitors.

The invention also provides isotopically labeled PI3K inhibitors which are structurally identical to those disclosed above but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous sulfur fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C N O O P P S F and Cl respectively. Compounds of the present invention prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds and of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out known or referenced procedures and by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

The compounds of the invention are useful in vitro or in vivo in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. The compounds may be used alone or in compositions together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor compound described herein formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier means a non toxic inert solid semi solid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose glucose and sucrose starches such as corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes oils such as peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil glycols such a propylene glycol esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate agar buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide alginic acid pyrogen free water isotonic saline Ringer s solution ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions as well as other non toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate as well as coloring agents releasing agents coating agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition according to the judgment of the formulator.

Injectable preparations for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 propanediol or 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or di glycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.

In order to prolong the effect of a drug it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations may also be prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.

Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.

Effective amounts of the compounds of the invention generally include any amount sufficient to detectably inhibit PI3K activity by any of the assays described herein by other PI3K activity assays known to those having ordinary skill in the art or by detecting an inhibition or alleviation of symptoms of cancer. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood however that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration route of administration rate of excretion drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The therapeutically effective amount for a given situation can be readily determined by routine experimentation and is within the skill and judgment of the ordinary clinician.

According to the methods of treatment of the present invention tumor growth is reduced or prevented in a patient such as a human or lower mammal by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. By a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is meant a sufficient amount of the compound to treat tumor growth at a reasonable benefit risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood however that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder the activity of the specific compound employed the specific composition employed the age body weight general health sex and diet of the patient the time of administration route of administration and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed the duration of the treatment drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts.

For purposes of the present invention a therapeutically effective dose will generally be a total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts for example of from 0.001 to 1000 mg kg body weight daily and more preferred from 1.0 to 30 mg kg body weight daily. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily close. In general treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 2000 mg of the compound s of this invention per day in single or multiple doses.

In another aspect of the invention kits that include one or more compounds of the invention are provided. Representative kits include a PI3K inhibitor compound of the invention e.g. a compound of formulas I III and a package insert or other labeling including directions for treating a cellular proliferative disease by administering an PI3K inhibitory amount of the compound.

The term kit as used herein comprises a container for containing the pharmaceutical compositions and may also include divided containers such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a pharmaceutically acceptable material for example a paper or cardboard box a glass or plastic bottle or jar a resealable bag for example to hold a refill of tablets for placement into a different container or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The container employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example tablets may be contained in a bottle which is in turn contained within a box.

An example of such a kit is a so called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms tablets capsules and the like . Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of individual tablets or capsules to be packed or may have the size and shape to accommodate multiple tablets and or capsules to be packed. Next the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses accordingly and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result the tablets or capsules are individually sealed or collectively sealed as desired in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.

It maybe desirable to provide a written memory aid where the written memory aid is of the type containing information and or instructions for the physician pharmacist or other health care provider or subject e.g. in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested or a card which contains the same type of information. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card e.g. as follows First Week Monday Tuesday Second Week Monday Tuesday . . . Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A daily dose can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day. When the kit contains separate compositions a daily dose of one or more compositions of the kit can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of another one or more compositions of the kit can consist of several tablets or capsules.

Another specific embodiment of a kit is a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use. Preferably the dispenser is equipped with a memory aid so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory aid is a battery powered micro chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout or audible reminder signal which for example reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.

The kits of the present invention may also comprise in addition to a PI3K inhibitor one or more additional pharmaceutically active compounds. Preferably the additional compound is another PI3K inhibitor or another compound useful to treat cancer angiogenesis or tumor growth. The additional compounds may be administered in the same dosage form as the PI3K inhibitor or in different dosage forms. Likewise the additional compounds can be administered at the same time as the PI3K inhibitor or at different times.

The present invention will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.

The plates are briefly centrifuged to remove any air gap. The reaction is performed for 15 minutes and then stopped by the addition of 20 L of 100 mM EDTA. The stopped reaction is incubated overnight at RT to allow the lipid substrate to bind by hydrophobic interaction to the surface of the flashplate. The liquid in the wells is then washed away and the labeled substrate is detected with scintillation counting.

This method is similar to Assay 1 except that the lipid substrate 1 alpha phosphatidylinositol PIP is first dissolved in a coating buffer and incubated on flashplate at room temperature overnight to allow the lipid substrate to bind by hydrophobic interaction to the surface of the flashplate. Unbound substrate is then washed away. On the day of assay 20 L of 6 nM PI3 kinase are added into each well followed by 20 L of 400 nM ATP containing trace of radiolabeled ATP. Compounds are added together with enzyme and ATP to the lipid coated plates. The plates are briefly centrifuged to remove any air gap. The reaction is performed for two to three hours. The reaction is stopped by addition of 20 L of 100 mM EDTA or by immediate plate washing. Phosphorylated lipid substrate is detected by scintillation counting.

Compounds to be tested are dissolved in DMSO and directly distributed into a black 384 well plate at 1.25 L per well. To start the reaction 25 L of 10 nM PI3 kinase and 5 g mL 1 alpha phosphatidylinositol PI are added into each well followed by 25 L of 2 M ATP. The reaction is performed until approx 50 of the ATP is depleted and then stopped by the addition of 25 L of KinaseGlo solution purchased from Promega. The stopped reaction is incubated for 5 minutes and the remaining ATP is then detected via luminescence.

In this method an assay for measuring the PI3K mediated pSer473 Akt status after treatment with representative inhibitor compounds of the invention is described.

A2780 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS. L glutamine sodium pyruvate and antibiotics. Cells were plated in the same medium at a density of 15 000 cells per well into 96 well tissue culture plates with outside wells vacant and allowed to adhere overnight.

Test compounds supplied in DMSO were diluted further into DMSO at 500 times the desired final concentrations before dilution into culture media to 2 times the final concentrations. Equal volumes of 2 compounds were added to the cells in 96 well plates and incubated at 37 C. for one hour. The media and compounds were then removed the plates chilled and cells lysed in a lysis buffer 150 mM NaCl 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 1 mM EDTA 1 mM EGTA 1 Triton X 100 supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. After thorough mixing lysates were transferred to both pSer473Akt and total Akt assay plates from Meso Scale Discovery MSD and incubated overnight with shaking at 4 C. The plates were washed with 1 MSD wash buffer and the captured analytes detected with secondary antibodies. After incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 2 hours the plates were washed again and 1.5 concentration of Read Buffer T MSD was added to the wells.

The assays were read on a SECTOR Imager 6000 instrument Meso Scale Discovery . Ratios of the signal from pSer473Akt and total Akt assays were used to correct for any variability and the percent inhibition of pSer473Akt from the total signal seen in cells treated with compound versus DMSO alone was calculated and used to determine ECvalues for each compound.

A2780 ovarian cancer cells obtained from George Coukos Fox Chase Cancer Center University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia Pa. were maintained in DMEM Invitrogen Inc. supplemented with 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum with 1 glutamine. Cells were propagated as recommended by the Dr. Coukos and colleagues. Female nu nu mice 8 12 weeks old 20 25 g Charles River were used for all in vivo pharmacology studies. The mice were housed and maintained in accordance with state and federal guidelines for the humane treatment and care of laboratory animals and received food and water ad libitum. Cancer cells were harvested from mid log phase cultures using trypsin EDTA Invitrogen Inc. . Five million cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of each mouse. Compound treatment was initiated when tumor size reached to 300 400 mmfor PK PD studies and 200 300 mmfor efficacy studies. All compound treatment was administrated orally. Tumor volumes were determined by using StudyDirector software.

For in vivo target modulation PK PD time course studies tumor tissues were resected from individual mice at different time points ranging from 30 min to 36 hr after a single dose of compound 60 or 100 mg kg or vehicle was administrated orally. For PK PD dose dependent studies tumor bearing mice were given a single oral dose of compound at different concentrations 10 30 60 and 100 mg kg or vehicle and tumors were resected at 10 hr or 24 hr after dosing. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture using a syringe primed with heparin sulfate. Resected tumors were snap frozen on dry ice and pulverized using a liquid nitrogen cooled cryomortar and pestle and lysed in cold cell extraction buffer Bio source containing protease inhibitor tablet Complete EDTA free Amersham . Supernatants were taken after centrifugation of tumor lysates at 300 g for 10 min at 4 C. and the protein concentration in each supernatant was determined by BCA BioRad . An equal amount of protein from each tumor lysate was loaded onto 10 Tris glycine gels Invitrogen for sodiumdoceylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE after which proteins were transferred from the gel onto PVDF membrane. Membranes were probed with antibodies that recognize phosphoAktor phosphoAkt Cell Signaling followed by secondary goat anti rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP Amersham . Positive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with X ray film. Similar procedures were used to determine total AKT in the same tumor lysates to serve as normalization for total protein in each determination. The density of the positive band on the X ray film was scanned and the target modulation for each compound was expressed as percentage inhibition by each compound compared to vehicle treatment. A rank order 75 as compared to vehicle treatment of target inhibition is used to present compound target modulation activity.

For efficacy studies A2780 cancer cells 5 10in 100 l of DMEM culture medium were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each nu nu mouse. When average tumor sizes reached about 200 mmmice were dosed orally daily q.d. or twice a day b.i.d. at three different compound concentrations typically at 10 30 and 100 mg kg in 100 l incipient. Tumor growth and animal body weight was measured twice weekly with daily clinical observation to monitor potential toxicities related to the treatment. Typically studies were terminated when tumors in vehicle treated group reached 2500 mmor adverse clinical effects were observed. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway results in the phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecule Akt at Serand or Thr. Compound modulation of Aktphosphorylation was examined in A2780 xenograft tumors at time points ranging from 30 min to 36 hr after a single compound dose at 60 or 100 mg kg. Table 2 summarizes modulation of AKTphosphorylation by representative compounds at 8 hr or 10 hr time points. Percentage inhibition was ranked as 75 as compared to vehicle treatment.

Efficacy of Compound 91 was tested in the A2780 tumor xenograft model. Mice bearing A2780 tumors received oral administration of Compound 91 twice daily at 10 and 60 mg kg. Tumor growth inhibition 50 was observed at 60 mg kg treatment while at 10 mg kg no inhibitory activity was observed .

The modest tumor growth inhibition by Compound 91 at 60 mg kg q.d. was due to its short lived target modulation 50 inhibition lasted for 8 hr . Therefore antitumor efficacy of three other compounds Compound 10 Compound 76 and Compound 66 that demonstrated longer inhibition of Akt 50 inhibition 10 hr in A2780 tumors were evaluated in A2780 model. Compounds were orally administrated daily when tumor sizes reached to about 200 mm. Compound 10 demonstrated a dose dependent tumor growth inhibition 40 at 30 mg kg 70 at 60 mg kg and tumor growth stasis at 100 mg kg . A similar dose dependent tumor growth inhibition was observed with Compound 76 treatment at 30 and 60 mg kg in the A2780 tumor model while Compound 84 was found to possess weaker antitumor activity 

Antitumor activity of Compound 10 was also evaluated at more frequent dosing regimen b.i.d . As shown in Compound 10 demonstrated a significant antitumor activity at 30 mg kg when orally dosed b.i.d. Notably tumor growth inhibition at 30 mg kg b.i.d. was more potent than when dosed on a schedule at an equivalent daily dose 60 mg kg . The compounds were well tolerated in this study. This result indicated that a sustained but less profound target inhibition covering the whole dosing period but with 

While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

The ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit cellular proliferation were determined by using Cell Titer Glo a commercially available assay from Promega Corporation. A2780 ovarian cancer cells were seeded in TC treated 96 well plates at a density of 1 000 per well in DMEM 10 FBS 1 Sodium Pyruvate and 1 Penicillin Streptomycin for a minimum of 2 hrs prior to addition of compound. For each concentration of test compound 2 l 500 aliquots of compound or 100 DMSO diluted in 500 l of culture medium for 2 concentration then diluted 1 on the Cells. Cells were incubated for 72 hrs at 37 C. 5 CO. After the 72 hour incubation Cell Titer Glo reagent is added to determine number of viable cells remaining after exposure to the compound and the ECvalue was calculated. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer s instruction Promega Corporation Madison Wis. USA . Each experimental condition was performed in duplicate. The results are provided in Table 1
