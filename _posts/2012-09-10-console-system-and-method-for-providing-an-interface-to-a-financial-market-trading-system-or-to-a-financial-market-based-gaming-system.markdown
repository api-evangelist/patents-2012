This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 493 556 filed on Jun. 29 2009 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 077 180 filed on Jul. 1 2008 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 077 181 filed on Jul. 1 2008 each of which are hereby incorporated into this application by reference in their entirety.

The present invention generally relates to the field of Financial Market related trading and gaming. More specifically the present invention relates to a console system and method for providing an interface to a financial market trading system or to a financial market based gaming system.

Electronic trading sometimes called e trading is a method of trading securities such as stocks and bonds currencies exchange traded derivatives and other financial instruments via distributed data networks electronically. Electronic trading generally uses information technology systems such as the internet and proprietary networks to bring together buyers and sellers on electronic trading platforms to create virtual market places which augment or connect with existing trading systems. NASDAQ NYSE Arca and Globex are examples of markets which are augmented with and or strongly interconnected to electronic trading systems. Exchanges that facilitate electronic trading in the United States are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC and are generally called electronic communication networks or ECNs.

The foreign exchange market Forex or FX is where currency trading takes place. Forex trading is defined as the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. The currency of one country is exchanged for that of another. The currencies may be traded in pairs such as US Dollar Japanese Yen Euro US Dollar Brazilian Real Jordanian Dinar and so on.

At or about 1996 on line retail Forex trading became practical. Internet based market makers would take the opposite side of retail trader s trades. These companies also created a retail Forex platform that provided a quick and easy way for individuals to buy and sell on the Forex spot market

Nowadays one can trade virtually any financial instrument online through a variety of electronic trading service providers. In order to trade however one must be connected to the appropriate service provider and have an agreement and account with said service provider. A stand alone interface which anyone can walk up to deposit funds in and trade on is yet unknown.

At the same time a plethora of gaming sites is available online. Anyone who so desires can connect to such a site and play virtually any known game of chance for money. Again in order to play one must be connected to the appropriate gaming service provider and must have an agreement and account with said gaming service provider. Unlike the previous example stand alone interfaces to which anyone can walk up to deposit funds and play are readily available.

Most games of chance are based on a random element event outcome which determines whether a game participant wins or losses. This element can be a slot where a ball falls Roulette a random card Blackjack poker etc. a roll of dice craps a combination of reel spins Slots a combination of numbered balls drawn randomly from a large group Keno or Bingo or any other unpredictable random event. Therefore as the determining event is completely random a participant in such a game has little to no control over his chances of winning and is left to depend on good fortune to gain money from the game.

Another form of gaming available online is based on exterior events which are not random but at the same time are not easily predictable. In these forms of games the outcome of an exterior event determines whether the participant wins or losses. An example of such gaming is sports betting. As the outcome of sporting events is not random so a participant in such a game can improve his chances of winning the more he she knows about the event. Such gaming is also available based on non sporting events. For example one can bet online who will win a particular award e.g. Oscar for Best Picture what will be the first commercial aired during the Superbowl or even who will win an election. A game however where the determining event is the behavior trade details of a specific financial instrument on a specific market is unknown.

The present invention is a console system and method for providing an interface to a financial market trading system or to a financial market based gaming system. According to some embodiments of the present invention there may be provided one or more financial markets related gaming or trading consoles which one or more consoles may be networked directly or through a distributed network with a server or server cluster including at least one transaction server. According to some embodiments of the present invention the server or server cluster may be integral with the consol. According to further embodiments of the present invention the transaction server and or server cluster may be further networked directly or through a distributed network with a control terminal s an administration terminal remote devices brokers financial institutions market data providers and or a trading server.

According to some embodiments of the present invention the financial markets related gaming or trading console s may include one or more displays one or more user interface assemblies one or more payment receipt modules i.e. cash credit card tokens other cards and or any other known payment method a communication module and a processor adapted to regulate the operation of all the console s constituent components in the context of a F.I. associated trading gaming environment. The processor may be functionally associated with the communication module. The communication module may be adapted to communicate over a data network with one or more servers including a transaction server a gaming server and or any other server types functionally relevant to F.I. based trading or gaming.

According to some embodiments of the present invention the server cluster may include a transaction server a router switch an accounts database a F.I. related data database a game data base a trading module a F.I. related data analyzer a gateway a gaming server and or any other server types functionally relevant to F.I. based trading or gaming. The servers within the cluster may each be functionally associated with a communication module. Any and all computational architecture known today or to be devised in the future may be applicable to the present invention.

It should be understood by one of skill in the art that the servers and or server cluster may reside in one or a set of physical servers and possibly across sets of redundant physical servers.

The console s may include one or more displays adapted to display information and graphics to the user and a user interface assembly adapted to receive input commands from the user through a customized keypad an indicator device such as a mouse a screen sensitive to touch any other input device known today or to be devised in the future or any combination thereof.

The console s possibly in conjunction with the transaction server through one or more data communication modules may be adapted to display to the user data relating to the trading of F.I. s on numerous exchanges which provide platforms for trading F.I. s. Said data may be displayed in any form including but not limited to graphs charts detailed lists or a combination thereof. The F.I. related data analyzer may be adapted to analyze said data according to any known F.I. behavioral model and or compare different characteristics and or behavior trade details of different F.I. s and display via the console s said analysis and or comparison to the user in visual form. According to some further embodiments of the present invention said display may be structured like a game e.g. a video game .

According to some embodiments of the current invention the transaction server possibly in conjunction with the F.I. data analyzer may be adapted to modify the behavior trade details data e.g. prices displayed to the user so as to factor in a commission for the F.I.G.T. system s proprietor. The transaction server may be further adapted to display via the console said commission s rate to the user. Accordingly every trade performed for the user by the F.I.G.T. system may inherently result in the user being charged said commission by the transaction server.

The console s possibly in conjunction with the transaction server may be adapted to facilitate through one or more data communication modules trade of any F.I. on any one of a selection of exchanges where said F.I. is traded for the user. Said trade may be performed by a broker and or a trading server. The user may be allowed to input any trading instruction known today or that may be devised in the future e.g. buy sell buy short etc. . According to a further embodiment of the present invention the console may be adapted to communicate multiple trade instructions to the transaction server in response to a single input by the user.

While trading a user may be accorded leverage by the system based on 1 the funds he she has deposited 2 the specific F.I. being traded 3 the quantity of the F.I. being traded 4 the amount risked in a specific trade and or 5 pre defined criteria or by specific allowance from the administrator of the system or his her agent. According to further embodiments of the present invention the F.I.G.T. system may be associated with security accounts which security accounts may be dedicated to secure greater leverage from brokers when trading F.I. s via said brokers i.e. augmenting the user s deposited funds in order to obtain a larger margin .

The console s possibly in conjunction with the transaction server and or the gaming server may be further adapted to facilitate through one or more data communication modules one or more games for participants in which the outcome of the game is determined according to the behavior trade details and or according to a characteristic e.g. one or more digits of the numerical value of a behavior trade detail of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded. Accordingly each action taken by the user in any one of the games may be translated into a trade instruction or instructions relating to one or more F.I. s.

The game may be in the form of simulate and or have a look and feel like known arcade games or games of chance where the random element of a typical game of chance or the skill element of a typical arcade game is replaced by the behavior trade details of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded. Thus for example the game may be a simulation of Roulette where instead of the winning number being determined by the slot of the wheel into which the ball falls the winning number is determined by a movement of the price of a specific F.I. Similarly the game may be a simulation of blackjack where instead of drawing random cards from a shuffled deck the drawn cards are determined based on the behavior trade details of specific F.I. s on specific exchanges. The console s may display to the user a display similar to the game it is simulating data relating to the to the determining behavior trade detail along with an explanation of said determining factor and it s affect on the game.

The game may also be a simulation of a sport in which the outcome of the game is determined according to the behavior trade details of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded. Thus for example the game may be a simulation of a boxing match where each boxer represents one F.I. In this example each boxer s behavior e.g. movement number and strength of punches evasive defensive moves score etc. in the match may reflect the respective F.I. s behavior trade details on the exchange e.g. every time the respective F.I. s price goes up the Boxer punches his opponent . According to further embodiments of the present invention the game may be a simulation of a game of strategy e.g. chess go checkers etc.

The game may also include a challenge to directly predict the future behavior trade details of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded.

The console s may be further adapted to allow the user to select the specific F.I. s and or the specific behavior trade detail that will serve to determine the result of the game. The console s may also allow the user select F.I. and interface game combinations.

The duration of any game and or the timing of the sale of a F.I. purchased by a user may be determined by the user by a predetermined time limit by the expiration of an option and or when the user has reached a specific limit of gain or loss i.e. stop loss take profit .

The code for each of the one or more games may be stored on one or more data storage devices functionally associated with the gaming server. According to further embodiments of the present invention the code may be stored on one or more storage devices functionally associated to the console s .

According to some embodiments of the present invention the transaction server or an associated module may be adapted to generate a set of automated trade orders e.g. buy order sell order stop order etc. collectively referred to as a trading strategy corresponding to a user input within a given gaming interface scheme. According to some embodiments of the present invention the transaction server possibly in conjunction with the F.I. data analyzer may be adapted to calculate create trading strategies that represent each possible action the user may take within any of the games. According to further embodiments of the present invention said calculation creation may be performed by the console or may be pre programmed into the specific game s code. According to yet further embodiments of the present invention the transaction server possibly in conjunction with the F.I. related data analyzer and or the trading module may be further adapted to communicate trade instructions to brokers and or the trading server in accordance with said calculations so as to build positions in the market to represent any actions made by the users on the F.I.G.T. system i.e. to purchase sell or otherwise trade F.I. s so that any gains or losses accrued by the user in his use of the F.I.G.T. system will be gained or lost in the market.

According to some embodiments of the present invention there may be provided a F.I. related data analyzer adapted to determine the odds of any future behavior trade details of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded actually occurring. This determination may be based on a calculation performed by the F.I. related data analyzer on a calculation performed by a third party who specializes in financial market predictions or a combination thereof. The transaction server may be further adapted to modify the odds so as to factor in a profit for the F.I.G.T. system s proprietor. The calculated odds may serve to assist in correlating trade orders with possible actions that may be made by a user in said games.

According to some embodiments of the present invention the transaction server or servers may be adapted to communicate through a communication application e.g. VPN etc. or an application programming interface API via the gateway with 1 a broker 2 financial institutions 3 market data providers 4 a trading server 5 remote devices and or 6 with an administration terminal.

The transaction server may also be adapted to acquire directly or through a third party from market data providers brokers and or the trading server Behavior Trade Details of F.I. s on one or more exchanges which provide platforms for the trading of F.I. s.

The transaction server may be further adapted to communicate via the trading module trade instructions to brokers and or to the trading server. The trading server may be adapted to serve as a broker i.e. provide a platform for trading in F.I. s. For this purpose the F.I.G.T system may be associated with one or more trading accounts maintained by a broker or directly with a F.I. exchange which accounts may be unique to each console unique to the F.I.G.T system shared between a number of F.I.G.T systems or any combination thereof.

The transaction server may be further adapted to create and maintain on an associated database sub accounts of a trading account and or user accounts for users in which sub account and or user accounts users may deposit funds through the payment module using one or more of any known funding methods possibly including online funding methods. The payment module may include a magnetic card reader a bill note receptacle a coin receptacle and or any other means of depositing collecting funds. According to further embodiments of the present invention there may be provided a payment module independent of the console s manned or unmanned functionally associated with the transaction server over a data network. Said sub accounts and or user accounts may be maintained temporarily as long as the user is using the system a session or across multiple sessions.

According to some embodiments of the present invention the transaction server may be adapted to communicate over a data network with financial institutions including credit providers to facilitate transactions. The transaction server may be further adapted to credit or debit the user s account based on his activity on the F.I.G.T. system.

The transaction server may be further adapted to payout the user a remaining balance in his her account in any known form of payment either directly or via an agent including but not limited to transferring the funds to the user s bank credit trading account with an external financial institution or credit provider.

The administration terminal may be adapted to allow an administrator of one or more F.I.G.T. systems to control and or modify the functions of any of the other components of the F.I.G.T. systems and may be further adapted to receive from any of the other components of the F.I.G.T. systems data relating to their function and to display this data to said administrator.

The control terminal may be adapted to allow a local venue administrator of a F.I.G.T. system to control and or modify some of the functions of any of the other components of the F.I.G.T. system and may be further adapted to receive from any of the other components of the F.I.G.T. system data relating to their function and to display this data to said local venue administrator. The administration terminal may be adapted to define and or modify the functions the control terminal is authorized to control and or modify.

The transaction server may be further adapted to calculate the taxes owed by the user for any profits gained while trading gaming on the F.I.G.T. system and may be even further adapted to withhold these taxes from the user s payout.

The console s may be further adapted to print a written receipt for the user depicting the details of his activity on the F.I.G.T. system including details of deposits payouts withheld taxes and so on.

According to some further embodiments of the present invention there may be provided a console including multiple displays payment modules and user interface assemblies that may be adapted to allow multiple users to participate in a single game. According to yet further embodiments of the present invention consoles may be collocated to form gaming arenas which may be supervised by an agent of the administrator of the system.

According to some further embodiments of the present invention the transaction server may be adapted to display to users upon a remote device a display similar to the one displayed upon the console and may be further adapted to allow users to perform via a remote device any action that may be performed via the console s interface i.e. the remote device will serve as a remote console creating what is known in the art as a cross platform.

According to further embodiments of the present invention instead of the customary method of allowing the user to select the amount of the investment the console may be adapted to allow the user to select the amount to he she will profit or lose for each unit of movement in the behavior trade detail of the F.I. being traded. Subsequently the transaction server may translate the user s selection to an appropriate amount to be invested.

It should be understood by one of skill in the art that some of the functions described as being performed by a specific component of the system may be performed by a different component of the system in other embodiments of this invention.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.

Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussions it is appreciated that throughout the specification discussions utilizing terms such as processing computing calculating determining or the like refer to the action and or processes of a computer or computing system or similar electronic computing device that manipulate and or transform data represented as physical such as electronic quantities within the computing system s registers and or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system s memories registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices. The term server may refer to a single server or to a functionally associated cluster of servers.

Embodiments of the present invention may include apparatuses for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the desired purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium such as but is not limited to any type of disk including floppy disks optical disks CD ROMs magnetic optical disks read only memories ROMs random access memories RAMs electrically programmable read only memories EPROMs electrically erasable and programmable read only memories EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards or any other type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions and capable of being coupled to a computer system bus.

The processes and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein or it may prove convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the desired method. The desired structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition embodiments of the present invention are not described with reference to any particular programming language.

Terms in this application relating to distributed data networking such as send or receive may be interpreted in reference to Internet protocol suite which is a set of communications protocols that implement the protocol stack on which the Internet and most commercial networks run. It has also been referred to as the TCP IP protocol suite which is named after two of the most important protocols in it the Transmission Control Protocol TCP and the Internet Protocol IP which were also the first two networking protocols defined. Today s IP networking represents a synthesis of two developments that began in the 1970s namely LANs Local Area Networks and the Internet both of which have revolutionized computing.

The Internet Protocol suite like many protocol suites can be viewed as a set of layers. Each layer solves a set of problems involving the transmission of data and provides a well defined service to the upper layer protocols based on using services from some lower layers. Upper layers are logically closer to the user and deal with more abstract data relying on lower layer protocols to translate data into forms that can eventually be physically transmitted. The TCP IP reference model consists of four layers.

The IP suite uses encapsulation to provide abstraction of protocols and services. Generally a protocol at a higher level uses a protocol at a lower level to help accomplish its aims. The Internet protocol stack has never been altered by the IETF from the four layers defined in RFC 1122. The IETF makes no effort to follow the seven layer OSI model and does not refer to it in standards track protocol specifications and other architectural documents.

It should be understood that any topology technology and or standard for computer networking e.g. mesh networks infiniband connections RDMA etc. known today or to be devised in the future may be applicable to the present invention.

The present invention is a console system and method for providing an interface to a financial market trading system or to a financial market based gaming system. The invention enables the trader to trade on financial markets using an interface simulating known and popular games from the world of sports arcade games of chance strategic games and the like. Thus the trader may have an enjoyable and exciting experience whilst trading. Said Game simulations due to their association with financial markets are calculated and not random. According to some of the teachings of the invention the random and or skill elements of the simulated games are replaced by the behavior trade details of traded financial instruments and all of their derivatives. According to some further embodiments of the present invention graphic schemes imitating the simulated games contribute even further to the traders experience.

According to some embodiments of the present invention there may be provided one or more financial markets related gaming or trading consoles exemplified in which one or more consoles may be networked directly or through a distributed network with a server or server cluster exemplified in including at least one transaction server. According to some embodiments of the present invention the server or server cluster may be integral with the console. According to further embodiments of the present invention the transaction server and or server cluster may be further networked directly or through a distributed network with a control terminal s an administration terminal remote devices brokers financial institutions market data providers and or a trading server. an exemplary functional block diagram of the system as a whole according to some embodiments of the present invention can be seen in .

According to some embodiments of the present invention the financial markets related gaming or trading console s may include one or more displays one or more user interface assemblies one or more payment receipt modules i.e. cash credit card tokens other cards and or any other known payment method a communication module and a processor adapted to regulate the operation of all the console s constituent components in the context of a F.I. associated trading gaming environment. The processor may be functionally associated with the communication module an exemplary functional block diagram of a console according to some embodiments of the present invention can be seen in . The communication module may be adapted to communicate over a data network with one or more servers including a transaction server a gaming server and or any other server types functionally relevant to F.I. based trading or gaming.

According to some embodiments of the present invention the server cluster may include a transaction server a router switch an accounts database a F.I. related data database a game data base a trading module a F.I. related data analyzer a gateway a gaming server and or any other server types functionally relevant to F.I. based trading or gaming. The servers within the cluster may each be functionally associated with a communication module. Any and all computational architecture known today or to be devised in the future may be applicable to the present invention.

It should be understood by one of skill in the art that the servers and or server cluster may reside in one or a set of physical servers and possibly across sets of redundant physical servers.

The console s may include one or more displays adapted to display information and graphics to the user and a user interface assembly adapted to receive input commands from the user through a customized keypad an indicator device such as a mouse a screen sensitive to touch any other input device known today or to be devised in the future or any combination thereof.

The console s possibly in conjunction with the transaction server through one or more data communication modules may be adapted to display to the user data relating to the trading of F.I. s on numerous exchanges which provide platforms for trading F.I. s. Said data may be displayed in any form including but not limited to graphs charts detailed lists or a combination thereof. The F.I. related data analyzer may be adapted to analyze said data according to any known F.I. behavioral model and or compare different characteristics and or behavior trade details of different F.I. s and display via the console s said analysis and or comparison to the user in visual form. According to some further embodiments of the present invention said display may be structured like a game e.g. a video game . According to further embodiments of the present invention said F.I. related data analysis and or comparisons may be displayed on a separate display included in the console or located within view of one or more consoles and or any combination thereof.

According to some embodiments of the present invention the console may display a LED Candle graph which provides information relating to the price movement of a specific F.I. in relation to specified time intervals as seen in B and C. In a LED Candle graph each time interval may be represented by a column of LED s. Each column may consist of a series of LED s stretching from the lowest price the specific F.I. reached during the specific time interval to the highest wherein the LED s located between the price of the F.I. at the beginning of the time interval i.e. opening price to the price at the end of the interval i.e. closing price are lit. The color of the lit LED s may depend on the overall movement of the price within the specified time interval wherein if the closing price is higher than the opening price i.e. the price went up overall the lit LED s may be blue as seen in and if the closing price is lower than the opening price i.e. the price went down overall the lit LED s may be red as seen in . The remaining LED s in the column may appear shaded but visible. The LED Candle graph may consist of a series of such columns see .

According to some embodiments of the current invention the transaction server possibly in conjunction with the F.I. data analyzer may be adapted to modify the behavior trade details data e.g. prices displayed to the user so as to factor in a commission for the F.I.G.T. system s proprietor. The transaction server may be further adapted to display via the console said commission s rate to the user. Accordingly every trade performed for the user by the F.I.G.T. system may inherently result in the user being charged said commission by the transaction server. For example the price of a F.I. being purchased sold may be presented to the user 0.0002 units higher lower than the actual price on the relevant market. Accordingly in this example when the transaction server performs the trade for the user there will be a difference equal to 0.0002 the number of units purchased sold between the amount the user is charged credited and the actual cost consideration paid for the F.I. This difference may be retained by the system as the F.I.G.T. system s proprietor s commission. Noticeably every trade will result in two commissions one during the purchase of the F.I. and one during the sale.

The console s possibly in conjunction with the transaction server may be adapted to facilitate through one or more data communication modules trade of any F.I. on any one of a selection of exchanges where said F.I. is traded for the user. Said trade may be performed by a broker and or a trading server. The user may be allowed to input any trading instruction known today or that may be devised in the future e.g. buy sell buy short etc. . According to a further embodiment of the present invention the console may be adapted to communicate multiple trade instructions to the transaction server in response to a single input by the user e.g. the user may be able to simultaneously purchase one currency sell another currency and purchase an exotic option with one press of a button.

While trading a user may be accorded leverage by the system based on 1 the funds he she has deposited 2 the specific F.I. being traded 3 the quantity of the F.I. being traded 4 the amount risked in a specific trade and or 5 pre defined criteria or by specific allowance from the administrator of the system or his her agent. According to further embodiments of the present invention the F.I.G.T. system may be associated with security accounts which security accounts may be dedicated to secure greater leverage from brokers when trading F.I. s via said brokers i.e. augmenting the user s deposited funds in order to obtain a larger margin . Assume for example that a broker would normally allow a trader to purchase gold for 100 for every 1 he she deposits in his her sub account i.e. 1 100 leverage. Therefore a user who has deposited 50 would be able to purchase gold for up to 5 000 . Let us further assume however that the F.I.G.T. system maintains for this purpose a large security account with the broker say 50 000 . In this situation the user of the F.I.G.T. system may be allowed to purchase gold for 200 for every 1 he she deposits in his her sub account i.e. 1 200 leverage. Thus a user who has deposited 50 would be able to purchase gold for up to 10 000 with both his 50 and 50 of the F.I.G.T. system s security account serving as security for the broker who is then still only allowing 1 100 leverage. In this fashion one security account can serve to augment the leverage of many users simultaneously. By maintaining said security account the F.I.G.T. system may be able to offer users greater leverage than is customary in the market.

The console s possibly in conjunction with the transaction server and or the gaming server may be further adapted to facilitate through one or more data communication modules one or more games for participants in which the outcome of the game is determined according to the behavior trade details and or according to a characteristic e.g. one or more digits of the numerical value of a behavior trade detail of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded. Accordingly each action taken by the user in any one of the games may be translated into a trade instruction or instructions relating to one or more F.I. s.

The game may be in the form of simulate and or have a look and feel like known arcade games or games of chance where the random element of a typical game of chance or the skill element of a typical arcade game is replaced by the behavior trade details of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded. Thus for example the game may be a simulation of Roulette where instead of the winning number being determined by the slot of the wheel into which the ball falls the winning number is determined by a movement of the price of a specific F.I. Similarly the game may be a simulation of blackjack where instead of drawing random cards from a shuffled deck the drawn cards are determined based on the behavior trade details of specific F.I. s on specific exchanges. The console s may display to the user a display similar to the game it is simulating data relating to the to the determining behavior trade detail along with an explanation of said determining factor and it s affect on the game.

The game may also be a simulation of a sport in which the outcome of the game is determined according to the behavior trade details of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded. Thus for example the game may be a simulation of a boxing match where each boxer represents one F.I. In this example each boxer s behavior e.g. movement number and strength of punches evasive defensive moves score etc. in the match may reflect the respective F.I. s behavior trade details on the exchange e.g. every time the respective F.I. s price goes up the Boxer punches his opponent . According to further embodiments of the present invention the game may be a simulation of a game of strategy e.g. chess go checkers etc.

The game may also include a challenge to directly predict the future behavior trade details of one or more F.I. s on one or more exchanges where said F.I. s are traded.

The console s may be further adapted to allow the user to select the specific F.I. s and or the specific behavior trade detail that will serve to determine the result of the game. The console s may also allow the user select F.I. and interface game combinations. Behavior trade details of a F.I. may refer to any parameter relating to the trade of a given F.I. on a given exchange. For example if the F.I. is a stock then said behavior trade details may be a price of that stock during at least one moment within a certain short term period a certain digit of said price a combination of two or more digits of said price a difference between a price of that stock at a certain moment within the short term period to that stock s price during another moment a statistical value representing the behavior of that stock a volume of trade of that certain stock an amount of stock transactions a change of the price of the stock such as by points or percentage a trend in the movement of the price of the stock such as Up Down No change a spread between ask and bid a value or change pertaining to categories of stocks e.g. technology real estate etc. and or any other value relating to the trade of F.I. s.

For example if the game being simulated is roulette the determining behavior trade detail may be the movement of a specific F.I. s price during a predetermined time period. In this example each number on the roulette table i.e. 0 36 may represent a specific possible movement of said price during the specified time period wherein 1 18 may represent upward movements of said price 19 36 may represent downward movements of said price and 0 may represent no movement. The determination which number between 1 18 in the case of upward movement or which number between 19 36 in the case of downward movement is represented by said movement may be dependent on the magnitude of the price change. For example each 1 100 of a percentile of price change of the relevant F.I. may change the representative number by one i.e. if the price moved up during the specified time period by 1 100 of a percent the number may be 1 2 100 of a percentile may be 2 3 100 of a percent may be 3 and so on whereas if the price moved down during the specified time period by 1 100 of a percent the number may be 19 2 100 of a percent may be 20 and so on. In this fashion the winning number of a financial markets based game simulating roulette according to some embodiments of the present invention may be determined according to the price change of a specific F.I. during a pre determined time period.
