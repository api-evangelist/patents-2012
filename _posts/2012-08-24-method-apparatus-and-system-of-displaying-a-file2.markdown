title: Method, apparatus and system of displaying a file
abstract: A device, method and system of displaying a file on a mobile communication device may comprise duplicating at least a leftmost part of a file to obtain a duplicated leftmost part of the file, and displaying a frame through moving a display window along the frame, the frame comprising a rightmost part of the file and the duplicated leftmost part of the file, wherein the duplicated leftmost part of the file is placed on right of the rightmost part of the file. In some embodiments, the mobile communication device may control the display window to automatically move to a leftmost side of the frame, if the display window moves to a rightmost side of the frame, and further in response to a user instruction of continuing viewing the file.

Nowadays more and more people read files e.g. web pages on a mobile communication device such as a smart phone a tablet or a computer. Sometimes the file may not be optimized for displaying on a screen of the mobile communication device. For example the file may be wider than the screen in which case before starting to read next lines people usually have to move a display window from a rightmost side of the file long distance back to a leftmost side of the file by pressing a left right key on a keyboard or a sliding bar on a touch screen of the mobile communication device.

The duplicating module may duplicate the leftmost part of the file and place it on the right of the rightmost side of the file. In an embodiment the duplicated leftmost part of the file may have a width at least as same as the display window.

The displaying module may display the file by moving the display window along a display frame. If the display frame is larger than the file then the display frame may contain the file and the duplicated leftmost part of the file. Examples of the display frame may be presented in which illustrate an embodiment of displaying the file in the condition that the display frame is larger than the file. Details of the will be provided in the following description. If the display frame is smaller than the file the display frame may contain either a part of the file or the rightmost part of the file with the duplicated leftmost part of the file which is placed on the right of the rightmost part.

Details of the will be provided in the following description.

The movement control module may detect if the display window moves to a rightmost side of the display frame and control the display window to automatically move to the leftmost side of the display frame. In an embodiment when generating the display frame the movement control module may calculate and save a position of a predefined rightmost boundary of the display frame. If the display window moves right and exceeds the boundary an automatic move back to the left mechanism may be triggered. Examples of the display window movements are presented in and 

In the above embodiments since the leftmost part of the file is duplicated and placed on the right of the rightmost side of the file and the display window automatically moves back to the leftmost side of the display frame when reaching the rightmost side of the display frame the user may be able to view the file without the need of manipulating the move back of the display window while feeling no disturbance of the display especially when the duplicated leftmost part of the file has the width at least as same as the display window.

It should be understood that other embodiments may implement other technologies for the apparatus . In an embodiment the duplicating module may leave a space or a mark between the rightmost part of the file and the duplicated leftmost part of the file on the display frame. In another embodiment in order to further improve the user experience when viewing the file especially if the file is made of word lines the duplicating module may move up the duplicated leftmost part of the file e.g. about one line space and then place it on the right of the rightmost side of the file as shown in . In yet another embodiment the duplicating module may duplicate the rightmost part of the file and place it on the left of the leftmost side of the file if the user is viewing the file through moving the display window from the right to the left.

In blocks and the movement control module or other devices may detect if the display window moves to the rightmost side of the display frame and if the user desires to continue viewing the file. If yes the movement control module may automatically move the display window to the leftmost side of the display frame so that the displaying module may continue displaying the file in circle through moving the display window in one direction e.g. in right direction under the user instructions on the keyboard or the touchscreen. In an embodiment when generating the display frame the movement control module may calculate and save the position of the predefined rightmost boundary of the display frame. If the display window moves right and exceeds the boundary an automatic move back to the left mechanism may be triggered. Examples of the display window movements are presented in and 

It should be understood that other embodiments may implement other technologies for the method. In an embodiment there may be a space or a mark between the rightmost part of the file and the duplicated leftmost part of the file on the display frame. In another embodiment in order to further improve the user experience when viewing the file especially if the file is made of word lines the duplicated leftmost part of the file may be moved up e.g. about one line space and then be placed to the right of the rightmost side of the file as shown in . In yet another embodiment the rightmost part of the file may be duplicated and placed on the left of the leftmost side of the file if the user is viewing the file through moving the display window from the right to the left.
