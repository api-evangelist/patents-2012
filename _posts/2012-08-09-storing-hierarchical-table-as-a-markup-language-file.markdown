Embodiments generally relate to computer systems and more particularly to methods and systems for storing hierarchical data.

Markup language files e.g. XML files are commonly used for distributing data in a rapid and reliable manner. Typically these markup language files also store the structure of the data along with the data to be transmitted. The structure of the data may be stored by organizing the elements of the markup language file according to the structure of the data. For example a markup language file may store a structure of a hierarchical structure by arranging parent elements and child elements of a hierarchical data such that child elements are contained in the related parent elements.

In certain cases the structure of the data to be transmitted may be complex. For example a hierarchical data having multiple levels of hierarchies has a complex structure. Transmitting and parsing markup language file storing such complex structure may be cumbersome and time consuming.

Embodiments of techniques for storing a hierarchical table as a markup language file are described herein. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components materials etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment this embodiment and similar phrases means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

In one embodiment the rows are included in a row dimension of the hierarchical table. Similarly the columns are included in a column dimension of the hierarchical table. A dimension is a line in a real or abstract space. An example of a real space dimension is a pair of antiparallel cardinal points on a compass e.g. North and South North northwest and South southeast. Another real dimension is time. An example of an abstract space dimension is a list of stores. Examples of dimensions include region store year customer employee product line and the like. In one embodiment each row of the hierarchical table may be one unit of the row dimension. Similarly each column of the hierarchical table may be one unit of the column dimension. In the above example the sales hierarchical table includes a row dimension and a column dimension. The row dimension includes the four rows of the sales hierarchical table. Each of the four rows in the sales hierarchical table represents one unit of the row dimension. Similarly the column dimension includes the four columns of the hierarchical table.

Initially at block the position of the cells in the hierarchical table may be identified. The position of a cell in the hierarchical table may be identified based on the row dimension and the column dimension of the hierarchical table. In one embodiment the unit of the row dimension and the unit of the column dimension corresponding to the cell together identify the position of the cell in the hierarchical table. In the above example row 1 and column 1 together identify the position of the first cell which is at the top left corner in the hierarchical table as the unit of the row dimension and the unit of the column dimension corresponding to the first cell is row 1 and column 1 respectively. Similarly the identified position of a second cell adjacent to the first cell in the first row is row 1 and column 2.

Next at block the position of the cells identified at block may be inserted in a markup language file. According to one embodiment a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. A markup language file may include markup tags which identify the data stored in the markup language file. The markup language file may also include markup attributes corresponding to markup tags which may store the data identified by the markup tag. As discussed above the position of a cell in a hierarchical table includes the unit of row dimension and the unit of column dimension corresponding to the cell. In one embodiment the unit of one of the dimensions row dimension or column dimension included in the position of cell may be inserted as a markup tag in the markup language file. Further the unit of the other dimension column dimension or row dimension included in the position of the cell may be inserted as a markup attribute corresponding to the markup tag. In the above example the unit of the row dimension row 1 included in the identified position of the first cell may be inserted as a first markup tag in the hierarchical table. Further the unit of the column dimension column 1 included in the position of the first cell may be inserted as a first markup attribute corresponding to the first markup tag. The markup tags and attributes inserted in the markup language file may together represent the position of the cells in the hierarchical table.

Finally at block the data included in the cells of the hierarchical table are stored in the markup attribute inserted at block of the markup language file. In the above example assume that the first cell of the sales hierarchical table stored the data sales table . The data sales table stored in the first cell may be stored in the first attribute inserted in the markup language file at block . A markup language file storing the hierarchical table may be obtained after the data in each cell of the hierarchical table is stored in the markup attributes inserted in the markup language file.

In one embodiment a parser may parse the markup language file to obtain the hierarchical table. As the markup language file stores the position and the data of each cell in the hierarchical table a parser may easily obtain the hierarchical table from the markup language file without any knowledge of the hierarchical information in the hierarchical table. Further since the position of the cells in the hierarchical table is inserted as markup tags and attributes in the markup language file the parser does not need knowledge about user defined tags and attribute names for parsing the markup language file. This may considerably reduce the time required by the parser for obtaining the hierarchical table from the markup language file.

For storing the hierarchical table as a markup language file initially at block the plurality of cells in the hierarchical table may be parsed. A cell is a unit of the table where a column and row of the table intersect. For example the 5 7 population hierarchical table has 35 cells as there are 35 intersections between the 5 rows and the 7 columns of the hierarchical table. In one embodiment parsing is the process of analyzing the cells of the hierarchical table to identify information related to the cells. The parsing of the cells in the hierarchical table may be performed one by one in a sequential order. In the population hierarchical table each of the 35 cells may be parsed to identify the information related to the 35 cells.

Next at block based on the parsing of the cells performed at block position of the cells in the hierarchical table may be identified. Position refers to the spatial location of an entity. In one embodiment the position of each cell in the hierarchical table may be identified with respect to the other cells in the hierarchical table. The identified position of each cell in the hierarchical table may be a combination of a first dimension coordinate and a second dimension coordinate of the cell. A first dimension of the hierarchical table may either be a row dimension or a column dimension of the hierarchical table. Similarly a second dimension of the hierarchical table may be a dimension column dimension or a row dimension other than the first dimension of the hierarchical table. In one embodiment the first dimension and the second dimension of the hierarchical table may be along one of the axes of a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. A typical Cartesian coordinate system specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates which are the distances of the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines measured in the same unit of length. A reference line may be referred to as a coordinate axis or an axis of the system. An axis is a reference line from which distances or angles are measured in a coordinate system. The axis may be the X axis which is a reference line in horizontal direction or a Y axis which is a reference line in vertical direction. The axis corresponding to the first dimension and the second dimension may be referred to as the first dimension axis and the second dimension axis respectively. In one embodiment identifying the position of the cells in the hierarchical table may include identifying the first dimension axis and the second dimension axis of the hierarchical table. In the above example assume that the row dimension is the first dimension and the column dimension is the second dimension of the population hierarchical table. As the first dimension row dimension of the population hierarchical table is in a horizontal direction the first dimension axis row dimension axis of the hierarchical table may be the X axis. Similarly as the second dimension column dimension of the population hierarchical table is in the vertical direction the second dimension axis column dimension axis may be the Y axis.

In one embodiment the first dimension coordinate and the second dimension coordinate of a cell is measured with respect to the first dimension axis and the second dimension axis respectively of the hierarchical table. A coordinate is a value that defines the position of a point line or the like with reference to a fixed figure system of lines etc. The reference for identifying the first dimension coordinate and the second dimension coordinate may be the first dimension axis and the second dimension axis respectively. In one embodiment the first dimension coordinate is a combination of the first dimension axis and a unique identifier that identifies the position of the cell with respect to the first dimension. For example if the first dimension is the row dimension then the unique identifier may be a row number of the unit of row dimension corresponding to the cell. Similarly the second dimension coordinate is a combination of the second dimension axis and a unique identifier that identifies the position of the cell with respect to a unit of the second dimension. In the above example the first dimension coordinate of the cell at the intersection of row 1 and column 1 in the population hierarchical table may be X1 which is a combination of the first dimension axis X and the unique identifier 1 that identifies the position of the first cell with respect to the first row dimension. In this case the unique identifier 1 is the row number of the unit of row dimension first row corresponding to the first cell. Similarly the second dimension coordinate of the first cell may be Y1 which is a combination of the second dimension axis Y and the unique identifier 1 that identifies the position of the first cell with respect to the second column dimension. The unique identifier is the column number of the unit of column dimension column 1 corresponding to the first cell.

In one embodiment the first dimension coordinate and the second dimension coordinate of the cell together represent the position of the cell in the hierarchical table. For example the first dimension coordinate and the second dimension coordinate X1 Y1 together identify the position of the first cell at the intersection of the first row and the first column of the population hierarchical table.

Next at block the first dimension coordinate is inserted as a markup tag in a markup language file. A markup language is used for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. Examples of markup language include extensible markup language XML hypertext markup language HTML etc. The markup language file may include markup tags which identify the data stored in the markup language file. In one embodiment the first dimension coordinate included in the identified position of the cell at block is inserted as a markup tag such as XML tag in the markup language file. Each markup tag in the hierarchical table may represent one unit of the first dimension of the hierarchical table. In the above example one unit of the first dimension coordinate X1 included in the identified position X1Y1 of the cell at the intersection of row 1 and column 1 in the population hierarchical table may be inserted as a markup tag in the markup language file. Five markup tags X1 X2 X3 X4 and X5 which are the first dimension coordinate corresponding to each unit of the row dimension may be inserted in the markup language file.

In one embodiment a first dimension axis corresponding to each unit of the first dimension may be inserted as a markup tag in the markup language file. In the above example five markup tags X X X X and X which are the first dimension axis corresponding to each unit of the first row dimension may be inserted in the markup language file.

Next at block the second dimension coordinate included in the position of the cell identified at block is inserted as a markup attribute in the markup language file. The markup attribute being inserted in the markup language file may be corresponding to the markup tag inserted in the markup language file at block . Markup attributes may be associated with the markup tag to further define the tags. In one embodiment the syntax of a markup tag and markup attributes corresponding to the markup tag may be . In one embodiment one markup attribute may be inserted in the markup language file for each cell of the hierarchical table. As the markup attributes inserted in the markup language file has a 1 1 relationship with the number of cells in the hierarchical table there is no duplication of markup tag names and markup attribute names of the markup attributes corresponding to the markup tags. In the above example the second column dimension coordinates included in the positions of the cells identified at block may be Y1 Y7 which is a combination of the column dimension axis Y axis and a unique identifier that identifies the unit of the column dimension corresponding to the cells. The second dimensions coordinates Y1 Y7 may be inserted as markup attributes in the markup language file. As the population hierarchical table includes thirty five cells thirty five markup attributes may be inserted in the markup language file corresponding to the thirty five cells in the population hierarchical table. The markup tags and the markup attributes inserted in the markup language file together identify the position of each cell in the hierarchical table. Table 2 illustrates the markup language file obtained after inserting the markup tags and the markup attributes corresponding to the cells in the population hierarchical table. Each of the tag attribute pair X1 Y1 X1 Y2 . . . in the table 2 is a position of a cell in the population hierarchical table.

In one embodiment the markup attributes may be inserted in the markup language file corresponding to only those cells of the hierarchical table that include data. In the above example for the first row of the population hierarchical table only two markup attributes Y4 and Y7 may be inserted in the markup language file as only the fourth cell and the seventh cell in the first row of the population hierarchical table store data. In this case the first line of the markup language may include . In one embodiment the markup language file storing the hierarchical table is a flat markup language file. A flat markup language file may include markup elements for storing the hierarchical table. Each markup element in the flat markup language file represents cells corresponding to a single unit of the first dimension. A markup element includes a markup tag and markup attributes corresponding to the markup tag for storing data. In the markup language file shown in table 2 each line of the markup language file is a markup element that includes markup tag and attributes representing position of the cells corresponding to one unit of the rows dimension first dimension . For example the first line is a markup element representing the position of the cells included in one unit first row of the row dimension corresponding to the population hierarchical table shown in Table 1.

Next at block the cells corresponding to the first dimension of the hierarchical table may be sequentially selected from the hierarchical table. The first dimension of the hierarchical table may be the row dimension or the column dimension of the hierarchical table. In one embodiment the first dimension may be the dimension corresponding to the first dimension coordinate that has been inserted as a markup tag in the markup language file at block . In one embodiment cells corresponding to one unit of the first dimension may be sequentially selected from the hierarchical table. In the above example the cells corresponding to each unit of the row dimension e.g. first dimension of the population hierarchical table may be selected one at a time. Initially the cells corresponding to the first row which is one unit of the first row dimension of the hierarchical table may be selected. Next the cells corresponding to the second row which is another unit of the first row dimension of the hierarchical table may be selected.

Next at block the data stored in the cells selected at block of the hierarchical table may be identified. In one embodiment the metadata of the data stored in the selected cells may also be identified along with the data. The metadata is data about data. Metadata may describe information about when or by whom a particular set of data was collected or whether data can be edited or any other additional information related to the data. In the above example the data identified for the selected cells in the first row of the population hierarchical table is EUROPE and USA . The metadata related to the data EUROPE is which indicates that the data EUROPE can be expanded and the metadata for the data USA is which indicates that the data USA can be collapsed.

In one embodiment the hierarchical information of the selected cells may also be identified. Hierarchical information may include information related to the different parent child relationships in the hierarchical table. In the above example the hierarchical information related to the cells 5 and 6 in row 2 of the population hierarchical table which stores GERMANY and FRANCE may be that cells 5 and 6 in row 2 are child of the cell 4 in row 1 which stores the data EUROPE .

Finally at block the data identified at block included in the selected cells of the hierarchical table may be stored in the markup attributes inserted in the markup language file at block . In one embodiment the identified data and metadata of a selected cell may be stored in the inserted markup attribute which is the second dimension coordinate of the selected cell corresponding to the selected cell of the hierarchical table. The data and the metadata of the cell stored in the markup attribute may be separated by a delimiter for example a . In the above example the first line of the markup language file after storing the data and metadata of the selected cells of the first row may include where E and C represent the metadata expand and collapse respectively corresponding to the data EUROPE and USA included in the fourth cell and the seventh cell respectively of the hierarchical table. Table 3 illustrates the markup language file obtained after storing the data and metadata of all the cells in the hierarchical table in the markup attributes of the markup language file. The markup language file shown in Table 3 stores the hierarchical table shown in Table 1 in a two dimensional representation and does not require the markup language file to use hierarchical structure to store the structure of hierarchical table shown in Table 1.

In another embodiment the hierarchical information related to the selected cells of the hierarchical table may also be stored in the markup attribute along with the data and the metadata stored in the markup attributes. In this case the hierarchical information of the hierarchical table may not be stored by organizing the structure of the markup language file in the hierarchical order of the table. Rather the hierarchical information is concatenated with the data and the metadata of the cell and stored in the markup attribute corresponding to the cell. In one embodiment the hierarchical information parent child relationship of the hierarchical table may be stored by storing attributes names of the parent attribute storing parent data in the child attribute storing child data. In the above example the hierarchical information of the selected cells in the markup language file may be that data EUROPE stored in cell 4 of the first row is a parent of the data GERMANY and FRANCE stored in cells 5 and 6 of the second row in the hierarchical table. In this case the attribute name Y4 of the attribute storing parent data EUROPE may be stored in the attributes Y5 and Y6 of the markup language file storing the child data GERMANY and FRANCE . In this case the first line of the markup language file may include . A parser parsing this line of the markup language file will understand that the data stored in the markup attributes Y5 and Y6 are child elements of the data stored in the markup attribute Y4 and therefore has to be placed in the fifth and sixth cell of the second row in the hierarchical table.

In the above example the first line of the markup language file shown in table 3 may be parsed to identify the position for placing data stored in the markup attribute Y1 corresponding to markup tag X1. Based on the parsing the first cell of the hierarchical table having dimension coordinates X1 Y1 is identified as the position for placing the data .

As discussed above the first dimension axis may also be inserted as a markup tag in the markup language file. In this case the markup language parser may identify the first dimension coordinate of the cell positions in the hierarchical table based on the parsing count of the parser. As discussed above the markup language parser parses one line at a time. Therefore the parsing count of the parser may be incremented by 1 for each line in the markup language file. The markup language file may identify the first dimension coordinate of the cell positions in the hierarchical table based on the first dimension axis inserted as markup tag in the markup language file and the parsing count of the parser. For example consider a hierarchical table that has a first dimension axis as the X axis. The parser may initially parse the first line of the markup language file that may include . The parser may then identify the first dimension coordinate of the cell positions represented by the markup tag X as X1 based on the first dimension axis X and the parsing count of the parser which is 1. Similarly the markup language parser may identify the first dimension coordinate for the cells represented by the attributes in the second line of the markup language file as X2 because the first dimension axis inserted as markup tag in the markup language file is X and the parsing count of the parser is 2.

Finally at block the data stored in the markup attribute included in the markup language file may be placed at the positions determined at block of the hierarchical table. In the above example the data stored in the markup attribute Y1 may be stored at the position X1Y1 of the hierarchical table. Similarly the parser may determine the positions in the hierarchical table to place the other data items stored in the markup attributes inserted in the markup language file to obtain the hierarchical table. As the parser does not require any hierarchical information parent child relationship of the hierarchical table during the parsing it is able to quickly parse the markup language file to obtain the hierarchical table.

In another embodiment the parser may determine the hierarchical information stored in the markup attributes along with the data and the metadata stored in the markup attribute and obtain the hierarchical table based on the hierarchical information stored in the markup language file. In the above example the parser may parse the first line of the hierarchical table that includes to identify that the data GERMANY and FRANCE stored at attributes Y5 and Y6 respectively are children of the data EUROPE stored in the attribute Y4 which is the parent. In this case the parser may position the children data GERMANY and FRANCE at positions having a first dimension coordinates as X2 instead of X1 to show the hierarchical parent child relationship between the children data GERMANY and FRANCE and the parent data EUROPE which is stored at a position X1 Y4 having a first dimension coordinate as X1.

Initially for storing the hierarchical table as a markup language file the 54 cells of the hierarchical table may be parsed one by one to identify the first dimension coordinate and the second dimension coordinate of each of the 54 cells in the hierarchical table. In this case the row dimension and the column dimension are assumed to be the first dimension and the second dimension respectively of the hierarchical table . The row dimension of the hierarchical table is along the X axis. Therefore the X axis is the first dimension axis of the hierarchical table . Similarly the column dimension of the hierarchical table is along the Y axis which is the second dimension axis of the hierarchical table . The first dimension coordinate row dimension coordinate and the second dimension coordinate column dimension coordinate of each of the cell in the hierarchical table may be determined with reference to the X axis and the Y axis respectively.
