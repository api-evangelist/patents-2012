title: Antibiotic-bound poly(caprolactone) polymer
abstract: This invention is the design and synthesis of a caprolactone monomer which bears a pendant protected carboxyl group. This monomer has been copolymerized with caprolactone in varying ratios. After polymerization, the protecting group can be removed and an antibiotic can be attached as a new pendant group. The bioactivity of the antibiotic-bound poly(caprolactone) polymer is described.

The delivery of water insoluble drugs to targets within the human body is a challenge that presently places strict limitations on what drugs can be applied clinically. The need for methods which overcome this is of high priority in the development of new therapeutics for treatment of human disease.

The development of antibiotics for control of pathogenic bacteria has been of pressing need in this era of drug resistant infections. N Methylthiolated b lactams have been identified as a new family of antibacterial agents active against bacteria including methicillin resistant MRSA . See Turos E. Konaklieva M. I. Ren R. X. F. Shi H. Gonzalez J. Dickey S. Lim D. 2000 56 5571 Bart Heldreth Timothy E. Long Seyoung Jang Suresh K. R. Guntireddygari Edward Turos Sonja Dickey Daniel V. Lim N Thiolated b Lactam Antibacterials Effects of the N Organothio Substituent on anti MRSA Activity 14 3775 3784 2006 and Edward Turos Jeung Yeop Shim Yang Wang Kerriann Greenhalgh G. Suresh Kumar Reddy Sonja Dickey Daniel V. Lim Antibiotic Conjugated Polyacrylate Nanoparticles New Opportunities for Development of Anti MRSA Agents Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 16 in press 2006 which are incorporated herein by reference .

The compounds have also displayed promising anticancer properties. These lactams exert their growth inhibitory effects on bacteria through a mode of action that is distinctively different to that of other b lactam antibiotics and possess structure activity patterns unlike those already mapped for other b lactam antibacterials such as the penicillins. One of the major limitations in the potential application of these N thiolated b lactam compounds however is their exceedingly low water solubility.

Drug delivery vehicles such as liposomes and gold nanoparticles have been developed to improve bioavailability efficacy and specificity of pharmaceutical compounds particularly for anticancer agents but nanoparticles have received surprisingly little attention in the antibiotic and infectious disease area. Some of the few notable examples have included antibiotic encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes biodegradable nanospheres and surface coated gold and silver nanoparticles.

In one embodiment the invention provides an effective drug delivery platform that would enhance the water solubility of the lactams without sacrificing inherent bioactivity.

In another embodiment the invention provides for the development of antibacterial polyacrylate nanoparticles based on well precedented emulsion polymerization procedures.

This invention addresses this need and demonstrates the use of antibiotic bound poly caprolactone polymers as anti infective materials for biomedical applications in the prevention of bacterial infections.

In a first embodiment the invention includes a functionalized compound comprising at least one caprolactone ring with an appended functional group. A plurality of methylene groups act as a spacer between the lactone ring and the functional group. In a preferred embodiment the functional group is an antibiotic such as a N thiolated lactam. The functional group is preferably covalently bonded.

In an alternate embodiment a method is provided for producing the functionalized compound of the previous embodiment. The method includes providing a at least one caprolactone ring with a protecting group spaced apart from the caprolactone ring by a plurality of methylene groups. The protecting group is then cleaved from the caprolactone ring and replaced by bonding a functional group to the caprolactone ring. Illustrative reagents for cleaving the protecting group include 10 pd C as a catalyst in the presence of Hand ethyl acetate EtOAc . The protecting group is selected from the group consisting of alcohol protecting groups amine protecting groups carbonyl protecting groups and carboxyl protecting groups. In a preferred embodiment the protecting group is selected fro the group consisting of a benzel ester and a tert butyl ester. As with the previous embodiment the functional group is an antibiotic such as a N thiolated lactam.

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.

New family of anti MRSA and anti Bacillus agents that have recently been reported by our laboratory. Extensive SAR studies have shown that changing the N thioalkyl substituent has a large effect on the bioactivity and that changes at the other positions of the ring exert a more subtle effect. Recent research in our group has been focused on covalent attachment of these and other antibiotics to polymers for drug delivery and for new biomaterials.

As used herein the term drug to any therapeutic or prophylactic agent other than food which is used in the prevention diagnosis alleviation treatment or cure of disease in man or animal.

As used herein the term antibiotic refers to any natural synthetic and semi synthetic compound that has been identified as possessing antibacterial antifungal antiviral or antiparasitic activity.

Polycaprolactone PCL is a biodegradable polyester which can be prepared by ring opening polymerization of caprolactone using a catalyst such as stannous octanoate as shown in . PCL is degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions such as in the human body and is therefore useful as a biomaterial. PCL has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration FDA for use in the human body as for example a suture sold under the brand name Monocryl or generically . In particular PCL has been used in long term implantable devices owing to its degradation which is relatively slow. See V. R. Sinha K. Bansal R. Kaushik R. Kumria and A. Trehan Poly caprolactone microspheres and nanospheres an overview Volume 278 Issue 1 18 Jun. 2004 Pages 1 23 which is incorporated herein by reference.
