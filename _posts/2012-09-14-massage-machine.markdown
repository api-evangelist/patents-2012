This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Serial No. 2011 221460 filed Oct. 6 2011 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a massage machine suitable for rocking a chair main body in a forward backward direction.

Conventionally a massage machine has been known in which a movable frame and a fixed frame are coupled to each other a seat portion and a backrest portion are attached to the moveable frame and a pivot point is set at a fulcrum Such a massage machine is capable of rocking the movable frame in the forward backward direction about the pivot point with respect to the fixed frame by driving a rocking drive unit with a motor see FIGS. 4 and 5 in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011 72595 for example .

In addition another massage machine has also been known in which a supported portion and a base portion are coupled to each other with two front and back links a seat portion and a backrest portion are attached to the supported portion and which is capable of rocking the supported portion in the forward backward direction with respect to the base portion see FIG. 14 in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11 137626 for example .

According to the massage machine disclosed in JP 2011 72595 however a movable frame 11 chair main body is supported by a fixed frame 10 base while only a pivot point A2 is set to a movable portion and therefore the load of a user is concentrated and acts on the movable portion. Therefore excessive load acts on the rocking mechanism portion and there is a problem in that smooth rocking motion of the movable frame is prevented when the movable frame is rocked.

On the other hand in the massage machine disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 11 13762 since both front and back ends of a supported portion 56 chair main body are coupled to a base portion 5 base with two links 54 and 54 the load of a user acts on the movable portion coupling portions 55 and 55 between the supported portion and the base portion of the supported portion 56 with respect to the base 5 and is distributed in the forward backward direction. Therefore less load acts on the rocking mechanism portion during the rocking of the supported portion 56 and it is possible to smoothly rock the supported portion 56.

However since the massage machine disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 11 137626 is configured such that a lower end of the link 54 is coupled to the supported portion 56 chair main body and an upper end of the link 54 is coupled to the base portion 5 base it is necessary to locate the coupling portion to the link 54 in the base portion 5 at a higher position than a floor surface and there is a problem in that the height of entire massage machine becomes larger.

Thus the present invention has been made in order to solve the aforementioned problems and an object thereof is to provide a massage machine which is capable of stably rocking a chair main body in the forward backward direction the overall height of which is suppressed.

According to the present invention there is provided a massage machine including a chair main body including a seat portion on which a user is seated and a back rest portion which is provided behind the seat portion a base which supports the chair main body a massage portion which is provided in the chair main body to perform massage on a body of the user and a rocking mechanism portion which rocks the chair main body in a forward backward direction with respect to the base wherein the rocking mechanism portion includes link members each of which has a lower portion pivotally supported by the base and an upper portion pivotally supported by the chair main body wherein each link member includes a first link portion and a second link portion positioned behind the first link portion and wherein the chair main body is rocked in the forward backward direction by rocking the upper portions of the link members in the forward backward direction. With such a configuration the chair main body is supported by the base via the first and second link portions provided in the forward backward direction and therefore it is possible to distribute the load working on the rocking mechanism portion in the forward backward direction and thereby to stably rock the chair main body in the forward backward direction. In addition since the lower portions of the link members are coupled to the base and the upper portions of the link members are coupled to the chair main body it is not necessary to locate the coupling portions of the link members in the base at a position which is higher than the floor surface and it is possible to suppress a height of the entire massage machine.

In addition it is preferable that the chair main body include an accommodating portion which accommodates at least a part of the rocking mechanism portion inside the chair main body to which the link members are attached. With such a configuration fewer parts of the rocking mechanism portion are exposed outside of the chair main body and it is possible to enhance aesthetic appearance.

In addition it is preferable that the rocking drive unit include a motor a decelerator whose output shaft is rotated by rotation of the motor and a converter which converts rotational movement of the output shaft into reciprocating rocking motion in the forward backward direction of the link members and that the converter include a rotational member which is rotatable integrally with the output shaft an eccentric shaft which is attached to the rotational member and a crank member which is provided between the eccentric shaft and the base. With such a configuration it is possible to sequentially reciprocate and rock the chair main body in the forward backward direction by sequentially rotating the motor in one direction.

In addition it is preferable that the chair main body include a footrest which is provided in front of the seat portion such that the footrest is turnable in the vertical direction that the chair main body be configured such that a front portion of the seat portion moves upward in accordance with forward movement and a front portion of the seat portion moves downward in accordance with backward movement and that the footrest be configured to be turned upward in accordance with the forward movement of the chair main body. With such a configuration the legs are stretched as they move to a higher position and therefore it is possible to promote the blood flow in the legs to be directed to the heart as in a so called centripetal method and thereby to enhance a relaxing effect.

In addition it is preferable that the massage machine further include foot link members which vertically turn the footrest in accordance with movement of the chair main body in the forward backward direction and that the footrest be connected to the link members via the foot link members. With such a configuration it is not necessary to separately provide a drive source for vertically turning the footrest.

In addition it is preferable that a configuration be made such that the first link portions are coupled to the rocking drive portion and the second link portions follow operations of the first link portions and that the foot link members be pivotally supported by the first link portions. With such a configuration the load from the legs acts on the footrest the drive force of the rocking drive unit is directly delivered to the first link portions since the rocking drive unit is coupled to the first link portions to which the foot link members are coupled and it is possible to smoothly rock the chair main body in the forward and backward direction and turn the footrest in the vertical direction.

In addition one end of the crank member is rotationally attached to the eccentric shaft and the other end thereof is rotationally attached to the third shaft . Moreover the output shaft is provided so as to extend in the horizontal direction and the first link portions and are coupled to each other at both left and right ends thereof.

According to such a configuration of the converters the output shaft of the decelerator and the rotational member sequentially rotate in one direction when the motor sequentially rotates in one direction. In so doing the eccentric shaft on the rotational member performs circular motion about the rotation center C and the crank member converts the circular motion into reciprocation of the link member in the forward backward direction. That is the converters configure a reciprocation crank mechanism and it is possible to sequentially and forcibly reciprocate and rock the chair main body in the forward backward direction while an angle of a seating face of the seat portion is changed by causing the motor to sequentially rotate in one direction. Such converters are provided as a pair on the left and right sides which makes it possible to stably rock the chair main body .

As shown in the rocking drive unit is attached to the link members . Specifically the motor and the decelerator are attached to a first link portion on any one side of the left and right sides the right side in this embodiment and configured to move along with the first link portion . The converters are respectively attached to each of the pair of first link portion . A plurality of three in this embodiment detected objects made of magnetic or the like are provided at the output shaft of the decelerator and a detector made of a Hall IC or the like which detects a rotation position of the output shaft by detecting the positions of the detected objects is provided at a cover member not shown covering the decelerator .

The position detecting sensor is electrically connected to the control unit and the control unit is configured to control the drive of the motor in accordance with a detection result of the position detecting sensor .

According to this embodiment it is possible to detect a standing state a state shown in in which the chair main body is in a most standing state a reclining state a state shown in in which the chair main body is in the most reclined state and an intermediate state a state shown in in which the chair main body is positioned between the standing state and the reclining state as shown in by detecting the positions of the three detected objects . In addition the state of the chair main body is sequentially changed between the standing state and the reclining state via the intermediate state by sequentially driving the motor in one direction and the chair main body is positioned at an arbitrary position between the standing state and the reclining state by stopping the motor .

In addition as shown in the aforementioned rocking drive unit motor and the massage portions to can be operated based on a signal input to the control unit by the person to be treated controlling a remote controller connected to the control unit as well as based on a program preset in accordance with an instruction from the control unit .

As shown in each of the foot link members includes a first foot link portion which is pivotally supported by the chair main body via the bracket a second foot link portion which is pivotally supported by the first link portion and the first foot link portion and a third foot link portion which is pivotally supported by the second foot link portion and the bracket . The upper portion of the first foot link portion is attached to the bracket namely the seat portion via a pivot A between the pivots A and A and the lower portion thereof is attached to the back portion of the second foot link portion via a pivot A. The front portion of the second fool link portion is attached to the third foot link portion via a pivot A and attached to the first link portion via a pivot A between the pivots A and A. The upper portion of the third fool link portion is attached to the bracket namely the footrest via a pivot A and the lower portion thereof is attached to the second foot link portion via the pivot A.

When the first link portions are rocked forward about the first shaft and made to approach the reclining state from the standing state the first foot link portions are rocked in the back direction about the pivot A the front portion of the second foot link portion is rocked upward about the pivot A with respect to the first link portion and the third foot link portion is rocked downward about the pivot A. Therefore when the chair main body is rocked forward and made to approach the reclining state the footrest is turned upward. More specifically the seat portion is reclined and the footrest is elevated in the course in which the chair main body is shifted from the standing state to the reclining state. On this occasion the legs are stretched as they move to a higher position and therefore it is possible to promote blood flow to be directed from toes to the heart as in a so called centripetal method and thereby to enhance a relaxing effect.

On the other hand when the first link portions is rocked backward about the first shaft and made to approach the standing state from the reclining state the first foot link portion is rocked to the front direction about the pivot A the front portion of the second foot link portion is rocked downward about the pivot A with respect to the first link portion and the third foot link portion is rocked upward about the pivot A. Therefore when the chair main body is rocked backward and made to approach the standing state the footrest is turned downward. Since the footrest is lowered when the chair main body is in the standing state the user can easily sit down on and stand up from the chair main body .

Hereinafter description will be given of a massage machine according to a second embodiment of the present invention with reference to the and .

Each rocking drive unit is configured by a direct acting type actuator including a motor a cylinder which is driven by the motor to extend and contract. In the rocking drive unit the base portion is attached in a turnable manner by the third shaft pivot of the base and the leading end is attached to the first link portion link member in a rotatable manner by a pivot . With such a configuration it is possible to rock the link members forward as shown by a one dotted chain line and shift the chair main body to the reclining state when the rocking drive unit is elongated and it is possible to rock the link members backward as shown by a solid line and shift the chair main body to the standing state when the rocking drive unit is shortened.

The rocking drive unit includes a position detecting sensor which detects the rocking position of the chair main body with respect to the base . The position detecting sensor is configured by detected objects made of a magnet or the like which are attached to an output shaft of the motor and detectors made of Hall ICs or the like which are provided at a motor main body for detecting the passing of the detected objects so as to be able to detect an arbitrary rocking position between the standing state and the reclining state of the chair main body by the detectors detecting the number of rotations of the output shaft motor . Moreover two detectors are provided so as to be adjacent to each other in a circumferential direction of the output shaft and can also detect the rotation direction of the output shaft motor by determining which detector has detected the passing of the detected object earlier. The position detecting sensor is electrically connected to the control unit and the control unit is configured to control the drive of the motor in accordance with a detection result of the position detecting sensor .

In addition the massage machine of the present invention is not limited to the configurations shown in the drawings and other configurations are also applicable within the scope of the present invention. For example a biasing member made of a spring tension spring a damper or the like may be provided which is attached between the base and the first link portion link member instead of the rocking drive unit or so as to bias the chair main body to the standing state in the rocking mechanism portion. In such a case the chair main body can be maintained in the standing state by the biasing force of the biasing member and the backrest portion can be brought to be in the reclining state when the user seated on the seat portion leans on the backrest portion . Then when the user weakens the force of leaning on the backrest portion the backrest portion in the reclining state can be recovered to the standing state by the biasing force of the biasing member.
