title: Selectable fragment size fragmentation warhead
abstract: A fragmenting warhead is provided having an outer cylindrically shaped hollow steel shell which can be selectively detonated into different fragment types and sizes. The warhead has a plastic liner within said shell, and a core of explosive. There are a number of insulated wire grids of high electrical resistance which will heat when an electrical current is provided thereto located in intimate thermal contact with the explosive, each grid corresponding to a fragment type and size for selection by providing electrical current to that selected grid. Heat flux is caused when an electrical current runs through a particular grid and this selectively melts explosive in the near vicinity of such grid, then a detonation of the explosive core will result in a fragmentation type and pattern corresponding to that grid type and pattern. An ignition propellant train may also be selectively associated with wires on the grids to further selectively detonate the explosive. The plastic liner serves not only as electrical insulation, but also increases grid structural integrity, ease of manufacturing, thermal insulation, and IM qualities of the warhead.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 563 474 filed on Sep. 21 2009 now abandoned the entire file contents of which application are hereby incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth.

The inventions described herein may be made used or licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Warhead fragmentation effectiveness is determined by the number mass shape and velocity of the warhead s fragments. By using a controlled fragmentation design warhead fragmentation can generally be achieved quickly and in a cost effective manner. Exemplary controlled fragmentation techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 491 694 4 312 274 4 745 864 5 131 329 and 5 337 673. Further U.S. Pat. No. 3 877 376 issued Apr. 15 1975 to Vahey Kupelian and U.S. Pat. No. 4 516 501 issued May 14 1985 to Held et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 544 589 issued Aug. 13 1996 to Manfred Held U.S. Pat. No. 3 799 054 to Edward W. La Rocca are also all hereby incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth at length.

Conventional designs in general use cutter liners that form fragments by generating a complex pattern of high velocity penetrators for fragmenting the shell. Although these conventional fragmentation designs have proven to be useful it would be desirable to present additional functional cost and safety improvements that minimize the warhead weight reduce manufacture expenses and advance current United States Insensitive Munition IM requirements.

What is needed in this art and heretofore unavailable is an explosive fragmentation ammunition with target adaptable fragmentation output and more particularly to a warhead having means for selectively controlling the size and shapes of fragments produced. According to an embodiment of this invention controlling the size of fragments is accomplished through a pattern of grids of high electrical resistance metal wires comprising two or more separate electric circuits each corresponding to the fragment sizes and shapes desired.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a fragmenting warhead shell with means to selectively control fragment sizes and 

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fragmenting warhead shell with means to selectively melt a pattern of explosive to produce a relatively small size fragment or a relatively large size fragments in the fragmenting shell and 

It is a still further object of the present invention to selectively melt and then lead away excessive molten explosive by vacuum into chambers in a plastic liner through side vents to selectively melt a pattern of explosive to produce a relatively small size fragment or relatively large size fragments in the fragmenting shell and 

It is a yet another object of the present invention to selectively ignite a propellant train associated with wires on a grid to detonate a main explosive charge which will lead to relatively small size fragment or relatively large size fragments in the fragmenting shell.

These and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in view of the within detailed descriptions of the invention and in light of the following drawings not necessarily drawn to scale size in which 

According to another embodiment of the invention in the plastic liner may be provided with a series of vents facilitating evacuation of molten explosive into plastic liner cavity reservoirs or chambers . To evacuate liquid explosive phase molten explosive into any vents reservoirs or chambers the plastic liner should be under negative pressure e.g. under a vacuum by a vacuum creating means details not shown .

According to yet further embodiment of the invention in heat flux from a high electrical resistance wire formed in patterns of wire grid s such as and or some combination of both not completely shown here initiates an igniter and igniter then starts the explosive burning or some form of propellant in certain other embodiments . Under these conditions of confinement propellant deflagration will transition into a detonation that will initiate a main explosive charge . The collision of the detonation waves will generate a Mach Stem like pattern of high pressure regions ultimately replicating stamping patterns like the wire grid s with the desired fragment sizes onto the fragmenting shell .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
