This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 680 834 filed Aug. 8 2012 which is herein incorporated by reference

The embodiments herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.

Magnetic storage has a limited storage lifetime bit density and volatility. The magnetic medium used in traditional disk storage degrades within a decade. The information is stored in small magnetic bit regions through magnetizing each region in a particular direction. Over time the magnetization of the bit regions is corrupted by external electromagnetic forces or through prolonged exposure to the Earth s magnetic field or by thermal upsets. Thermal upsets are statistical processes that occur when the magnetization of a bit is thermally activated to overcome the anisotropy barrier.

As electronic recording evolves and more information is digitized there exists not just a critical necessity for storage volume but also increased storage permanency. A need exists for high density stable non volatile memory with a longer storage life and less potential to be corrupted by external influences.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a system for storing information in a nonvolatile memory comprising a substrate having a magnetic material operatively associated therewith the magnetic material having at least one first portion of low permeability and at least one second portion of high permeability a reader comprising a sensor for reading information by measuring the magnetic permeability for the at least one first portion and the at least one second portion whereby the information contained in at least one first portion and the at least one second portion are not affected by sources of external magnetic energy.

Optionally the system may comprise a spin torque oscillator STO reader which measures the magnetic permeability of the first and second portions by subjecting them to a magnetic field The magnetic field can be an external field i.e. an external probe field and or a magnetic field from the STO. The first and second portions may modify the magnetic field at the position of the STO sensor. The magnetic field at the position of the STO sensor determines the frequency Q and or amplitude of the microwave radiation. Thus measuring the microwave radiation emitted from the STO determines the magnetic permeability of the first and second portions. Optionally when the at least one first or second portion are subjected to the magnetic field they modify the magnetic field at the position of the sensor which in turn determines the properties of the microwave radiation namely the frequency Q and amplitude. The resultant radiation is compared to a reference frequency to determine whether the shift in frequency is sufficient to indicate whether the at least one first or second portion has low permeability or high permeability. Optionally the resultant radiation is compared to a reference frequency using a mixer and comparator and the frequency of the STO microwave radiation is changed when the STO microwave radiation is effected by the magnetic field change caused by the permeability of at least one first or second portion. The at least one first portion of low permeability may be created by heating the magnetic material with a laser hot tip or ohmic heating such that the atomic structure is changed.

Optionally an alternative system reader may comprise a magnetoresistive sensor for example a Magnetic Tunnel Junction MTJ reader which measures the change in resistance in a magnetic field. In this case one measures the resistance change occurring when the sensor passes in close proximity to the at least one first and second portions.

A method of reading information from a magnetic medium based upon the magnetic permeability based upon the principles of the present invention comprises 

aligning a sensor in close proximity to the medium comprising at least one portion of low permeability and at least one portion of high permeability 

measuring the response of the reader when the sensor is in close proximity to the at least one portion of high permeability the at least one portion of high permeability operating to change the microwave frequency outputted from the reader by more than a predetermined threshold value comparing the response to a own reference value and outputting the information shred in the magnetic medium.

Optionally the method may utilize a change in the microwave frequency outputted from the reader above a predetermined threshold value when the sensor is in close proximity to determine the permeability.

Alternately the method may utilize a change in the voltage measured when a magnetoresistive sensor for example a magnetic tunnel junction reader with a constant current flowing through it is in close proximity to the at least one portion of low permeability. The measurement of voltage ma be compared to a known reference voltage to determine whether the sensor is in close proximity to either a first portion of low permeability or a second portion of high permeability.

Optionally the method may utilize a reader further comprising at least one permanent magnet or electromagnet positioned in proximity to the sensor that allows the reader to operate in a magnetic field region that maximizes its sensitivity and or optimizes performance.

Optionally the method may utilize a magnetoresistive reader and the response of the magnetoresistive reader may be inputted into a difference analyzer for comparing the measurement of voltage to a known predetermined voltage.

Optionally the method may utilize as a reader a spin torque oscillator that radiates an RF signal which is effected by the first portion or second portion to be measured and wherein a frequency shift is observed and wherein the effected signal is inputted into a mixer which measures the frequency shift by comparing the frequency of the effected signal with a known reference frequency to determine a difference value which indicates whether the spin torque oscillator is in close proximity to either a first portion of low permeability or a second portion of high permeability and wherein either a 1 or 0 bit is outputted according to the mixer output. Optionally the mixer output may be further inputted into a comparator which compares the difference value to a predetermined frequency shift 

An alternate embodiment for storing information in a nonvolatile memory comprises a medium comprising magnetic material having at least one first portion of low permeability and at least one second portion of high permeability the portions of low permeability being formed in the medium by heating the portions such as for example by using a laser with a hot tip or by ohmic heating.

A preferred methodology for reading media in a non erasable or nonvolatile memory technology is based on bits of high and low magnetic permeability. Since the permeability is an intrinsic property this technology can potentially encode information at higher densities and with longer retention times than present magnetic storage based on spin domains. To illustrate the preferred embodiment technique 10 micron wide magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs are used to read approximate 10 micron wide lines with approximate 50 micron separation of a soft magnetic material permalloy deposited on low permeability glass as depicted in . The dimensions may be modified without departing from the scope of the present invention. A magnetic probe field is unaffected by the glass but is shunted away from the MTJs by the higher permeability permalloy lines. The difference in field sensed by the MTJs has a signal to noise ratio of 45 dB that persists at different scan rates and even after the lines are exposed to fields of 6400 Oe. The information density is expected to be able to be increased by decreasing the size of the magnetic tunnel junctions.

Current magnetic memory technology that manipulates an extrinsic property of magnetic media e.g. the direction of magnetization as shown in to encode information has two major disadvantages for data storage. First since the information is written by applying a magnetic field to switch the spin direction the information can also be erased by exposure to an inadvertent magnetic field. Secondly the density and lifetime of the bits are restricted by the need to preserve thermal stability of the magnetic domains. Thermal stability of the domains is constrained by the superparamagnetic limit as described in greater detail in Y. Zhimin et al. in Magnetic Recording Conference 2009. APMRC 09. Asia Pacific. 2009 and R. F. L. Evans Applied Physics Letters 2012. 100 10 p. 102402 3. For example to reliably store information at room temperature for 7 years domain sizes above 5 50 nm are required to satisfy the N el Arrhenius relation KV kT 50 where V is the volume of the bit Kis the crystalline anisotropy kis the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. Alternative methods of information storage do not presently possess the density of magnetic memory and generally do not retain information indefinitely. Thus each year billions of dollars worldwide must be spent duplicating huge amounts of data to prevent corruption by thermal upsets or accidental exposure to magnetic fields. To improve the ability to store information a preferred embodiment technology stores information by using an intrinsic property of soft ferromagnetic materials the magnetic permeability. The presence of high low permeability material modifies does not affect an external probe magnetic field. Any magnetic field modification is detected by a reader in close proximity to the media which consists of regions of different permeability as described in greater detail in U.S. Published Application No. 2008 0102320 by A. S. Edelstein and G. A. Fischer entitled Non Erasable Magnetic Identification Media hereby incorporated by reference. The media is non erasable as the magnetization of a soft ferromagnet returns to its original demagnetized state when the probe magnetic field is removed. Since the magnetic permeability is an intrinsic property dependent on the atomic arrangement of the media it is insensitive to external influences e.g. electromagnetic radiation and temperature and should maintain an indefinitely long retention time under typical environmental conditions. Furthermore there is no theoretical limit on the density that is equivalent to the restriction of the superparamagnetic limit. The limitation instead is the practical requirement of finding an economical method for reading and writing the information.

In accordance with the principles of the invention a preferred embodiment system comprises a soft magnetic media with a series of magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs acting as the reader. See for example . In contrast to present magnetic memory technology in which the media provides the field detected by the reader our technology decouples the process. Instead in general in a preferred embodiment an external magnet or coil provides a probe magnetic field and the soft magnetic media modifies this field. Thus for optimization the magnetic field and media can be separately selected to optimize performance. Different widths of high permeability permalloy lines which may for example be 0.434 microns thick and 2500 microns long may be sputtered onto a 1200 micron thick optical grade soda lime substrate of low permeability 1 or other low permeability substrate. These lines consist of six alternating layers of 70 nm permalloy NiFe and 2.25 nm Cr. The layers can be sputtered in a magnetron sputtering system with a working Ar gas pressure under 10 mtorr and a bias of 100 Vat the substrate. These conditions reduce intrinsic stress in the thin film and result in low coercivities 0.1 Oe and high permeabilities 1000 . E beam lithography was employed to pattern the lines on the glass. The experimental setup for reading is shown in . A probe field is either unchanged by the glass or modified by the permeability of the permalloy . The modified field in is read as either a 0 or 1 bit by the MTJs in the reader . As depicted in the permalloy bits shunt some of the field into the permalloy. Depending upon the geometry this can either increase or decrease the field at the position of the reader Shown in is the case in which the detected field is decreased in magnitude at the 1 position. The reader is placed on the movable stage of a microscope which may be for example a VHX 1000 Keyence. A permanent magnet attached to the moveable stage provides a probe field oriented along the sense direction of the MTJs in the reader. The media comprising glass is held parallel to the plane of the reader and is located between it and the lens of the microscope. The separation between the media and the reader defined as the fly height can be varied between 0 and 100 microns. A schematic view of the media and reader as seen through the microscope at a magnification of 500 is shown in . At a constant fly height the moveable stage was used to manually translate the reader under the stationary media. The preferred embodiment method of measurement has the advantage that one can visually correlate positions of the reader and media to changes in the detected field due to the media s permeability.

The changes in field were determined by the tunneling magnetoresistance TMR in the MTJs at a constant current of 1 mA and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. There are 10 serially connected 40 10 micron MTJ ellipses in the reader. The magnetic sense direction of these MTJs is perpendicular to their major axis which is in the same direction as the MTJ chain. MTJ stacks were deposited onto a thermally oxidized silicon substrate in a magnetron sputtering system with a base pressure below 1 microtorr. Each MTJ shown in comprised nm thick layers of Ta 5 Ru 20 IrMn 5 CoFe 4 Ru 0.8 CoFeB 3.5 MgO 2 CoFeB 1.8 NiFeCuMo 50 Cu 10 . The two layers immediately above the MgO insulator comprise the free layer and electrode . There are three layers not shown below fixed layer that constitute the synthetic antiferromagnetic SAF reference layer that is used to pin the direction of the magnetization in the fixed layer. See in this regard S. H. Liou et al. Magnetics IEEE Transactions on 2011. 47 10 p. 3740 3743 hereby incorporated by reference.

As seen in the reader MTJ chain for example has a maximum TMR of 22 and a maximum sensitivity of 0.48 Oe in a field of 22 Oe. The reason that the maximum sensitivity is shifted from zero field has been attributed to roughness of the films and edge effects on each MTJ giving rise to stray fields from the reference layer as described further in S. Ikeda J et al. Electron Devices IEEE Transactions on 2007. 54 5 p. 991 1002. The permanent magnet provides a probe field of 32 Oe in the sense direction of each MTJ in the chain which results in a TMR of 11 and sensitivity of 0.32 Oe with no media present.

Referring again to shown in block diagram form is an illustration of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention using a spin torque oscillator and a spectrum analyzer to read magnetic media. A reader comprises a magnetic field source not shown a constant current source spectrum analyzer spin torque oscillator STO and magnetic media . The constant current source spectrum analyzer and STO are electrically connected in parallel. Permeable material changes the effective field at the position of the sensor which then changes the precession frequency of the STO. The precession frequency is measured as a microwave voltage by the spectrum analyzer.

According to Wikipedia the spin transfer torque is an effect in which the orientation of a magnetic layer in a magnetic tunnel junction or spin valve can be modified using a spin polarized current. Charge carriers such as electrons have a property known as spin which is a small unique quantity of angular momentum intrinsic to the carrier. An electrical current is generally unpolarized consisting of 50 spin up and 50 spin down electrons a spin polarized current is one with more electrons of either spin. By passing a current through a thick magnetic layer one can produce a spin polarized current. If a spin polarized current is directed into a magnetic layer angular momentum can be transferred to the layer changing its orientation. This can be used to excite oscillations or even flip the orientation of the magnet. The effects are usually only seen in nanometer scale devices. Spin transfer torque is illustrated in . Further according to Wikipedia spin transfer torque can be used to flip the active elements in the conventional magnetic random access memory. Spin transfer torque random access memory or STT RAM has the advantages of lower power consumption and better scalability over conventional magnetoresistive random access memory MRAM which uses magnetic fields to flip the active elements. Spin transfer torque technology has the potential to make possible MRAM devices combining low current requirements and reduced cost.

Unlike conventional memory construction the preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes the property of magnetic permeability to distinguish binary bits. The bits are read with a spin transfer oscillator that uses spin transfer torque to balance the effect of damping or read with some other magnetic sensor.

The STO in is positioned to hover proximate the magnetic media . The media is comprised of first portions or bit regions having a stable nonvolatile state namely its magnetic permeability in a material such as Permalloy or Metglas. Metglas for example may be written by laser heating such that cooling rates determine whether a bit region has a high rapidly cooled amorphous state or low permeability less rapidly cooled crystalline state . The laser produces two distinct permeability regions on the Metglas that represent 1 s and 0 s. The resultant bit data may be permanent provided the Metglas is not exposed to high heat i.e. in excess of 500 C. . The bit regions may be radially aligned or arranged as a grid for accurately locating and reading the individual regions of the media . is a schematic illustration of a grid or array of cantilever heating elements. When the tips of the cantilevers are hot they can be utilized to write bits into a medium such as Metglas. In the STO also known as a spin transfer oscillator or spin transfer torque microwave oscillator is comprised of a top electrode a magnetic free layer a non magnetic layer a magnetic pinned fixed layer and a lower electrode . Often an artificial antiferromagnet not shown is used to pin the magnetization of the fixed layer. A current is passed from the current source through the STO electrodes and such that spin polarized current passes through the insulator . The magnetic moment of the free layer is in the plane parallel to the non magnetic layer . Some embodiments may be comprised of an insulator material or non magnetic material such as Magnesium Oxide MgO or Aluminum Oxide AlO . In the combination of the fixed layer insulator and free layer known as a magnetic tunnel junction the non magnetic layer or insulator layer acts as a spacer to magnetically decouple the free layer and the pinned layer . The structure of the STO thus leaves the magnetic torque of the free layer to rotate in response to external magnetic fields.

According to Wikipedia the tunnel magnetoresistance TMR is a magnetoresistive effect that occurs in a magnetic tunnel junction MTJ which is a component consisting of two ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator. If the insulating layer is thin enough typically a few nanometers electrons can tunnel from one ferromagnet into the other. Generally thin film technology or film deposition forms the magnetic tunnel junction which is accomplished by magnetron sputter deposition molecular beam epitaxy pulsed laser deposition or electron beam physical vapor deposition. The direction of the two magnetizations of the ferromagnetic films can be switched individually by an external magnetic field. If the magnetizations are in a parallel orientation it is more likely that electrons will tunnel through the insulating film than if they are in the oppositional antiparallel orientation. The magnetic field that determines the orientations of the two layers can be altered by the at least one second portions of high permeability. Consequently such a junction can be switched between two states of electrical resistance one with low and one with higher resistance which in effect measures whether the sensor is in close proximity to either a region of low permeability or high permeability.

In an STO electrons driven from the pinned layer causes electrons to orient with the field of the pinned layer then electrons interact with the free layer to cause the magnetization of the free layer to tend to align parallel with the magnetization of the pinned layer i.e. torque is transferred to the free layer . If the current direction is reversed the magnetization of the free layer tends to align antiparallel with the magnetization of the fixed layer . This torque transfer can prevent the magnetization of the free layer from relaxing and aligning parallel with the magnetic field. This causes the magnetization of the free layer to process around the direction of the magnetic field and radiate microwave energy at the Larmor frequency that is proportional to the vector cross product right arrow over M right arrow over H where right arrow over M is the magnetization of the free layer and right arrow over H is the effective field acting on the magnetization of the free layer.

The current density driving the STO must be very high e.g. 10amps cm and be spin polarized. The motion of the free layer is governed by the Landau Lifshitze Gilbert LLG equation that includes the spin transfer torque term 

In equation 1 right arrow over M is the magnetic moment. right arrow over H is the effective magnetic field whether from the pinned layer or from an external source such as the magnetic media and includes the anisotropy field magnetostatic field and exchange field. is the gyromagnetic ratio x is the direction of current flow and is a constant which determines the relaxation rate. The quantity bis given by 2 where P is the spin polarization of the current is the Bohr magnetron jis the electric current density and Mis the saturation magnetization value of M

The first term on the right hand side of the equation i.e. right arrow over M right arrow over H gives rise to the precession and the second term

The high permeability regions change the effective magnetic field right arrow over H . This in turn changes the frequency of the STO microwaves such that there is a measurable change in the frequency detected by the spectrum analyzer . The change is due to the amount of permeability for a specific bit area region on the media . The permeability of the media modifies the magnetic field right arrow over H from equation 1 in that magnetic field lines are attracted into the regions of the media with high permeability. Depending of the geometry i.e. the position of the high permeability regions in the media relative the STO this can either increase or decrease the first term in Eq. 1. This will change the precession frequency. Since the STO has a high quality factor Q small changes in the microwave radiation are easily detectable as shifts in this microwave precession frequency. The voltage across the STO may be directly measured with the spectrum analyzer such that the change in the precession frequency is detected or indirectly the amplitude and the width of the resonance frequency change may be measured. Other embodiments may include an antenna to indirectly capture and couple the signal to the spectrum analyzer .

The magnetically permeable media will modify the RF signal from the STO in two ways. Firstly the permeability will modify the magnetic field at the position of the STO by modifying magnetic flux. Modifying the field will shift the precession frequency and hence also shift the frequency of the RF signal. Secondly the media will absorb microwave energy because of resistive losses. Since energy is absorbed into the media this will affect the spin oscillation in the STO free layer and lower the Q.

As the reader operates based on the magnetic permeability of the media the memory is non volatile as permeability is an intrinsic property. Lifetime integrity is also extended almost indefinitely as the media no longer needs to have a minimum energy for maintaining the magnetization direction that determines the bit value of the individual bit regions. Furthermore since the reader is not reliant on the magnetization direction of the regions the media is not limited by the superparamagnetic limit and may have greater bit density. Thus in some exemplary embodiments the reader may read bits that are 20 20 nm or 400 nm with a bit density of 2.5 10 cm. The bit values detected by the spectrum analyzer may then be output to a computer for additional processing of the information.

The addition of the permanent magnets and allows for improved freedom to tailor the STO for particular media by modifying the frequency of the microwave radiation from the STO . The frequency modification may also allow using the maximum sensitivity of instruments such as the spectrum analyzer . depicts the exemplary embodiment including placing permanent magnets and of opposite polarity on either side of the STO and allowing the magnetic field to change the microwave frequency emitted by the STO and measured by the spectrum analyzer . Further embodiments may use one permanent magnet or multiple magnets or electromagnets to create an external magnetic field and may be proximately located to the STO as necessary to alter the microwave radiation from the STO .

The frequency counter digitizes the resulting IF signal for the threshold comparator . The comparator compares the outputted f output with some accepted value for example the predefined accept value may be determined based upon whether the shift frequency is greater than one half the expected f. The comparator applies predetermined known criteria for anticipated frequency shift values for a high or low permeability bit. The results of the high or low bits i.e. 1 or 0 are then output for processing by a computer comprising a CPU memory A D converters D A converters and digital signal processing ultimately leading to a user interface. Further embodiments may include the measured change in the frequency response as a change in quality factor gain or impedance matching.

The criterion includes a threshold for a 1 bit value at step which if returned true flags the bit location as a 1 . The method then determines if there are more bits to be read at step which if true proceeds back to align the STO with the next bit in the media or else the method ends . However if at step it is determined the 1 bit value threshold is not met the method determines whether the threshold for the bit value is a 0 at step . Should the threshold for bit 0 be met the bit location is accordingly flagged as a 0 and the method continues to determine if more bits are to be read at step . However if step determines the threshold for the 0 bit value is not met the method ends as an error or inconclusive reading. One of ordinary skill in the art would know of a variety of methods for dealing with this situation. For example the cycle could be repeated and if the threshold still is not met a determination of the value of the bit might be deduced from the context of information about neighboring bits. An alternative would be planned redundancy in crucial places where bits are essentially duplicated. Error correcting methods could also be used. In an exemplary embodiment wherein the frequency response is measured the measured frequency shift is compared with predetermined frequency criterion for bit values. As an example a 1 is where f f 2 and 0 is f 0 where fis the preset expected value for the high permeability bit.

Other further embodiments may include rewritable media such as the ferromagnetic class of alloys known as Metglas. Metglas is a material that has a high magnetic permeability of approximately 10 000 N Ain the amorphous state and a low permeability of approximately 5 10 N Awhen it is crystalline. By controlling the cooling rate from above 800 C. that results from heating by for example using an e beam or evanescent wave it is possible to rewrite the media by making the material either crystalline or amorphous. Other embodiments may include multiple levels that are based on corresponding levels of permeability and saturation. The multiple levels of permeability may thus also allow for more information to be stored per bit area and or greater bit density. Nevertheless the reader disclosed above utilizes intrinsic magnetic permeability and thus provides the ability to read magnetic media that is effectively immune from corruption by magnetic fields.

Returning now to the preferred embodiment shown in is an illustration showing the percentage tunneling magnetoresistance TMR of an MTJ reader chain in different magnetic field strengths. TMR and sensitivity for the MTJ reader chain is depicted. The black boxes show percentage changes in the tunneling magnetoresistance TMR while the hollow boxes show show the sensitivity as a function of the field acting on the MTJ. Field shunting or enhancement at the reader is determined by respective negative or positive changes in the TMR.

In the reader is swept at approximately 3 Hz and 30 Hz under a group of three lines with w 50 microns a lateral separation of 50 microns and d 10 microns. The amplitude and SNR in both cases are comparable to situation depicted in where the sweep rate was slower. The insensitivity to sweep rate indicates our approach has a scalability towards higher reading rates. shows data taken using a similar 3 Hz sweep both before and after the media was exposed to a large 6400 Oe field for 60 seconds. Such sweeps of which the post field scan is representative were repeated multiple times with the 6400 Oe field at different orientations to the reader. Within experimental error the amplitude and SNR is unchanged indicating the non erasability of the information in large magnetic fields.

In accordance with the above one can read 10 micron wide non erasable or nonvolatile magnetic lines and distinguish regions of high and low permeability with a SNR of 45 dB. In addition to showing that the read rate is capable of improvement an increase in the SNR is expected to be obtainable by optimizing the performance of our MTJ readers. Since the lower limit on media size is determined by the reader dimensions and fly height and not the thermal stability of the media higher density media are not constrained by the superparamagnetic limit. Through the effect of shunting of flux across a gap in a magnetic circuit by a soft magnetic material a reader can detect an enhancement of the probe field and thus sense the presence of soft ferromagnetic media field in other configurations as reported in U.S. Pat. No. 7 233 142 to Edelstein hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein. In fact any detectable change in the probe field magnitude and or direction due to differences in media permeability should suffice for the reading process Finally because e beam writing is expensive alternative methods for low cost recording re writing of media consisting of regions of high and low magnetic permeability may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. The ability to write as well as read such non erasable or nonvolatile media can potentially fulfill the growing need to store both large and small amounts of data indefinitely.

Turning now to a comparison of read heads is illustrated. In the left portion the bit is determined by the direction of the magnetic field generated by the remanent magnetization in the bits of the media. This illustrates current magnetic memory technology that senses the direction of magnetic domain fields an extrinsic property. The disadvantages include information can be erased by exposure to magnetic fields or radiation and thermal instability leading to superparamagnetism constraints on the density of information and storage lifetime usually 

Shown to the right in the non erasable or nonvolatile magnetic memory of the preferred embodiment senses the modification of a probe field H by the magnetic permeability of a soft ferromagnet an intrinsic property. The advantages are that the storage is unaffected by magnetic fields or radiation thermal instability does not lead to superparamagnetism constraints limiting information density storage lifetime and the probe field may be tailored to the read head media.

Types of writing using preferred embodiments of the present invention include A e beam writing optical lithography which may be utilized in conjunction with a non erasable or nonvolatile card system 10 m capability and has the potential for permanent archiving at 50 nm. B Thermal laser writing which may be utilized in conjunction with a non erasable card system 10 m capability and has the potential for permanent archiving at 50 nm with 20 msec. writing time. C Thermal hot tip or ohmic heating writing which has capability of writing on a 10 nm scale. D Thermal joule writing with an scanning tunneling microscope which has the capability of writing at the 10 nm scale. The thermal writing can be aided by heating the all of the media so that the energy needed for writing individual bits is smaller. E Dip pen writing or magnetic ink jet writing which has a potential for writing on a submicron scale. One can use an MTJ reader 20 nm and STO reader with a read time of 20 sec.

Thermal writing and reading with MTJ STOs is applicable towards radiation hard DOD space applications magnetic swipe cards and ID tagging. Archiving at current information density is expected for thermal writing with cantilevers shown in and MTJ STO reading is very likely. Information written in this manner is intrinsically robust and difficult to tamper with or change.

Alternatives to highly permeable permalloys and low permeability air for use in conjunction with the present invention include soft amorphous ferromagnetic material with magnetic species e.g. Fe and network glass formers e.g. Si B that hinder nucleation e.g. Metglas 2605 SA2 with composition FeSiB . Optical or electron beam lithography may be utilized as well as potentially dip pen deposition. For thermal writing on Metglas one could sputter amorphous phase which is magnetically soft and has high permeability greater than 10 000. The crystalline phase has low magnetic permeability 10. An alternative is to go from amorphous to crystalline phase in Metglas by heating above the glass temperature 400 500 C. Another alternative is to go from crystalline to amorphous phase by first melting 1100 C. followed by rapid quenching 10 C. sec. In another alternative for non rewritable storage thin superparamagnetic layers of a magnetic species e.g. Fe could be interspersed with non magnetic layers e.g. Cu . Before heating the layers would have high permeability. Selective heating of regions i.e. bits would induce interdiffusion between the layers resulting in low permeability regions. Presently thermally writing is being done with a laser.

It is noted that magnetization M tends to precess around magnetic field H and to relax into the direction of the field. The spin polarized current can maintain the angle between M H and the system radiates at a microwave frequencies dependent on H and the changing H via soft magnetic material changes the frequency of the STO. The sense element size is 100 nm. Thus one can probably read 100 nm bits if the fly height is of order 100 mm or still smaller.

Using the preferred embodiments reading 10 micron wide permalloy lines with a 45 dB signal to noise ratio have been attained using magnetic tunnel junctions. Spin transfer oscillators can also be used for reading. Potential applications include tagging a magnetic card reader magnetic tunnel junctions used for reading laser thermal writing of magnetic material securely storing large amount of data indefinitely ability to go to sub microns features 100 nm spin transfer oscillators STO and high density magnetic recording.

Alternate approaches within the scope of the present invention include initially using a hot plate to heat Metglas above glass temperature 400 degrees C. so that it will crystallize and enable operator to write a line at a lower localized thermal energy than otherwise. illustrates alternative writing approaches utilizing the principles of the present invention. The present invention contemplates dip pen writing which is at present limited to micron size features. One can use parallel tips . Issues remain with wetting. Another form of thermal writing would involve a hot filament e.g. Tantalum wire that can transfer energy to the magnetic media e.g. magnetic swipe card to form lines of high and low permeability.

Alternate approaches towards writing include e beam writing sputtering soft magnetic film laser control of amorphous and crystalline phases ink jet like printing of the high magnetic permeability bits creating nanoparticle slurry dip pen writing and thermal writing with sub micron pens.

Advantages of the preferred embodiment systems include the features that the information is not erased by magnetic fields or radiation not affected by superparamagnetic limit a card write and read systems with these advantages very large commercial potential for a system that can securely store large amounts of data for decades low cost writing of bits low density applications difficult to tamper with or modify the data e.g. ID cards using laser thermal writing of Metglas high density applications using dip pen or thermal writing of Metglas with heated element.
