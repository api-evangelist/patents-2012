As our daily activities become ever more reliant on support or enhancement via applications or other software tools such as mobile applications services a growing problem facing a typical end user of an electronic device is that of the ability to efficiently access cross application updates and events. Another challenge is to effectively monitor and navigate to and through the multiple services to which an end user is subscribed to use the desired feature or to access a given update or event.

Further complexity is introduced as messages or events are generated in multiple different formats and transmitted over multiple communications channels email status updates feeds news feeds Short Message Service SMS Instant Messaging IM and social networks e.g. tweets Facebook generated messages etc. across multiple applications. Thus the messages intended for a user may need to be accessed by using and therefore launching several different applications with each application generating notifications status indications etc. The overall situation is one of complexity and impacts usability with multiple events spread across different applications and various communication channels.

In one embodiment a user of a host device is registered with a plurality of electronic services an event is detected on a host device by the electronic social messaging platform an option associated with the event is selected by the electronic social messaging platform and the option associated with the event is provided to the user of the host device by the electronic social messaging platform wherein the plurality of electronic services comprises social networking portals messaging utility applications electronic data storage utilities and electronic data sharing utilities wherein registering the user comprises establishing a signal connection with each of the plurality of electronic services accessed by the host device creating a user profile for the user of the host device for each of the plurality of electronic services and providing a plurality of settings associated with each of the plurality of electronic services wherein the plurality of settings comprise timing settings privacy settings data recall settings data routing settings data type settings data hierarchy settings language settings scheduling settings and data security settings wherein detecting an event comprises at least one of detecting receipt of a text file from an electronic service detecting receipt of a audio file from an electronic service detecting a physical movement of the host device resulting from a physical gesture of a user detecting receipt of a video file from an electronic service and detecting accessing of a file on the host device and wherein selecting an option comprises at least one of reproducing a plurality of options provided by the plurality of electronic services retrieving an option associated with the event from memory and appending retrieved option to a plurality of options provided by the plurality of electronic services and retrieving an option associated with the event from memory and embedding retrieved option within a plurality of options provided by the plurality of electronic services.

A method and system provide for universal social messaging where an event is detecting on a host device by the electronic social messaging platform an option associated with the event is selected by the electronic social messaging platform and the option associated with the event is provided to the user of the host device by the electronic social messaging platform. Functions and techniques performed by the Universal Social Messaging Platform USMP for unified cross application event management are described in detail with further references to the examples of .

The USMP is an extended personalized social media platform that may encompass users channels of interest and harmonize secure and streamline access to others and to a wide variety of services. As a unifying platform it allows users to access the same social outlet channels from any end point as long as these social outlets channels are connected to the platform. Users can define and customize their own set of groups and communities with contacts from different social outlets for example a group may comprise a follower from Twitter a friend from Facebook and a Google contact .

According to an embodiment the USMP may be any system device hardware middleware and or software and or any combination thereof that is able to establish a connection with or be integrated with other devices and services such as user devices and service providers . In one embodiment the USMP may be coupled with user devices via at least one communication network . In another embodiment the USMP may be integrated in user devices as a utility service running on a background. In yet another embodiment the USMP may be directly connected to user devices . It is to be understood that the USMP may be communicating with or accessed by user devices and by service providers in the cloud. In addition the USMP may be configured to be available to user devices on demand for example based either on local processes occurring on user devices or based on processes driven by applications or services provided by service providers .

According to an embodiment user devices can be any system and or device and or any combination of devices systems that is able to establish a connection with another device a server and or other systems such as the USMP and or service providers . It is to be understood that user devices can include mobile or portable devices or non portable devices and can be any of but not limited to a server desktop a desktop computer a computer cluster or portable devices including a notebook a laptop computer a handheld computer a palmtop computer a mobile phone a cell phone a smart phone a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a handheld tablet e.g. an iPad a handheld console a handheld gaming device or console and or any other portable mobile handheld devices etc.

According to an embodiment service providers may provide applications content and services that include those used to read and generate emails instant messages SMS or other forms of messages. The messaging applications and communications services may also include social network based applications such as Facebook Twitter Flickr Gtalk LinkedIn Skype or the like. Thus the disclosed USMP may provide a more efficient interface to enable a user to interact with multiple applications and communication channels.

According to an embodiment at least one communication network over which the user devices and the USMP communicate may be a cellular network a telephonic network an open network such as the Internet or a private network such as an intranet and or the extranet a secure communications protocol such as secure sockets layer SSL or transport layer security TLS or any combination thereof. For example the Internet can provide file transfer remote log in email news RSS cloud based services and other services through any known or convenient protocol such as but is not limited to the TCP IP protocol Open System Interconnections OSI File Transfer Protocol FTP Universal Plug and Flay UPnP Internet Small Computer System Interface iSCSI Network Specific Facilities NSF Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy PDH RS 232 port Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH Synchronous Optical NETwork SONET etc. The communication network can be any collection of distinct networks operating wholly or partially in conjunction to provide connectivity to the user devices and to the USMP and may appear as one or more networks to the service providers .

Communications also can be achieved via one or more of Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX a Local Area Network LAN Wireless Local Area Network WLAN a Personal area network PAN a Campus area network CAN a Metropolitan area network MAN a Wide area network WAN a Wireless wide area network WWAN enabled with technologies such as by way of example Global System for Mobile Communications GSM Personal Communications Service PCS Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service D Amps Bluetooth Wi Fi Fixed Wireless Data 2G 2.5G 3G 4G IMT Advanced pre 4G 3G LTE 3GPP LTE LTE Advanced mobile WiMax WiMax 2 WirelessMAN Advanced networks enhanced data rates for GSM evolution EDGE General packet radio service GPRS enhanced GPRS iBurst UMTS HSPDA HSUPA HSPA UMTS TDD 1 RTT EV DO messaging protocols such as TCP IP SMS MMS extensible messaging and presence protocol XMPP real time messaging protocol RTMP instant messaging and presence protocol IMPP instant messaging USSD IRC or any other wireless data networks or messaging protocols.

According to an embodiment content may be transmitted from the sender to the receiver by way of a network and a cloud database that processes the information and determines the proper routing recipients and directional guidelines from the graphical user interface. This method allows content to flow from peer to peer while being temporarily cached at a centralized location with the USMP providing content. The USMP may employ several known and proprietary routing algorithms to ensure that the content is transmitted to the desired intended audience.

According to an embodiment in order to enable user device for USMP functionality user device has to register with the USMP . During registration the user may need to provide personal information to obtain unique user identifiers to be used to connect to the USMP or to download the USMP to be run on one or more user devices .

It is to be understood that registration process may include a number of steps such as creating storing and maintaining a user profile by obtaining user s data interests hobbies access to service providers with whom the user already has membership privileges downloading user s contacts address book information allowing the user to create hybrid contact lists comprising acquaintances made through various services. For example the hybrid contact list may include user s immediate family members user s co workers and user s friends where user s immediate family members contact information may be reached via user s contacts list stored on the user device user s co workers may be reached by InMail in LinkedIn and user s friends may be reached via their contact info on Facebook .

As may be appreciated one or more options e.g. contact lists may be generated and arranged in a certain order by the USMP based on the user s customary actions. Such actions may include frequent access of certain contacts frequent use of certain service providers or frequent particular use of certain functionalities of the user device . For example during registration or at any time thereafter the USMP may offer the user a suggested contact list for one or more occasions. One example is that the USMP may offer the user a list of people to whom the user sends pictures more frequently than others.

One skilled in the art will recognize that the system configuration of is non limiting and that components of the presented system may be combined in any way in various embodiments and may include any additional and or desired components and or configurations.

Returning to at step an option associated with the event is selected by the USMP based on information in the user profile. In an embodiment the option selected by the USMP may be an addition to the options already made available to the user by device manufacturers or by service providers . The option may also be a modification of and or improvement to already existing options. For example when the USMP detects that the user device is used to take a photographic picture of one or more persons an option to remove a red eye effect may be selected from a database of options maintained by the USMP . In another example when the USMP detects that the user device is in receipt of SMS containing shortcuts e.g. lol tnx btw etc. an option to transform the shortcuts into complete words may be selected from the USMP database.

In an embodiment upon detecting the generation or forwarding of any transmission email SMS MMS Twit chat IM etc. the USMP may provide the user of the user device with content privacy options as illustrated in . Such a privacy option allows users to make their conversations and messages private or opaque to 3parties. In another embodiment users may be provided with an option to make their content and messages viewable to the public or specific audiences for a designated amount of time. So upon expiration of a designated period of time a selected transmission or content would be set to private or the content would be removed from the accessible cloud file system server.

In yet another embodiment the USMP may provide the user of the user device with an option to recall transmitted content. Upon user s selection of content recall functionality the USMP which may track the content to its destination invokes the recall in much the same way as the USMP activates a change in privacy settings.

It is to be understood that options associated with a detected event may be implemented by a policy hierarchy within your PSM Net. Distribution of content may be handled by policies defined within user s PSM Net as well. For example users may want content to be tweeted to certain people at certain predetermined times based on subject and or grouping. Additional functionality allowing for content to be copy transmitted to other recipients via other routing options e.g. email IM etc. may also be available through the USMP as illustrated in .

In an embodiment the USMP may invoke one or more options dealing with corporate and other personal policies of the users and recipients of the content. That is content could be propagated across PSM Net domains so that recipients of the content would only receive it via an appropriate mechanism and at an appropriate time. For example corporate emails are either securely delivered to clients not delivered to clients or that clients simply receive a notice that a secure proprietary or private message or content is waiting for them on another network delivery mechanism.

In yet another embodiment upon detecting receipt of content in a certain format the USMP may provide the user of the user device with an option to transparently convert content to other suitable formats. For example upon detecting that the user device has received a voice message the option to convert the voice message into a text message or email may be selected by the USMP .

One skilled in the art will recognize that the list of exemplary options selected by the USMP at step of method of is non limiting and may include any additional and or desired options.

Returning to at step the option selected from the user profile is provided by the USMP to the user. In an advantageous embodiment the option may be provided to the user as an additional option being displayed alongside the options already being offered by either manufacturer of the user device or by one of the service providers to which the user is subscribed through the user device e.g. delete save forward the picture save the picture as wallpaper or forward the SMS to one or more existing contacts .

In an embodiment at step the USMP may launch a unified access universal graphical user interface for consolidated access of cross application events and related contacts. The unified access universal graphical user interface disclosed herein can be actuated and interacted with using any conventional or known input device including but not limited to physical keyboard touch screen display motion sensor microphone mouse other types of pointer devices and any additional input device. The unified access and management of cross application features events and contacts functionality can be provided locally on user devices by the USMP to be used to access applications e.g. including mobile applications accounts websites services documents files media or any other content such as those provided by a third party hosts. For example the USMP can include a multi application contact oriented engine accessible over the network by user devices to enable concurrent access and management of events detected on user devices .

In an advantageous embodiment the disclosed unified access universal graphical user interface further enables a user to perform the most commonly accessed functions of each of multiple mobile applications without having to launch or interact with the entire application. This allows a user to have an integrated view of these functions across multiple applications and communications channels. This provides a user with a more efficient way to check the status notifications or inbox or its equivalent of multiple communication modes without having to launch and navigate through each of multiple messaging applications or communications channels.

The unified access universal graphical user interface for consolidated or simultaneous access of application events and associated contacts may also be provided and enabled on a per application content basis based on the services provided by the service providers via a contact oriented messaging application. In one of the embodiment the unified access universal graphical user interface may enable the user to propagate a single message generated by the user simultaneously to several destinations across multiple applications and communications channels. For example the user who wishes to post a note about his or her vacation may elect an option to post a simultaneous note to all suitable services e.g. Facebook Twitter a family circle of Google etc. . Upon detection that such an option was selected the user s note is translated by the USMP into a corresponding appropriate format for each selected service and simultaneously propagated to the service providers .

In an embodiment at step the USMP may invoke a unified access universal graphical user interface which incorporates already existing options and the option selected by the USMP in response to the event. In another embodiment the USMP may modify a graphical user interface provided by the user device to include the option selected by the USMP .

It is to be understood that in order to be able to modify the graphical user interface provided by the user device the USMP may have to obtain a license from a manufacturer of a user device to introduce such modifications. It is also to be understood that such modification may be made if the USMP is in possession of an Application Programming Interface API licensed from a manufacturer of a user device for such and related purposes. The same requirements may apply to the USMP in relation to modifying a graphical user interface provided by service providers .

In an embodiment the unified access universal graphical user interface may be contact based and not application based to provide a more efficient way for the user to interact with a contact regardless of the contact s means of communication or preferred mode of messaging.
