The present invention generally relates to wireless communications and more particularly to fusion of cellular and non cellular communications.

Wireless communications systems are used in a variety of telecommunications systems television radio and other media systems data communication networks and other systems to convey information between remote points using wireless transmitters and wireless receivers. A transmitter is an electronic device that usually with the aid of an antenna propagates an electromagnetic signal modulated with information such as radio television or other signals. A receiver is an electronic device that receives a wireless electromagnetic signal and processes the information modulated thereon. A transmitter and receiver may be combined into a single device called a transceiver.

Wireless communications may be made for many Equipment UE devices to be used in a cellular coverage area using one or more base stations.

In yet another embodiment base station and endpoint may be configured to transport data to be transmitted to network over LTE link and to offload such traffic under certain conditions to Wi Fi link . Base station may be configured to make decisions about when and how to offload such traffic and may inform affected endpoints . In one further embodiment such an offload of traffic to Wi Fi link may be in place of traffic on LTE link . In another further embodiment such an offload of traffic to Wi Fi link may be in addition to traffic on LTE link . The offloading of cellular data may be performed by insertion of cellular data into the payload of Wi Fi data . The simultaneous transmittal of cellular traffic on LTE link and Wi Fi link may include different data on cellular data and cellular data or redundant data on cellular data and cellular data . Furthermore the form of cellular data within Wi Fi data may be of the same form as cellular data or the form of cellular data may be of a modified form as cellular data . Such modifications may include transmittal of cellular data in a different PDU or different protocol layer.

In operation base station may determine to offload of some or all of the transport of cellular data between endpoint and base station to Wi Fi link .

If cellular data is redundant of cellular data base station may utilize cellular data to plug in missing or erroneous portions of cellular data or vice versa. Such situations may arise when for example LTE link is weak.

The recipient in cellular backhaul network may receive the same cellular data stream regardless of whether any traffic was offloaded from LTE link to Wi Fi link .

Furthermore data to be sent to application by cellular backhaul network may be determined by base station . Base station through cellular module Wi Fi module or any other suitable portion of base station may determine which portions of such data to offload and how such data is to be transformed if applicable. The resulting cellular data may be placed within the payload of Wi Fi data and transmitted through Wi Fi module over Wi Fi link to endpoint . Wi Fi module may receive Wi Fi data . In parallel cellular data may be transmitted over LTE link from cellular module to cellular module . Endpoint may extract cellular data from Wi Fi data . If necessary endpoint may transform cellular data into an expected data form such as that used by cellular data . Base station may extract cellular data if necessary and recombine cellular data and cellular data into a cellular data stream to be sent to application . If cellular data is redundant of cellular data base station may utilize cellular data to plug in missing or erroneous portions of cellular data or vice versa.

If cellular data is not redundant of cellular data base station may reorder and reorganize the PDUs so that the resulting cellular data stream is coherent. Application may receive the same cellular data stream regardless of whether any traffic was offloaded from LTE link to Wi Fi link .

For example in a cellular data may be transmitted over LTE link between endpoint and base station . Endpoint and base station may apply switching to the transport of cellular data such that the data stream of cellular data is now transported over Wi Fi link instead of LTE link . The contents of cellular data may now be transported through cellular data resident within the payload of Wi Fi data . In one embodiment cellular data and cellular data are implemented using the same PDU or protocol layer. In such an embodiment cellular data and cellular data may be equivalent. In another embodiment cellular data and cellular data are implemented using different PDUs or protocol layers. Modification of cellular data from the form of cellular data may be performed by the sender i.e. endpoint or base station . The recipient of cellular data i.e. endpoint or base station may obtain cellular data s from the payload of Wi Fi data and reverse the modification of the form of cellular data . Thus the cellular transport of data between endpoint and base station may be switched to non cellular transport.

In another example in b cellular data may be transmitted over LTE link between endpoint and base station . Endpoint and base station may apply aggregation to the transport of cellular data such that the data stream of cellular data may be replicated by or transferred in part to Wi Fi link . The contents of cellular data may now be transported wholly or in part through cellular data resident within the payload of Wi Fi data . Furthermore any remaining contents of cellular data may be now be transported in part through cellular data . In one embodiment cellular data cellular data and cellular data may be implemented using the same PDU or protocol layer. In another embodiment cellular data may be implemented using different PDUs or protocol layers that cellular data or cellular data . Modification of cellular data from the form of cellular data may be performed by the sender i.e. endpoint or base station . Redundant operation may include sending both cellular data and cellular data with equivalent underlying information. Non redundant operation may include dividing a data stream to be sent into portions and sending a first portion through cellular data and a second portion through cellular data . The recipient of cellular data i.e. endpoint or base station may reverse the modification of the form of cellular data . In addition the recipient may reconcile received cellular data and cellular data . In one embodiment wherein redundant operation is used endpoint and base station may determine whether any of cellular data or cellular data contain errors or missing information and fill in such gaps with the other data sample. In another embodiment wherein non redundant operation is used endpoint and base station may determine a coherent ordering or structure of cellular data and cellular data and recombine cellular data and cellular data into a coherent data stream. Thus the cellular transport of data between endpoint and base station may be aggregated with non cellular transport.

Base station and endpoint may be configured to perform switching and or aggregation in the transport of data to data . Such a decision may be made by base station and communicated to endpoint . The decision to perform switching and or aggregation may be made in real time during the processing of information and may change while transporting a given datastream. In one embodiment base station may be configured to select aggregation operation by default.

Base station may select aggregation for any suitable purpose. In one embodiment base station may select aggregation with redundant data between data links in response to a need or desire for higher reliability communication for one or more endpoints. In another embodiment base station may select aggregation without redundant data between data links in response to a need or desire for higher throughput capacity. Use of the cellular band portion of the electromagnetic spectrum may be expensive or crowded when compared to use of non cellular bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. The needs observed by base station may be made of the operation of network or of other portions of a cellular network.

Furthermore base station may select switching for any suitable purpose. Switching may be selected by base station in response to a need or desire to offload use of cellular band transmissions. The needs observed by base station may be made of the operation of network or of other portions of a cellular network.

Switching or aggregating may be applied opportunistically. For example base station may select switching and or aggregating to offload cellular traffic whenever adequate bandwidth is available on a non cellular channel. Such switching and or aggregating may be made by base station even for a short duration. Switching or aggregating may be applied in response to observed conditions. For example aggregating may be applied in response to determining that endpoint has a poor cellular signal connection such as LTE link . In particular aggregation of modified cellular data over LTE link and Wi Fi link including portions of the cellular data with hybrid automatic repeat requests HARQ may improve the quality of signal overall between endpoint and base station .

Furthermore switching or aggregation may be selected according to the nature or content of the data to be sent between base station and endpoint . One factor in such selection may include the level of real time quality of service required by the traffic. Any specific quality of service may not be available for non cellular links such as Wi Fi link compared to LTE link . Thus switching may be applied for applications or data streams that self correct for errors or are latency tolerant such as File Transport Protocol FTP or Transport Control Protocol TCP traffic. Furthermore switching may be applied though with less preference for applications and data streams that can tolerate low error rates but are tolerant of latency such as buffered video streaming. In addition switching may be applied though with less preference for applications and data streams that can tolerate medium error rates but are require low latency such as live video conferencing. In contrast full switching might not be preferred for applications or data streams such as conversational voice conversational video or real time gaming. In such applications aggregation may yet be usable.

In other implementations of switching between end to end use of cellular and non cellular networks the destination networks may be required to perform significant accounting and management to switch endpoints and in between equipment. Such operations may be expensive from a resource perspective and require coordination. Furthermore delay may be experienced as data streams are switched from one end to end process to another. In some embodiments endpoint and base station may conduct switching and aggregation without knowledge or intervention of other portions of the network such as cellular backhaul network or network . In such embodiments endpoint and base station may conduct switching and aggregation using cellular data at a lower wireless protocol level. Furthermore endpoint and base station may conduct switching and aggregation without manual intervention by a user of network .

In one embodiment sender may be implemented by endpoint and recipient may be implemented by base station wherein Wi Fi module is a more detailed illustration of Wi Fi module cellular module is a more detailed illustration of cellular module Wi Fi module is a more detailed illustration of Wi Fi module and cellular module is a more detailed illustration of cellular module . In another embodiment recipient may be implemented by endpoint and sender may be implemented by base station wherein Wi Fi module is a more detailed illustration of Wi Fi module cellular module is a more detailed illustration of cellular module Wi Fi module is a more detailed illustration of Wi Fi module and cellular module is a more detailed illustration of cellular module . At various times or modes of operation each of endpoint and base station may be variably configured to be either sender recipient or both. LTE link may be implemented fully or in part by LTE link and Wi Fi link may be implemented fully or in part by Wi Fi link .

Sender may be configured to transport data to recipient . Data may originate from for example application or a recipient in cellular backhaul network and may be configured to be delivered to for example a recipient in cellular backhaul network or application . Data upon completion of the operation of recipient may be configured to be of the form of cellular data to be transported across LTE link .

Cellular module may be configured to process data for transport across cellular links such as LTE link according to a suitable cellular protocol such as LTE or LTE A. Such processing may include the transformation of data through various layers of the cellular protocol. Such layers may depend upon the specific cellular protocol used. In the example of for LTE such layers may include a Physical Layer PHY a Media Access Control Layer MAC resident above PHY a Radio Link Control RLC Layer resident above MAC and a Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP Layer resident above RLC . Such layers may be controlled by cellular module . The layers may be configured to provide communication of data that can be provided at an application or user level by for example application physically transmitted over a cellular link such as LTE link and reassembled and retransmitted by a recipient. Cellular module may be configured to capture cellular data as it is to be transported over a cellular link such as LTE link . Such cellular data may be represented for example as cellular IP data .

Cellular module may similarly include the ability to parse convert or otherwise reorganize data according to various sublayers of the cellular protocol. For example cellular module may include PDCP resident on top of RLC which may be resident on top of MAC which may be resident on top of PHY . Upon receipt of data cellular module may perform error checking request missing information and reassemble the data stream for communication to its destination.

In one embodiment cellular module may be configured to provide such information to Wi Fi module which may be configured to place such information as is into the payload of Wi Fi data . Thus Wi Fi module may be configured to transport the equivalent of cellular IP data in IP data resident within Wi Fi data to Wi Fi module .

In other embodiments cellular module may be configured to provide cellular data from a cellular protocol sublayer such as an LTE sublayer to Wi Fi module which may be configured to place such information as is into the payload of Wi Fi data to be transported over Wi Fi link to Wi Fi module . Wi Fi module may be configured to provide the received data to cellular module which may be configured to reconstruct the original data stream and output data . Where IP data is communicated from Wi Fi module Wi Fi module may be configured to provide IP data as output data . Such reconstruction may include reassembly up or down the cellular protocol sublayers. The information taken from a given sublayer may include information as appropriated into PDUs as defined by the cellular protocol.

Sender may be configured to send any suitable cellular protocol sublayer messages to recipient through Wi Fi link . For example cellular module may provide PDCP messages to Wi Fi module which may place the PDCP messages into the payload of Wi Fi data in the form of PDCP data . Wi Fi module may be configured to receive Wi Fi data extract PDCP data and pass PDCP data to cellular module . Cellular module maybe configured to reconstruct the original data stream based on PDCP data . To perform such reconstruction PDCP data may be converted to another layer of the cellular protocol. Furthermore PDCP data or data resulting from its transformation may be combined with data received separately such as data received in cellular IP data .

In another example cellular module may provide RLC messages to Wi Fi module which may place the RLC messages into the payload of Wi Fi data in the form of RLC data . Wi Fi module may be configured to receive Wi Fi data extract RLC data and pass RLC data to cellular module . Cellular module maybe configured to reconstruct the original data stream based on RLC data . To perform such reconstruction RLC data may be converted to another layer of the cellular protocol. Furthermore RLC data or data resulting from its transformation may be combined with data received separately such as data received in cellular IP data .

In yet another example cellular module may provide MAC messages to Wi Fi module which may place the MAC messages into the payload of Wi Fi data in the form of MAC data . Wi Fi module may be configured to receive Wi Fi data extract MAC data and pass MAC data to cellular module . Cellular module maybe configured to reconstruct the original data stream based on MAC data . To perform such reconstruction MAC data may be converted to another layer of the cellular protocol. Furthermore MAC data or data resulting from its transformation may be combined with data received separately such as data received in cellular IP data .

Sender may be configured to send cellular protocol sublayer messages to recipient through Wi Fi link in order to conduct aggregation switching or both operations. During aggregation the information underlying the sublayer data such as PDCP data RLC data or MAC data may be equivalent to the information underlying cellular IP data . Furthermore during aggregation IP data may be equivalent to cellular IP data . During switching the information underlying the PDCP data RLC data MAC data or IP data would have been equivalent to the information underlying cellular IP data except cellular IP data might not be sent.

By converting data from sublayers back to the original intended data stream in recipient the operation in cellular backhaul network and or network is unaffected by the operations of as compared to another implementation which merely transports cellular IP data to recipient .

Performing switching or aggregation at a given cellular protocol sublayer may provide advantages or disadvantages. The specific choice of which sublayer to utilize for switching or aggregation may be determined by the conditions of a given network implementation the instant conditions of the network or empirically.

For example transmission of cellular data as IP data may avoid use of cellular spectrum protocols. Its implementation may be easier than implementation of transmission of sublayers due to the reduced coordination required for reassembly. Existing endpoints may be required to be modified at an application or operative system layer. However given the extra time required to assemble IP data the efficiency savings may be less than use of sublayers.

In another example transmission of cellular data as PDCP data may include the advantages of transmission of cellular data as IP data as well as reducing the header overhead of transmission of cellular data such as IP data more secure transmission over Wi Fi link and no need to an extra procedure to reorder IP packets at recipient . In LTE PDCP may provide security which allows transmission of such data over Wi Fi may require less Wi Fi based security. Header compression may not otherwise be available for Wi Fi. Further in order IP packets of the cellular data which are then transmitted in order through Wi Fi may avoid buffering and processing that may otherwise occur when transmitting data above PDCP . However modification of existing endpoints may require a change an operating system or firmware level. Further such transmission is more complex to implement as the application layer cannot be merely relied upon.

In yet another example transmission of cellular data as MAC data may include the advantages of transmission of cellular data as IP data and transmission of cellular data as PDCP data as well as being able to perform LTE channel coding combining blocks received from Wi Fi and LTE predictive Wi Fi payloads and better throughput from Wi Fi links. The use in MAC of functions for Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request HARQ may provide one or more of these benefits. A transport block of cellular data may be concatenated into code blocks for a Wi Fi payload. The code blocks may be sent via Wi Fi payloads and upon receipt of an acknowledgment the copy of the code block that was sent may be discarded. If no acknowledgement is sent the code block may be resent. Recipient may be able to combine different code blocks received over Wi Fi and LTE links. Furthermore since the length of the code blocks to be transmitted is known a scheduler of cellular module scheduler may inform a scheduler of Wi Fi module of a pending payload with a given length. When Wi Fi link is sufficiently clear a request to send packet with the proper network allocation vector may be sent immediately. Wi Fi link may be unable to provide guaranteed service or transmission. Thus asynchronous operations such as downlink HARQ usage as opposed to uplink HARQ usage may be preferable for MAC transmission. However implementation of such a scheme requires close integration between LTE and the respective MAC and PHY layers of Wi Fi operations.

RLC may include functions for Automatic Repeat Request ARQ . Such functions may be best suiting for acknowledge mode bearers. In such cases the operation of the RLC may be similar to the operation of MAC . However some benefits such as channel coding may be unavailable. In one embodiment the use of RLC for transmission of LTE information may be subsumed by the use of MAC .

The decision of which cellular sublayer if any to use to transport cellular data through non cellular channels for aggregation or switching may be made for example by base station . The decision may be made in real time based on instant conditions and may be specific to a given endpoint . The decision may include for example determinations of the congestion of the cellular bands and of the availability of non cellular capacity.

Given that transmission of cellular data on Wi Fi link through MAC data may be more efficient than through PDCP data if less capacity is available on Wi Fi link base station may determine that MAC data is to be used to conduct switching or aggregation. Furthermore given that that transmission of cellular data on Wi Fi link through PDCP data may be more efficient than through IP data if less capacity is available on Wi Fi link base station may determine that MAC data is to be used to conduct switching or aggregation. However if the capacity available on Wi Fi link is low enough base station may determine that none of these should be used to facilitate transmission of cellular data because the data is unlikely to reach recipient . In such a case no switching or aggregation may be performed.

Given that transmission of cellular data on Wi Fi link through MAC data may more efficiently offload cellular data than through PDCP data or IP data if LTE link is greatly congested then base station may determine that MAC data is to be used to conduct switching or aggregation. Furthermore given that transmission of cellular data on Wi Fi link through PDCP data may more efficiently offload cellular data than through IP data but not as efficiently as through MAC data if LTE link is moderately congested then base station may determined that PDCP data is to be used to conduct switching or aggregation. In addition given that transmission of cellular data on Wi Fi link through IP data may be capable of offloading cellular data but not as efficiently as through use of PDCP data or MAC data if LTE link is lightly congested then base station may determine that IP data is to be used to conduct switching or aggregation. However if LTE link has no congestion whatsoever then use of IP data MAC data or PDCP data to aggregate or switch transmission of cellular data may be unnecessary.

Simulation best practices or empirical testing may be used to determine the balance of these considerations to guide the operation of base station to select which if any sublayer technique to use when performing switching or aggregation of cellular data through non cellular links.

In 1 below a given availability benchmark A or above a given congestion index C no sublayer or other switching or aggregation techniques may be used. Furthermore above a given congestion index C no sublayer or other switching or aggregation techniques may be used for available Wi Fi capacity between Aand Afor certain congestion indices. In addition for available Wi Fi capacity between Aand A no sublayer or other switching or aggregation techniques may be used for certain congestion indices.

In 2 IP data may be used to conduct switching or aggregation. IP data may be used given that the congestion index is below C the Wi Fi availability is above A usage of PDCP data or MAC data would not be more efficient and usage of any technique is allowed.

In 3 PDCP data may be used to conduct switching or aggregation. PDCP data may be used given that the congestion index is below C the Wi Fi availability is above A usage of IP data or MAC data would not be more efficient and usage of any technique is allowed.

In 4 MAC data may be used to conduct switching or aggregation. MAC data may be used given that the congestion index is below C the Wi Fi availability is between Aand A usage of IP data or PDCP data would not be more efficient and usage of any technique is allowed.

At step cellular conditions such as LTE conditions may be measured. Furthermore requirements such as throughput for the cellular conditions may be determined or measured. Such conditions may include for example LTE congestion. It may be determined whether LTE congestion meets certain benchmarks. If so in step it may be determined that switching may be used to ameliorate the conditions. In another example it may be determined whether a given endpoint in system requires higher throughput to a destination. If so in step it may be determined that aggregation may be used to ameliorate the conditions. If switching or aggregation would not be useful then method proceed to step . If switching or aggregation would be useful then method may proceed to step .

In step non cellular channel conditions such as Wi Fi conditions may be measured. Such conditions may include measuring average Wi Fi channel idle time probability of successful transmission or number of active Wi Fi users. The availability of Wi Fi may be quantified.

In step it may be determined whether available Wi Fi may meet the requirements of switching and aggregation as determined at least in part by LTE congestion or requirements. If not method may proceed to step . If so method may proceed to step . In step existing transmissions may be maintained. Method may repeat at step .

In step affected endpoints and data links associated with the proposed switching or aggregation may be selected. In step an appropriate cellular data layer for switching or aggregation may be selected. Such a cellular data layer may include application level IP packets for LTE or an LTE sublayer such as MAC or PDCP. The selection of an appropriate layer may be made considering determinations made in for example steps and .

In step affected endpoints may be informed of the aggregation and switching decision as well as the cellular layer at which data will be encapsulated. In step cellular data such as LTE data may be selected from the determined layer. Such LTE data may be in the form of PDUs associated with the determined layer. In step the selected LTE data may be encapsulated in the payload of non cellular wireless data such as Wi Fi data. In step the Wi Fi data may be transmitted across a Wi Fi link. In parallel cellular data such as LTE data may be transmitted across an LTE link. In step the cellular data such as LTE data may be reassembled into a data stream. In step the resulting data stream may be sent to the intended recipient. Method may repeat at step .
