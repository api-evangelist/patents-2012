The present application is a non provisional application of co pending U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61 446 521 filed Feb. 25 2012 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used imported sold and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment or any royalty thereon or therefor.

The present invention provides a non faceted nanoparticle reinforced metal matrix composite having increased ductility while maintaining strength. In particular a non faceted nanoparticle reinforced metal matrix composite is provided comprised of spherical or ellipsoidal shaped non faceted nanoparticles comprising one or more of boron carbide titanium diboride silicon nitride alumina and boron nitride and a nanostructured matrix composite comprised of one or more metals and or metal alloys. In addition a method of manufacturing such a non faceted nanoparticle reinforced metal matrix composite is provided.

Particulate reinforced aluminum matrix composites have high strength high modulus lightweight good performance at high temperature excellent fatigue resistance creep resistance and abrasion resistance. The properties of the matrix composites are determined by the reinforcing candidates and by the microstructure of the matrix. Boron carbide BC is a good reinforcing candidate for the aluminum matrix composite ranking third in hardness just after diamond and cubic boron nitride and having a low density of 2.51 g cm lighter than Al . The microstructure of the matrix is also important to the overall properties of the composites such as the gain size of the matrix material. For example for a monolithic metal alloy the strength of the alloy increases with the decreasing of the grain size. Thus if a nanostructured Al matrix is achieved the strength of the composite material can be further improved.

Al based composite with the nanostructured Al matrix reinforced by the hard BC particles can be fabricated via cryomilling. Nanostructured material is material with a microstructure the characteristic length of which is on the order of a few typically 1 550 nanometers. Microstructure refers to the chemical composition the arrangement of the atoms the atomic structure and the size of a solid in one two or three dimensions. Nanostructured materials have received increasing attention due to their superior physical and mechanical properties. They are used in the electronic industry telecommunication electrical magnetic structural optical catalytic drug delivery and in consumer goods.

Nanostructured materials have generally conventionally been produced by 1 powder metallurgy 2 deposition to bulk nanostructured materials and 3 structural refinement by severe plastic deformation. In powder metallurgy processes nanostructured materials are commonly made via mechanical milling of powder and subsequent consolidation of the powder into bulk material. There are several disadvantages with this approach. For example contamination is unavoidable during consolidation.

Modification of these methods however can lead to the development of processes that are more practical. For instance it has been reported that mechanical milling under liquid nitrogen can prevent the powders from being severely oxidized from air and small nitride or oxy nitride particles which are within the size of 2 10 nm are produced in situ during milling. These inclusions including precipitates dispersoids and constituent particles as they are called can both strengthen the metal and enhance the thermal stability i.e. control the gain growth of the nanostructured materials. As another example if the temperature and or period to consolidate nanostructured powders into fully dense bulk materials can be reduced severe grain growth can be suspended and thus the nanostructure can again be retained.

With chemical processes nanostructured materials are created from a reaction with organometallics that precipitate particles of varying sizes and shapes. The process can however introduce excess carbon and or nitrogen into the final composition. An alternative approach is the solution gelation sol gel process where ceramic product ion is similar to organometallic processes except sol gel materials may be either organic or inorganic. Both approaches involve a high cost of raw materials and capital equipment limiting their commercial acceptance.

Physical or thermal processing involves the formation and collection of nanoparticles through the rapid cooling of a supersaturated vapor gas phase condensation see U.S. Pat. No. 5 128 081 . Thermal processes create the supersaturated vapor in a variety of ways including laser ablation plasma porch synthesis combustion flame exploding wires spark erosion electron beam evaporation sputtering ion collision . In laser ablation for example a high energy pulsed laser is focused on a target containing the material to be processed. The high temperature of the resulting plasma greater than 10 000 K vaporizes the material quickly allowing the process to operate at room temperature. The process is capable of producing a variety of nanostructured materials on the laboratory scale but it has the disadvantage of being extremely expensive due to the inherent energy inefficiency of lasers and therefore is not suitable for industrial scale production.

Mechanical milling has been widely used to fabricate nanostructured metal powder and powder for metal matrix composites. However it can be difficult to obtain nanostructured aluminum alloys with conventional mechanical milling because of the high recrystallization rate due to the low melting temperature of aluminum. Cryogenic milling or cryomilling is a modified mechanical milling technique where the mechanical milling is carried out at cryogenic temperatures usually in liquid nitrogen or a similar chilled atmosphere. Cryomilling has been employed to successfully fabricate nanostructured aluminum alloy powders and powders for aluminum metal matrix composites which exhibit good thermal stability because the cryogenic temperature retards the recovery of the aluminum. Strain is accumulated during cryomilling leading to dislocation activity ultimately causing the formation of nanoscaled grains within the cryomilled powder.

The combined effect of the ultra fine dispersion of particles formed during cryomilling and the reduced grain size is a powder that can be used to make a bulk material with relatively high strength. This type of material will also exhibit better creep resistance compared to its conventional counterpart. It has been reported that cryomilled aluminum alloys and aluminum metal matrix composite powders have nanoscaled structures with very good thermal stability. Also cryomilling can be easily scaled up to produce tonnage quantities. Thus cryomilling is one of the few processing approaches available for the fabrication of large quantities of nanostructured metal powders.

The nanostructured powders described above must be consolidated into bulk materials. Traditional consolidation approaches such as hot pressing HP hot isostatic pressing HIP and cold isostatic pressing CIP have been employed for consolidation into bulk materials. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0065173 to Fritzmeier et al. discloses aluminum alloy produced by blending aluminum with two other metals by cryomilling. The cryomilled alloy is subsequently consolidated by HIP. These consolidation methods require other gases to improve the efficiency of consolidation. Further these traditional consolidation approaches need very high pressures on the order of GPa which is provided by high pressure argon and long cycle time that can last for several hours.

Cryomilling has been demonstrated to provide a homogeneous distribution of the BC in the Al matrix and a good interface between the BC and the Al matrix. However the BC Al nanocomposite fabricated by cryomilling and subsequent consolidation approach exhibited limited ductility despite the high strength. Therefore there is a need for a strong yet highly ductile reinforced metal matrix composite and a process for making such particulate reinforced matrix composites.

Nanometric 50 nm BC reinforced Al composited were prepared via cryomilling in liquid nitrogen for 12 hours to ensure dispersion of target composition of vol. 4.7 wt. BC in an Al 5083 matrix. After cryomilling powders were v blended for the 70 30 composition canned and hot vacuum degassed. Subsequent to degassing materials were hot isostatic pressed HIPped and low strain rate extruded LSRE at 400 C. at UC Davis.

For quasi static acute over 10 s compression tests cylindrical coupons of approximately 6 mm diameter 8 mm height were machined and polished via conventional lathe. Testing was performed on an Instron 8801 test frame equipped with a standard video extensometer for strain measurement. Since strain cannot be measured directly on the coupon witness marks were made on tungsten carbide platens directly adjacent to the actual specimen to minimize compliance effects . Platens were lubricated to minimize barreling of the specimens.

SEM samples were prepared using a JEOL SM 09010 ion cross sectional polisher and imaged on an FBI XL30 SEM. TEM samples were prepared using a Gatan Ion mill and imaged on a Philips CM 12 at 100 kV.

The results of these stress vs. strain tests as well as the stress vs. strain tests shown in the Figures herein illustrated that nano BC reinforced Al composites comprised of cryomilled and unmilled Al particles were more ductile while retaining higher strength in comparison to 100 cryomilled Al 5083 and conventional Al 5083 that were not reinforced with nanoparticles. Further it was discovered that extrusion provided a more desirable composite than forging. Lastly it was discovered that the shape of the nanoparticles i.e. spherical or ellipsoidal is an important factor in providing increased strength and ductility to the composite.

Further as shown in five different composites were prepared and specimens of each were threaded cylindrical ASTM 8 subsize with 0.125 diameter 0.5 gauge section. Then the tensile strength of these five different composite samples was measured via engineering stress vs. engineering strain tests conducted on Instron 8801 universal testing machine equipped with standard video extensometer. As illustrated in the nano reinforced composites 70 30 nano BC according to the present invention exhibited sufficient tensile strength over a much broader range of applied strain.

In addition four nano BC reinforced Al composites of the present invention were prepared and subjected to similar strain rate jump tests at 10 s 10 s 10 s 10 s 10 s 10 s 10 s 10 s 10 s 10 s and 10 s respectively at a temperature of 200 C. The results of these tests are graphed in . As shown therein the composites of the present invention exhibited unexpectedly high tensile strength over a wide range of applied stress even at an elevated temperature of 200 C.

Although specific embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed herein those having ordinary skill in the art will understand that changes can be made to the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the scope of the invention is not to be restricted to the specific embodiments. Furthermore it is intended that the appended claims cover any and all such applications modifications and embodiments within the scope of the present invention
