Consumer automobiles and other motor vehicles can be equipped with an emergency event reporting service such as ONSTAR . These services are usually offered as an option and thus require payment of additional purchase and subscription fees. In addition these services commonly route emergency communications through a centralized operator who may or may not be located anywhere near the vehicle.

While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood however that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives consistent with the present disclosure and the appended claims.

In the following description numerous specific details such as logic implementations opcodes means to specify operands resource partitioning sharing duplication implementations types and interrelationships of system components and logic partitioning integration choices are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be appreciated however by one skilled in the art that embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced without such specific details. In other instances control structures gate level circuits and full software instruction sequences have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art with the included descriptions will be able to implement appropriate functionality without undue experimentation.

References in the specification to one embodiment an embodiment an example embodiment etc. indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature structure or characteristic but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature structure or characteristic. Moreover such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further when a particular feature structure or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature structure or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.

Embodiments of the invention may be implemented in hardware firmware software or any combination thereof. Embodiments of the invention implemented in a computer system may include one or more bus based interconnects between components and or one or more point to point interconnects between components. Embodiments of the invention may also be implemented as instructions carried by or stored on a transitory or non transitory machine readable medium which may be read and executed by one or more processors. A machine readable medium may be embodied as any device mechanism or physical structure for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computing device . For example a machine readable medium may be embodied as read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices mini or micro SD cards memory sticks electrical signals and others.

In the drawings specific arrangements or orderings of schematic elements such as those representing devices modules instruction blocks and data elements may be shown for ease of description. However it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the specific ordering or arrangement of the schematic elements in the drawings is not meant to imply that a particular order or sequence of processing or separation of processes is required. Further in general elements depicted with dashed lines are considered optional in at least some embodiments. However that is not to imply that elements that are not depicted with dashed lines are required in all embodiments. To the contrary the inclusion of a schematic element in a drawing is not meant to imply that such element is required in all embodiments or that the features represented by such element may not be included in or combined with other elements in some embodiments.

In general schematic elements used to represent instruction blocks may be implemented using any suitable form of machine readable instruction such as software or firmware applications programs functions modules routines processes procedures plug ins applets widgets code fragments and or others and that each such instruction may be implemented using any suitable programming language library application programming interface API and or other software development tools.

Similarly schematic elements used to represent data or information may be implemented using any suitable electronic arrangement or structure such as a register data store table record array index hash map tree list graph file of any file type folder directory database and or others.

Further in the drawings where connecting elements such as solid or dashed lines or arrows are used to illustrate a connection relationship or association between or among two or more other schematic elements the absence of any such connecting elements is not meant to imply that no connection relationship or association can exist. In other words some connections relationships or associations between elements may not be shown in the drawings so as not to obscure the disclosure. Also for ease of illustration a single connecting element may be used to represent multiple connections relationships or associations between elements. For example where a connecting element represents a communication of signals data or instructions it should be understood by those skilled in the art that such element may represent one or multiple signal paths e.g. a bus as may be needed to effect the communication.

Referring now to portions of an illustrative system for communicating emergency event information to an emergency responder computing device are embodied in an in vehicle computing device one or more mobile computing devices and an emergency service computing device which may be in communication with one another via one or more networks . An event manager at the in vehicle computing device generates an emergency notification in response to one or more indicators that a collision break in health related emergency or other emergency event has occurred at the in vehicle computing device . Such indicators may include for example signals or other inputs generated by one or more sensors a navigation system a crash management system an occupant monitoring system and or any other on board vehicle computer system e.g. an anti lock braking system traction control system in vehicle information system and or others as explained further below.

The event manager sends the emergency event notification to the network for receipt by one or more of the mobile computing devices using in some embodiments a pre existing wireless communication or transport protocol that is suitable for relatively short or medium distance wireless communications. In some embodiments the mobile computing devices are unpaired with respect to the non emergency vehicle e.g. they are not otherwise in communication with the in vehicle computing device but they are sufficiently within proximity of the non emergency vehicle to receive the notification through wireless communication. For mobile computing devices that are in proximity to the non emergency vehicle the event manager connects or pairs them with an emergency channel e.g. a radio frequency dedicated to emergency communications so that the mobile communication devices can forward the emergency event notification to the emergency service computing device .

A notification forwarder at the one or more mobile computing devices forwards the emergency event notification to the emergency service computing device via the emergency communications channel with which it is paired. In some embodiments the emergency event notification is configured by the event manager so that its receipt and forwarding by the mobile computing devices occurs with minimal or no disruption to the normal use of the mobile computing device . For instance in some embodiments the emergency event notification is embodied as a coded message of only a few data packets or less in size. At the emergency service computing device a notification manager decodes the emergency event notification to obtain therefrom information about the location of the non emergency vehicle . With that information the notification manager routes the emergency event notification to one or more of the emergency responder computing devices that are in proximity to the non emergency vehicle so that emergency responders such as police fire ambulance and or others associated with the emergency responder computing devices in proximity to the non emergency vehicle can respond to the emergency event involving the non emergency vehicle . In this way emergency communications can be localized to the geographic area that is in proximity to the vehicle that has been involved in an emergency event or at which an emergency event has occurred. In addition automated emergency notifications may be generated even when vehicle owners do not subscribe to a proprietary emergency service. In addition since more than one mobile computing device can be used to forward the emergency notifications the validity and or reliability of the emergency notifications may be improved.

In the illustrative embodiments the in vehicle computing device is associated with a non emergency vehicle such as a passenger car or other powered vehicle . In some embodiments the in vehicle computing device is embodied as an embedded system of the non emergency vehicle such as an in vehicle information or infotainment system IVI or other in vehicle computer system. As such the in vehicle computing device may be installed in the non emergency vehicle during manufacture or assembly of the non emergency vehicle or thereafter e.g. as an after market product .

The illustrative in vehicle computing device is operably coupled to the non emergency vehicle so that data indicating whether the non emergency vehicle has or has not experienced an emergency event such as an impact from or collision with another vehicle or object flat tire glass breaking or sliding off the road for example can be received by the event manager of the in vehicle computing device . The data indicating whether the non emergency vehicle has or has not experienced an emergency event may be obtained via one or more of the sensors which may be embodied as any device or mechanism by which an emergency event occurring at the non emergency vehicle can be detected. For example one or more of the sensors may be embodied as a sensor located on or coupled to an exterior surface of the non emergency vehicle such as an impact or force sensor on a bumper a force sensor located in the vehicle cabin such as a force sensor located in a seat configured to detect whether the seat is occupied or whether a seatbelt is in use a pressure sensor located in a vehicle tire a sensor coupled to a brake or accelerator pedal an airbag deployment sensor and or other sensors normally or customarily installed in the non emergency vehicle . In any event the sensors provide an indication e.g. by voltage output or a lack of voltage output for example in response to the non emergency vehicle experiencing an emergency event.

In some embodiments the data indicating whether the non emergency vehicle is or is not experiencing an emergency event may be obtained from one or more of the navigation system crash management system occupant monitoring system and or other vehicle computing systems. For example in some embodiments the occupant monitoring system may process the inputs from seat force sensors determine the number of occupants in the vehicle and or whether the occupants are wearing seatbelts and provide the number of occupants and or seat belt information to the event manager . As another example in some embodiments the crash management system may process the inputs from exterior impact sensors determine that a head on collision has occurred and provide the nature of the emergency event e.g. head on collision to the event manager . As a further example in some embodiments the navigation system may determine that the non emergency vehicle is no longer traveling on a road or is traveling at a very high or very low rate of speed in a certain direction and provide such information to the event manager . Alternatively or in addition in some embodiments user inputs to an in vehicle computing system such as pressing the hazard button on the vehicle dash or health information related to the driver or another vehicle occupant such as sensor data indicating that the driver may be falling asleep may be provided to the event manager .

The illustrative event manager processes the emergency event information generated by the sensors and or one or more of the navigation system crash management system occupant monitoring system and or other in vehicle computer systems and generates one or more notifications relating to the emergency event that has occurred.

For example all or portions of the emergency service computing device may be embodied in or as a desktop computer an enterprise computer system a network of computers an Internet enabled hosting service or other electronic device system or combination of any of the foregoing which is capable of facilitating the communication of emergency event notifications to emergency responders as described herein.

A notification manager resides at the emergency service computing device and is configured to via communication circuitry facilitate the routing of emergency event notifications from mobile computing devices to emergency responder computing devices in some embodiments. The notification manager is embodied as software and or computerized instructions that reside in a data storage device and or memory of the emergency service computing device . Aspects of the notification manager are described in further detail below with reference to . While not specifically shown it should be understood that the illustrative emergency service computing device includes at least one processor a memory an input output I O subsystem and at least one storage device and may include one or more peripheral devices as well as the communication circuitry . Generally speaking such components of the emergency service computing device are similar or analogous to devices with the same name described above.

The illustrative notification manager is configured to route emergency event notifications to emergency responder computing devices via a network which may include one or more emergency channels. In some embodiments the emergency responder computing device may be embedded in or otherwise associated with an emergency vehicle such as a police car fire truck ambulance or other emergency responder . The illustrative emergency responder computing device includes communication circuitry and a locating system . In general such components of the emergency service computing device are similar or analogous to devices with the same name described above. For instance the locating system may keep track of the geographic location of the emergency responder computing device and such information e.g. latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates may be transmitted to the notification manager via the communication circuitry .

The networks may be embodied as any type of wireless telecommunications network. Portions of the networks may be embodied as or otherwise include one or more public or private cellular networks telephone Digital Subscriber Line DSL or cable networks local or wide area networks publicly available global networks e.g. the Internet or any combination thereof. For example in some embodiments the networks may be embodied as or otherwise include a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM cellular network. Additionally the networks may include any number of additional devices as needed to facilitate communication between or among the in vehicle computing device the mobile computing device the emergency service computing device and the emergency responder computing device such as routers switches intervening computers and or others. Any suitable communication protocol e.g. TCP IP or WiMAX may be used to effect communication over the networks depending on for example the particular type or configuration of the networks . In particular at least a portion of the networks include an emergency communications channel e.g. a radio frequency that is dedicated to emergency use or which can be quickly cleared in the event of an emergency. Such channels may be maintained by federal state municipal or local governments or by private operators for example.

In general the components of the in vehicle computing device the mobile computing device the emergency service computing device and the emergency responder computing device are communicatively coupled as shown in by one or more signal paths. Such signal paths may be embodied as any type of wired or wireless signal paths capable of facilitating communication between the respective devices. For example the signal paths may be embodied as any number of wires printed circuit board traces via bus point to point interconnects intervening devices and or the like. Also generally speaking some of the components of the computing devices described above may be incorporated on a motherboard while other components may be communicatively coupled to the motherboard via for example a peripheral port.

Referring now to computerized modules of the illustrative event manager notification forwarder and notification manager are shown. Any or all such modules may be implemented in software hardware or a combination thereof. Dashed arrows are used to indicate communication of an emergency event notification from the in vehicle computing device through the mobile computing device s to the emergency service computing device . The illustrative event manager is embodied as computerized modules e.g. logic and or instructions including a notification generator an event monitor and a mobile device proximity analyzer . The illustrative event monitor analyzes indications e.g. electrical signals or other inputs received from one or more of the sensors the navigation system the crash management system the occupant monitor and or other in vehicle computer systems that the non emergency vehicle has experienced an emergency event. If the non emergency vehicle has experienced an emergency event the event monitor interfaces with the notification generator to prepare an emergency event notification. In the illustrative embodiment the emergency event notification is embodied as a code or bit string that represents a number of different pieces of data about the non emergency vehicle and the data and time that the emergency event has occurred. For example in some embodiments the data encoded in the emergency event notification may include an indicator of the location e.g. Global Positioning System coordinates the data and time that the emergency event occurred the year make model and or Vehicle Identification Number VIN of the non emergency vehicle an indicator of the vehicle state e.g. whether the non emergency vehicle s engine is running or whether the non emergency vehicle is moving an indicator of whether any airbags in the vehicle have deployed an indicator of the number of occupants in the vehicle and or whether seat belts were in use and or other data related to the non emergency vehicle . For instance each type of data and its current value may be represented by one or more digits positions in a numeric or alphanumeric string e.g. as a vector . In any event the emergency event notification is configured to have a small size e.g. a few data packets or less so that it can be processed by mobile computing devices with minimal or no impact on the normal operation of the mobile computing device .

The mobile device proximity analyzer uses location based services or GPS services to locate mobile computing devices that are in proximity to the non emergency vehicle . In some embodiments the mobile device proximity analyzer analyzes the locations of mobile computing devices and compares those locations to the location of the non emergency vehicle as determined based on information generated by the navigation system e.g. GPS coordinates or a GPS application running on a mobile computing device located in the non emergency vehicle . However in some embodiments the mobile device proximity analyzer simply allows the proximity to be defined by the normal range of the communications transport medium being employed e.g. WIFI BLUETOOTH DECT and or others . In response to the occurrence of an emergency event at the non emergency vehicle and the locating of one or more mobile computing devices in proximity to the non emergency vehicle the notification generator generates the encoded emergency event notification and sends it to one or more of the mobile computing devices via the network .

At the mobile computing devices that receive the emergency event notification a notification transmitter receiver of the notification forwarder transmits the emergency notification to the emergency service computing device via an emergency channel of the network as mentioned above. In the illustrative embodiments the emergency event notification is configured e.g. small packet size so that receipt and retransmission by the mobile computing devices is substantially imperceptible to the users of the mobile computing devices . In other embodiments an alert or other type of notification may be issued at the mobile computing device to indicate to the user of the mobile computing device that the device is being used briefly to forward emergency event information to an emergency responder. At the emergency service computing device the illustrative notification manager is embodied as computerized modules including a notification decoder a responder proximity analyzer a notification router and a policies database .

The illustrative notification decoder analyzes the emergency event notification signal and extracts the information relating to the non emergency vehicle and the emergency event described above. The illustrative responder proximity analyzer operates in similar fashion to the mobile device proximity analyzer but to determine e.g. based on data provided by the locating system which emergency responder computing devices are in proximity to the non emergency vehicle that has been involved in an emergency event or at which an emergency event has occurred e.g. by comparing GPS coordinates . The notification router sends the emergency event data decoded by the notification decoder to one or more emergency responder computing devices that are located in a desired proximity to the non emergency vehicle . In the illustrative embodiments one or more policies may be used to determine an appropriate degree of proximity based on one or more aspects of the notification signal the non emergency vehicle the location of the emergency vehicle associated with the emergency responder computing device and or other factors. For example if an emergency event involves a non emergency vehicle that is full of occupants the proximity may be defined more broadly to allow more emergency responders to respond.

Referring now to an illustrative method executable as computerized logic and or instructions by the event manager at the in vehicle computing device for example is shown. At block the method continuously monitors inputs received by the in vehicle computing device and determines whether an emergency event has occurred at the non emergency vehicle e.g. based on signals received from one or more of the sensors and or information provided by the navigation system crash management system occupant monitoring system and or other sources as described above. In the illustrative embodiment the monitoring continues until an emergency event occurs or the system is powered off. In response to an indication of an emergency event at block the method scans the network to identify and or locate one or more mobile computing devices that are in proximity to the non emergency vehicle . In the illustrative embodiment the mobile device proximity analyzer described above is configured to perform the tasks of block . As should be understood the location related information can be associated with a particular mobile computing device or a particular in vehicle computing device for that matter via a unique device identifier such as an International Mobile Equipment Identity IMEI Vehicle Identification Number VIN and or others.

If the method determines that more than one mobile computing device is in proximity to the non emergency vehicle at block computerized logic may be executed to select the nearest mobile computing device or devices for communication of the emergency event notification or to select a mobile computing device or devices based on one or more other factors. As described above the mobile computing devices in proximity to the non emergency vehicle may be determined by the transmission range of the wireless communication protocol being used. If no mobile computing devices are found at block the method returns to block and conducts another scan of the network . In some embodiments the method may adjust the parameters for determining proximity before resuming the search for mobile computing devices near the geographic location of the non emergency vehicle .

For mobile computing devices determined or found to be in proximity to the non emergency vehicle the method attempts to enable communication between the mobile computing device and the emergency service computing device over an emergency channel at block . In some embodiments the method may execute computerized logic to identify one or more emergency communications channels that have been cleared or are otherwise available for communication of the emergency event notification. The method identifies the emergency channel to the firmware device or more specifically to the notification forwarder . If at block the pairing of a mobile computing device with an emergency channel has completed successfully the method proceeds to block . If the pairing did not complete successfully the method returns to block and attempts another scan. In some embodiments the scan of block and or the pairing of block may be terminated or temporarily suspended after a number of unsuccessful attempts or after a period of time has elapsed as may be determined according to the requirements of a particular design or implementation of the system .

At block the emergency notification generated by the in vehicle computing device relating to an emergency event occurring at or involving the non emergency vehicle is transmitted by the paired mobile computing devices to the emergency service computing device via the emergency channel of the network .

Referring now to an illustrative method executable as computerized logic and or instructions by the emergency service computing device is shown. At block the emergency event notification generated by the in vehicle computing device and forwarded by the mobile computing device s is received by the communication circuitry at the emergency service computing device . In some embodiments the emergency service computing device may receive multiple emergency event messages from different in vehicle computing devices . At block location data contained in or derived from the emergency event notification are resolved using computerized logic to determine the location of the emergency event determine whether more than one vehicle is involved in the emergency event and or whether multiple emergency events have occurred in close proximity to one another. In some embodiments triangulation may be applied to the location data to resolve the location of the emergency event or events. As discussed above in some embodiments the emergency event notification is decoded or deconstructed using computerized analytical techniques to obtain the data associated with the non emergency vehicle from which the notification originated and or other information included in the notification. In some embodiments the emergency event data obtained from the emergency event notification is analyzed using computerized logic and or techniques to attempt to determine whether the emergency event notification is a false alarm or a true emergency. For example in some embodiments a GPS or other geographic mapping software or service may be used to generate a map of the location identified in the emergency event notification. If the map indicates that the location is not a road or other location near where a vehicle can drive such as a house or office building for instance the method may at least preliminarily conclude that the emergency event notification is a false alarm and or wait for further notifications to verify the occurrence of the emergency event or may conclude based on geographic features of the area such as steep slopes or curvy roads that the emergency event notification is likely not a false alarm.

At block the method locates or identifies emergency responder computing devices that are in proximity to the geographic location of the emergency event as determined from the emergency event notification at block . Any or a combination of the methods discussed above for locating computing devices on a network e.g. via location based services GPS or transmission range may be used to find emergency responder computing devices . In the illustrative embodiments the emergency responder computing devices forward geographic location information generated by the locating system to the emergency service computing device for use in determining whether to notify the emergency responder computing device of the emergency event. In addition as noted above in some embodiments policy logic may be applied to the determination of which emergency responder computing devices to notify. For instance in some embodiments emergency responder computing devices that are nearest to the geographic location of the non emergency vehicle involved in an emergency event may be automatically notified while in other embodiments certain responders but not others may be notified based on information contained in or derived from the emergency event notification. For example if the emergency event notification indicates that a glass break sensor was activated at the non emergency vehicle but no force or impact sensors were activated policy logic may conclude that the emergency event likely involves a break in and not a collision and notify a police responder first or instead of a fire department. At block the method sends the emergency event information e.g. location vehicle identifying information and optionally other pertinent data relating to the emergency event as mentioned above to the emergency responder computing devices identified at block over an emergency channel of the network . It should be understood that the emergency service computing device and the emergency channels described herein or portions thereof may be embodied as pre existing emergency response services and communication channels or may be designed or developed specifically for use with the system .

The emergency event notification forwarder may be configured to receive from a non emergency vehicle in proximity to the mobile computing device a notification of an emergency event occurring at the non emergency vehicle and may transmit the notification of the emergency event over an emergency communications channel to at least one emergency responder. In an example the emergency event notification forwarder may be configured to receive and transmit the notification in a manner that is substantially imperceptible by a user of the mobile computing device. In an example the mobile computing device may be located in the non emergency vehicle. In an example the mobile computing device may be located outside the non emergency vehicle. In an example the mobile computing device may be prior to receiving the notification of an emergency event in communication with an in vehicle computing system of the non emergency vehicle. In an example the mobile computing device may be not otherwise in communication with an in vehicle computing system of the non emergency vehicle.

In another example a system for communicating emergency event notifications to one or more emergency responders may include an emergency service computing device. The emergency service computing device may be configured to receive from at least one mobile computing device a notification that an emergency event has occurred at a non emergency vehicle in proximity to the at least one mobile computing device determine from the notification the location of the non emergency vehicle and send the notification to at least one emergency responder computing device in proximity to the location of the non emergency vehicle.

In an example the emergency service computing device may include at least one data storage at least one processor and a notification manager embodied in the at least one data storage and executable by the at least one processor and the notification manager may determine the location of the non emergency vehicle based on location information included in the notification. In an example the notification manager may compare the location information relating to the non emergency vehicle to location information received from the at least one emergency responder computing device. In an example the notification manager may determine whether an emergency responder is in proximity to the non emergency vehicle based on at least one of the location make year model operating status airbag deployment status and number of occupants of the non emergency vehicle and or the date and time of the emergency event. In an example the emergency service computing device may be configured to receive a plurality of emergency event notifications from the at least one mobile computing device and may determine at least one of whether the emergency event notifications relate to a true emergency event whether the emergency event notifications relate to multiple emergency events at the same location and or whether the emergency event notifications relate to multiple emergency events occurring at different locations in close proximity.

In another example a method for communicating emergency information from a non emergency vehicle to an emergency responder may include receiving at an in vehicle computing device of the non emergency vehicle an indication that the non emergency vehicle has experienced an emergency event locating at least one mobile computing device in proximity to the non emergency vehicle pairing the at least one mobile computing device with a pre existing emergency communications channel and sending a notification that the non emergency vehicle has experienced an emergency event to an emergency responder computing device in proximity to the non emergency vehicle via the at least one mobile computing device. In an example the method may include receiving the notification at an emergency service computing device and may include decoding the notification to determine the geographic location of the non emergency vehicle. In an example the method may include sending information relating to at least one of the location make year or model of the non emergency vehicle the operating status of the non emergency vehicle the status of airbags deployable by the non emergency vehicle and the number of occupants in the non emergency vehicle to the emergency responder computing device.
