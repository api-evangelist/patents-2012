This application is a non provisional application of and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 475 135 filed on Apr. 13 2011 titled Push Payment Transactions to Mobile Number the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Since their commercial introduction to the United States in the 1920 s consumer use of payment cards such as credit cards debit cards and the like for facilitating financial transactions in many western societies has grown rapidly. For example as of 2010 there are an estimated 1.6 billion credit cards in use in the United States alone.

While payment card use has been widely adopted in some countries not everybody has or uses payment cards. For example credit card use is very limited in developing countries. For another example even in developed countries people may not use credit cards due to security concerns or credit problems. However with the increasing availability and use of mobile telephones especially in developing countries where credit card use is limited people without credit cards often have a mobile telephone. Like credit card users people with mobile telephones would like the advantages of performing financial transactions without the hand to hand exchange of actual currency.

There are numerous ways in which one person may transfer money to another person. For example the sender may directly deposit funds into a bank account of the recipient or may electronically transfer funds to a bank account of the recipient. However these techniques typically require the sender to have knowledge of personal or financial information of the recipient and fail to exploit the proliferance of and increasing computational power of mobile telephones.

Further mobile telephone operators such as Verizon Communications Inc. and AT T Inc. have the infrastructure for facilitating telephone calls between land and mobile telephones. However they typically do not have the infrastructure for performing the mechanics underlying many financial transactions an infrastructure which is often provided by payment processing networks such as those provided by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. It is thus desirable to integrate the mobile telephone systems with the payment processing networks. This integration is challenging however since payment processing networks are structured to operate using a 16 digit primary account number PAN where the first 6 digits identify an issuer of the card and the entire 16 digit PAN identifies an account associated with the customer whereas mobile telephone networks are structured to operate using a 10 digit telephone number.

Embodiments of the invention disclosed herein include systems and methods for routing messages using logically independent recipient identifiers.

One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising receiving from a sending institution an authorization request message at a server computer the authorization request message comprising a non financial institution identifier and a recipient identifier separate from the non financial institution identifier the non financial institution identifier identifying a non financial institution the recipient identifier being associated with a recipient wherein the authorization request message requests authorization for a transaction between a sender and the recipient determining by the server computer the non financial institution from a number of different non financial institutions routing the authorization request message to the non financial institution and receiving from the non financial institution and at the server computer an authorization response message the authorization response message indicating whether or not the transaction is approved or not approved.

Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a server computer comprising a processor and a storage element having instructions stored therein that when executed by the processor cause the server to perform operations including receiving from a sending institution an authorization request message the authorization request message comprising a non financial institution identifier and a recipient identifier separate from the non financial institution identifier the non financial institution identifier identifying a non financial institution the recipient identifier being associated with a recipient wherein the authorization request message requests authorization for a transaction between a sender and the recipient determining the non financial institution from a number of different non financial institutions routing the authorization request message to the non financial institution and receiving from the non financial institution an authorization response message the authorization response message indicating whether or not the transaction is approved or not approved.

Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising receiving at a sending institution server from a sender requesting authorization for a transaction between the sender and a recipient a recipient identifier associated with the recipient determining whether the recipient identifier is enrolled so that the recipient can receive transactions when the recipient identifier is determined to be enrolled receiving from an entity other than the sender a non financial institution identifier identifying a non financial institution generating an authorization request message comprising the recipient identifier and the non financial institution identifier separate from the recipient identifier and sending the authorization request message to authorize the transaction between the sender and a recipient.

Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a server computer comprising a processor and a storage element having instructions stored therein that when executed by the processor cause the server to perform operations including receiving from a sender requesting authorization for a transaction between the sender and a recipient a recipient identifier associated with the recipient determining whether the recipient identifier is enrolled so that the recipient can receive transactions when the recipient identifier is determined to be enrolled receiving from an entity other than the sender a non financial institution identifier identifying a non financial institution generating an authorization request message comprising the recipient identifier and the non financial institution identifier separate from the recipient identifier and sending the authorization request message to authorize the transaction between the sender and a recipient.

Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising receiving from a payment processing network a check enrollment message at a server computer the check enrollment message being directed to a recipient telephone number determining whether the recipient telephone number is enrolled to receive financial transactions and sending a response message from the server computer to the payment processing network indicating whether the recipient telephone is enrolled to receive financial transactions.

Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a server computer comprising a processor and a storage element having instructions stored therein that when executed by the processor cause the server to perform operations including receiving from a payment processing network a check enrollment message at a server computer the check enrollment message being directed to a recipient telephone number determining whether the recipient telephone number is enrolled to receive financial transactions and sending a response message from the server computer to the payment processing network indicating whether the recipient telephone is enrolled to receive financial transactions.

The following disclosure provides exemplary systems and methods for routing messages using logically independent recipient identifiers such as telephone numbers.

Various embodiments described herein may generally include two different processes. In the first process the system determines whether a recipient is enrolled such that the recipient may receive financial transactions via a recipient identifier. In the second process which is performed in the event the recipient is enrolled the system facilitates posting of the transaction.

Various embodiments are described for performing the first process. In some embodiments enrollment may be determined using SMS messaging between a payment processing network and a mobile network operator. In accordance with these embodiments a sending customer provides a recipient identifier such as the recipient s mobile telephone number to a sending institution e.g. a bank and initiates a transaction e.g. indicating an amount of money to be transferred to the recipient . The sending institution sends a check enrollment message to a payment processing network where the check enrollment message includes the recipient identifier. The payment processing network initiates an short message service SMS message using e.g. the recipient s mobile telephone number to the mobile network operator in a pre defined format. The SMS message gets routed to the correct mobile network operator as per the standard routing logic used over the mobile network operators.

On receiving the SMS message the mobile network operator checks the enrollment status of the recipient identifier and sends a response message to a mobile gateway hosted by the payment processing network. The response could indicate that the recipient is enrolled in which case the SMS message confirms enrollment and includes a bank identification number BIN uniquely assigned to the mobile network operator. Or the response could indicate that the recipient is not enrolled in which case the requested transaction may not be completed. In either case the SMS message received by the mobile network operator is not forwarded to the recipient mobile communication device.

Based on the SMS response message the payment processing network notifies the sending institution on the status of the recipients enrollment. If it is an un enrolled recipient the sending institution may notify the sending customer of such a status. For enrolled recipients the sending institution creates and submits a standard ISO 8583 message to the payment processing network. However the message has the recipient identifier in place of the primary account number PAN and the BIN assigned to the mobile network operator in a field separate from the recipient identifier. The payment processing network forwards the transaction to the mobile network operator after which the mobile network operator posts the transaction in a digital wallet linked to the recipient identifier and sends a response message to the payment processing network. The payment processing network forwards the response to the sending institution which may then provide a confirmation of transfer to the sending customer.

In other embodiments enrollment may be determined using a call switching entity. A call switching entity is a computer network that facilitates the routing of telephone calls between users of different telephone networks. The call switching entity includes records of telephone numbers and the mobile network operator that hosts or is otherwise associated with each telephone number. The call switching entity is thus in a unique position to identify mobile network operator associated with a recipient s mobile telephone number. The enrollment processing for these embodiments is similar to that already described with reference to SMS messaging. However in these embodiments instead of sending an SMS message to the mobile network operator the payment processing network sends a request to the call switching entity for the identity of the mobile network operator associated with the recipient s telephone number. The call switching entity may identify the mobile network operator associated with the recipient s telephone number and send the mobile network operator identifier to the payment processing network. In response the payment processing network then checks whether the recipient telephone number is enrolled to receive financial transactions.

Before discussing specific embodiments of the invention some descriptions of some specific terms are provided below.

A sending institution may be any entity with the capability to initiate a transaction e.g. a bank a money transfer facility like MoneyGram or any other entity authorized to transfer value.

A non financial institution may be a device system network or entity that facilitates communication between different electronic communication devices. For example a non financial institution may be a mobile network operator operable to facilitate wireless communication between mobile telephones.

A non financial institution identifier may be an identifier that uniquely identifies different non financial institutions. For example the non financial institution identifier may be a data string containing alphanumeric text a sequence of binary bits etc.

A recipient identifier may be an identifier that uniquely identifies a recipient of a transaction. The recipient identifier may be issued by a government a corporation or by some other type of entity. The recipient identifier may be e.g. a mobile communication device identifier a driver s license number a social security number a passport number a national identification number an e mail address a name used in instant messaging applications social networking applications or other types of software applications etc.

A mobile communication device identifier may be an identifier that uniquely identifies a mobile communication device. For example a mobile communication device identifier may be a phone number an IP address a MAC address etc.

A sender or sending customer may be a person business or other entity that desires to initiate a transaction such as a financial payment to a recipient.

A recipient may be a person business or other entity that receives a transaction such as a financial payment from a sender or sending customer.

A transaction request may be a request by a sender to perform a transaction such as a financial transaction or other transfer of value with a recipient. The transaction request may be a request to transfer funds from an account associated with the sender to an account associated with the recipient. The transaction request may include various information such as account information of the sender and or account information of the recipient. The account information of the recipient may include a mobile communication device identifier e.g. a mobile telephone number associated with the recipient.

A transaction response may be an electronic message reply to a transaction request which may include one or more of the following status indicators Approval transaction was approved Decline transaction was not approved or Call Center response pending more information sender or recipient must call a toll free authorization phone number.

An authorization request message may be a message that requests an issuer of an account associated with a recipient to authorize a transaction requested by a sender. The authorization request message may include a recipient mobile communication device identifier e.g. a mobile telephone number associated with the recipient and a mobile network operator identifier i.e. an identifier that uniquely identifies the mobile network operator on which the mobile communication device associated with the recipient operates . The authorization request message may also include other information such as transaction information and account information for the sender and or recipient.

In some embodiments the mobile wallet application may be an electronic wallet that can be used to conduct a transaction. A mobile wallet application may be used in a variety of transactions including but not limited to eCommerce social networks money transfer personal payments mobile commerce proximity payments gaming and or the like. For example consumers such as the sending customer may engage in eCommerce via the mobile wallet application for retail purchases digital goods purchases and utility payments via e.g. a mobile communication device identifier associated with the recipient of the transaction. Consumers may also for example use the mobile wallet application to purchase games or gaming credits from gaming websites and transfer funds to friends via social networks. Further for example consumers may also use the mobile wallet application on a smart phone such as mobile communication device for retail purchases buying digital goods NFC RF payments at point of sale POS terminals.

In an exemplary transaction involving an mobile wallet application a consumer may submit an indication to purchase or transfer funds. For example the consumer may visit a merchant website e.g. Facebook.com Amazon.com etc. and request to purchase an item from the website transfer funds to a friend and or the like. The merchant website may determine whether the electronic wallet is authorized on its website and may provide a list of payment options. If the merchant is registered with an electronic wallet server the electronic wallet server may authorize the merchant to collect consumer credentials for login to the electronic wallet and the merchant website may prompt the consumer to login to the electronic wallet. Otherwise the merchant website may request the consumer to provide payment details for alternative payment options e.g. credit card debit card PayPal account .

The consumer may authorize submission of their wallet consumer credentials such as but not limited to a Wallet Consumer ID a password and or the like. For example the consumer may enter the Wallet Consumer ID and password into a pop up window provided from the merchant website and or electronic wallet server. In another example the consumer may authorize the merchant website to provide the consumer credentials e.g. previously stored in HTML5 cookies etc. to the electronic wallet server. In yet another example the consumer may authorize the electronic wallet server via a remote component running on the merchant website e.g. a Java applet etc. to provide consumer credentials to the electronic wallet server for validation.

When the consumer submits consumer credentials to log into the electronic wallet the merchant website may forward the consumer credentials and transaction details to the electronic wallet server which may determine the validity of the consumer credentials. If the consumer s credentials are not valid the electronic wallet server may deny the payment request and send a notification of denial to the merchant website. In other embodiments if the consumer provided credentials are valid the electronic wallet server may process payment from the electronic wallet. For example the electronic wallet server communicates with the consumer s bank account associated with the electronic wallet and requests a fund transfer of an indicated amount. The electronic wallet server may then store a transaction record.

In some embodiments after processing the payment the electronic wallet server sends a payment confirmation notice to the merchant website which in turn completes the order and stores the transaction record in the database. The merchant website may provide a confirmation page comprising transaction confirmation to the consumer.

While the mobile wallet application is described primarily in reference to mobile communication device which itself is described as being associated with a recipient of a transaction one skilled in the art would recognize that the mobile wallet application may be provided on a computing device associated with sending customer . For example the mobile communication device depicted and described with reference to may also or alternatively be used by sending customer . For another example and with brief reference to the mobile wallet application may be stored in system memory and executed by central processor of a computer apparatus associated with sending customer .

The mobile communication device may further include a contactless element which is typically implemented in the form of a semiconductor chip or other data storage element with an associated wireless transfer e.g. data transmission element such as an antenna. Contactless element is associated with e.g. embedded within mobile communication device and data or control instructions transmitted via a cellular network may be applied to contactless element by means of a contactless element interface not shown . The contactless element interface functions to permit the exchange of data and or control instructions between the mobile device circuitry and hence the cellular network and an optional contactless element .

Contactless element is capable of transferring and receiving data using a near field communications NFC capability or near field communications medium typically in accordance with a standardized protocol or data transfer mechanism e.g. ISO 14443 NFC . Near field communications capability is a short range communications capability such as RFID Bluetooth infra red or other data transfer capability that can be used to exchange data between the mobile communication device and an interrogation device. Thus the mobile communication device is capable of communicating and transferring data and or control instructions via both cellular network and near field communications capability.

The mobile communication device can also include a processor e.g. a microprocessor for processing the functions of the mobile communication device and a display to allow a recipient to see phone numbers and other information and messages. The mobile communication device can further include input elements to allow a user to input information into the device a speaker to allow the user to hear voice communication music etc. and a microphone to allow the user to transmit her voice through the mobile communication device . The mobile communication device may also include an antenna for wireless data transfer e.g. data transmission via e.g. mobile gateway .

The various participants and elements e.g. the sending customer sending institution payment processing network mobile network operator mobile communication device and call switching entity in can operate one or more computer apparatuses e.g. a computing device associated with the sending customer to facilitate the functions described herein. Any of the elements in can use any suitable number of subsystems to facilitate the functions described in the systems and methods described in previous sections. Examples of such subsystems or components are shown in . The subsystems shown in are interconnected via a system bus . Additional subsystems such as a printer keyboard fixed disk or other memory comprising computer readable media monitor which is coupled to display adapter and others are shown. Peripherals and input output I O devices which coupled to I O controller can be connected to the computer system by any number of means known in the art such as serial port . For example serial port or external interface can be used to connect the computer apparatus to a wide area network such as the Internet a mouse input device or a scanner. The interconnection via system bus allows the central processor to communicate with each subsystem and to control the execution of instructions from system memory or the fixed disk as well as the exchange of information between subsystems. The system memory and or the fixed disk can embody a computer readable medium.

One of skill in the art would recognize that modifications additions or omissions may be made to system without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The components of system may be integrated or separated according to particular needs. For example although separate functional blocks are shown for a sending institution and a payment processing network some entities perform all of these functions and may be included in embodiments of invention. Moreover the operations of system may be performed by more fewer or other system modules. Additionally operations of system may be performed using any suitable logic comprising software hardware other logic or any suitable combination of the preceding.

In step S sending customer sends a transaction request to sending institution . The transaction request includes a recipient identifier e.g. a mobile communication device identifier such as a phone number of the desired recipient of the transaction. For example the recipient identifier may be a phone number associated with a desired recipient of a financial payment. The transaction request may also include other transaction information such as an amount of money to be transferred. The transaction request may be sent to the sending institution using one or more of a variety of techniques. In some embodiments sending customer verbally communicates the transaction request to sending institution . In other embodiments sending customer uses a computing device associated with sending customer . For example sending customer may use a computing device having a software application stored therein that enables the computing device to communicate transaction requests to sending institution. Upon receiving the transaction request sending institution may extract various information such as the transaction information from the transaction request and store it in database . Sending institution may also identify the sender account information associated with the sending customer or in the event the sender is not a pre existing customer may receive such information from the sending customer and store it in database via e.g. an API provided by the sending institution .

In step S sending institution generates and sends to payment processing network a check enrollment message . The check enrollment message includes the recipient identifier e.g. the phone number provided by sender and is a message that requests payment processing network to check to see whether the recipient identifier e.g. the phone number is enrolled to receive transactions. The check enrollment message may be generated by e.g. enrollment engine and sent to payment processing network via network interface .

In step S upon receiving the check enrollment message payment processing network generates a similar check enrollment message and sends the message to the recipient identifier in this case the phone number provided by the sending institution . The check enrollment message generated by payment processing network may not include the recipient identifier. According to one embodiment the check enrollment message is an SMS message generated by SMS messaging engine . For example enrollment engine may receive the check enrollment message from the sending institution and in response to receiving that message instruct the SMS messaging engine to generate an SMS message. The SMS message is a message that requests mobile network operator to check to see whether the recipient identifier is enrolled to receive transactions. After being generated the SMS message may be addressed to the recipient identifier received from sending institution and sent to mobile network operator via mobile gateway . In some embodiments the SMS message may include a transaction flag that indicates to mobile network operator that the SMS message concerns a financial transaction and should not be forwarded to the recipient.

In step S upon receiving the SMS message from payment processing network mobile network operator determines whether the recipient identifier e.g. phone number which the SMS message was addressed to is enrolled to receive financial transactions. For example enrollment engine may search database for a mobile communication device identifier that corresponds to the received phone number. Upon locating a matching mobile communication device identifier enrollment engine may determine whether an associated enrollment flag indicates that the phone number is enrolled or not enrolled. In this particular embodiment the enrollment engine determines that the associated enrollment flag indicates that the phone number is enrolled.

In some embodiments at step S mobile network operator may also determine whether or not to forward the received SMS message to a mobile communication device associated with the recipient identifier. For example mobile network operator may store the received SMS message in SMS message buffer . Message identification engine may then analyze the SMS message to determine whether or not it should forward the message to the recipient phone number which the message is addressed to. In analyzing the SMS message message identification engine may search for a transaction flag provided in or communicated with the SMS message where the transaction flag indicates that the SMS message concerns a financial transaction and should not be forwarded to the recipient. In the event message identification engine locates the transaction flag message identification engine prevents the SMS message from being forwarded to the mobile communication device associated with the mobile telephone number which the message is addressed to. Otherwise the SMS message may be forwarded to the mobile communication device.

In step S upon determining that the recipient s identifier is enrolled mobile network operator generates and sends an SMS response message back to payment processing network . For example enrollment engine may generate an SMS response message and send it back to payment processing network via mobile gateway . The SMS response message includes a mobile network operator identifier that uniquely identifies the mobile network operator . For example enrollment engine may read MNO identifier from database and include it in the SMS response message.

In step S payment processing network receives the SMS response message and generates and sends an enrollment status message to sending institution . For example enrollment engine may receive the SMS response message via mobile gateway . Enrollment engine may then generate and send the enrollment status message to sending institution via network interface . The enrollment status message is a message that indicates whether the recipient s identifier is enrolled to receive a financial transaction and includes the mobile network operator identifier included in the SMS response message.

In step S upon receiving an enrollment status message that indicates that the recipient s identifier is enrolled sending institution forms an authorization request message that operates to request authorization for a transaction between the sending customer and a recipient associated with the recipient identifier. The authorization request message may include the recipient identifier e.g. the recipient s phone number and the mobile network operator identifier. The authorization request message may also include other information such as transaction information e.g. an amount of money to be transferred and sender account information e.g. the sending customer s account number . In one embodiment message formatting engine extracts the mobile network operator identifier from the enrollment status message provided in step S and reads other information from sender account information and transaction information from database . Message formatting engine then uses this information to form the authentication request message. When forming the authentication request message messaging formatting engine may form the message such that the recipient identifier is separate from the mobile network operator identifier.

In step S sending institution sends the authorization request message to payment processing network . For example authorization engine may send the message via network interface .

In step S payment processing network identifies or otherwise determines the mobile network operator or other non financial institution that manages the recipient identifier e.g. the recipient s phone number . For example mobile network operator identification engine may read the MNO identifier included in the authorization request message and determine the mobile network operator from the MNO identifier.

In step S payment processing network routes the authorization request message to the mobile network operator identified by the MNO identifier. For example authorization engine may read the mobile network operator routing table stored in database and search the routing table for the identified mobile network operator. Upon finding a match authorization engine may read the network routes associated with the identified mobile network operator. Authorization engine may then route the authorization request message to the mobile network operator via network interface in accordance with the stored network route.

In step S mobile network operator posts the requested transaction to a mobile wallet associated with the recipient identifier included in the authorization request message. For example transaction posting engine may post the requested transaction to a mobile wallet associated with the recipient phone number.

The mobile wallet may be managed by a variety of suitable entities. In one embodiment the mobile wallet may be managed by mobile network operator . In such a case database may include account information associated with the recipient identifier. Transaction posting engine may search for and identify an account stored in database that corresponds to the recipient identifier and post the transaction to that account. In another embodiment the mobile wallet may be managed by an entity other that mobile network operator such as sending institution or other financial entity. Database may then also include recipient account information similar to sender account information but for the recipient . Transaction posting engine may then operate to securely communicate the transaction information to sending institution via network interface . Upon receipt sending institution may post the transaction into the recipient s account. In yet another embodiment the mobile wallet may be managed by the recipient mobile communication device . In this case transaction posting engine may securely communicate the transaction information to the recipient mobile communication device .

In response to posting the transaction the entity hosting the mobile wallet may generate an authorization response message. For example where the hosting entity is mobile network operator authorization engine may process the transaction and determine whether the transaction is approved declined etc. based on the transaction information and the recipient account information. For another example where the hosting entity is sending institution or other financial entity authorization engine may process the transaction and determine whether the transaction is approved. Upon determining whether the transaction is approved the entity hosting the mobile wallet may generate the authorization response message. In the event the entity hosting the mobile wallet is an entity other than mobile network operator the entity may send the authorization response message to the mobile network operator .

In some embodiments when the transaction is successfully posted to the mobile wallet the mobile wallet may be linked to an account associated with payment processing network . In such cases payment processing network may perform clearance and settlement functions for the transaction. For example clearing and settlement engine may perform transaction clearance and settlement functions for all successfully posted transactions on a nightly basis.

In step S mobile network operator may notify the recipient communication device associated with the recipient identifier of one or more of the transaction request and transaction response. For example authorization engine may communicate an SMS message to the mobile communication device by sending the SMS message to the recipient phone number via mobile gateway where the SMS message indicates that a transaction was requested and indicates whether the transaction was approved denied etc.

In step S mobile network operator sends the authorization response message to payment processing network . For example authorization engine may communicate the authorization response message to payment processing network via network interface .

In step S payment processing network forwards the authorization response message to the sending institution . For example authorization engine may receive and forward the authorization response message to sending institution via network interface .

In step S sending institution may receive the authorization response message and indicate to the sender the contents of the message. For example authorization engine may receive the authorization response message and either display the message to the sending customer located at sending institution or in some embodiments send the authorization response to the computing device used by the sending customer to request the transaction. In doing so sending institution provides a transaction response to the sending customer the transaction response indicating whether the requested transaction was approved denied etc.

Steps S to S are identical to steps S to S described with reference to and thus further description is omitted. In this embodiment however in step S instead of determining that the recipient identifier is enrolled to receive financial transactions mobile network operator determines that the recipient identifier is not enrolled to receive financial transactions. Accordingly mobile network operator proceeds to generate and send an SMS response message that indicates that the recipient identifier is not enrolled. As a result the transaction request is denied.

Steps S to S are similar to steps S to S described with reference to except in this case the SMS response message indicates that the recipient identifier e.g. the recipient s phone number is not enrolled and the transaction response message indicates that the transaction request was denied since the recipient identifier is not enrolled to receive financial transactions.

Steps S and S are identical to steps S to S described with reference to and thus further description is omitted. Step S is similar to S described with reference to however in this embodiment payment processing network sends a request for a mobile network operator identifier to call switching server . The request includes the recipient identifier received from sending institution . For example the request may be generated by enrollment engine and sent to call switching server via network interface .

In step S in response to receiving the request for an MNO identifier call switching server locates and sends the requested MNO identifier to payment processing network . For example MNO identification engine may search mobile communication device identifiers for a match with a mobile communication device. Upon locating a match MNO identification engine may read an MNO identifier associated with the matched mobile communication device identifier. Each MNO identifier may be associated with a number of mobile communication device identifiers where the mobile communication device identifiers e.g. mobile phone numbers are managed by the mobile network operator identified by the MNO identifier. Once MNO identification engine reads the MNO identifier associated with the mobile communication device identifier MNO identification engine may send the MNO identifier to payment processing network via network interface .

In step S payment processing network determines whether the recipient identifier is enrolled to receive financial transactions. Step S is similar to step S discussed with reference to however in this embodiment this functionality is performed by payment processing network rather than mobile network operator . Payment processing network may thus include all of the information and logic discussed with reference to mobile network operator performing step S such as enrollment flags and the like. In this particular embodiment the enrollment engine determines that the associated enrollment flag indicates that the recipient s phone number is enrolled.

Steps S to S are identical to steps S to S described with reference to and thus further description is omitted.

Steps S and S are identical to steps S to S described with reference to and thus further description is omitted. Steps S and S are identical to steps S and S described with reference to and thus further description is omitted. Step S is similar to step S described with reference to however in this case payment processing network determines that the recipient identifier is not enrolled. As a result payment processing network generates an enrollment status message indicating that the recipient identifier is not enrolled and sends this message to sending institution . Accordingly steps S and S are identical to steps S and S described with reference to and thus further description is omitted.

Embodiments of the invention are not limited to the above described embodiments. For example although separate functional blocks are shown for an issuer computer payment processing network and acquirer computer some entities perform all of these functions and may be included in embodiments of invention. Further although the methods described show stages or steps in a particular order embodiments of the invention may include some all or none of the recited steps in any combination without departing from the scope of the invention.

Though the above methods are described using the exemplary situation of a sending customer providing a recipient s mobile telephone number embodiments of the invention are not so limited. The sending customer may provide other suitable recipient identifiers as described herein. Further while the methods are described as pushing a financial transaction to a mobile wallet associated with a recipient s mobile telephone number embodiments of the invention are not so limited. For example the desired recipient of the transaction may be a merchant such as a provider of goods or services. The merchant may be issued a unique identifier such as a mobile communication device identifier that uniquely identifies the merchant where the merchant identifier is associated with a financial account such as a mobile wallet. For another example instead of being sent to a mobile network operator or call switching server the recipient identifier may be sent to a web server hosting a social networking application where the web server may post a transaction to an account associated with a user of the social networking application. Embodiments of the invention may thus facilitate not only person to person transactions but also person to merchant transactions via a variety of servers systems or networks that are in communication with and manage accounts of recipients.

A standard authorization request message shows the format of a typical message that may be communicated through a payment processing network. The standard message is typically a 16 digit primary account number PAN that operates to identify an account associated with a particular person or entity. The PAN includes an issuer identifier where the issuer identifier is typically the first 6 digits of the PAN and operates to identify an issuer of the account. In this case the PAN is not separate from the issuer identifier since at least one actually all digits of the issuer identifier form part of the PAN .

According to an embodiment one or more advantages of the present invention may be realized by logically separating the PAN into two components a recipient identifier and an issuer identifier to form an authorization request message . The recipient identifier operates to uniquely identify a person or entity that holds an account. For example the recipient identifier may be the mobile communication device identifier e.g. a telephone number . The issuer identifier which is separate from the recipient identifier operates to uniquely identify an issuer of the account. For example the issuer identifier may be the mobile network operator identifier. In at least some embodiments the authorization request message formed by sending institution in e.g. steps S and S may assume the form of the authorization request message . For example the sending institution may include the recipient phone number received from the sender as recipient identifier and may include the MNO identifier received from payment processing network as issuer identifier . In this case the recipient identifier is entirely separate or in other words logically independent from the issuer identifier . The recipient identifier may also be separate from also logically independent from the issuer identifier where some but not all of the digits of the issuer identifier are also used as the recipient identifier .

One skilled in the art would recognize that embodiments of the present invention are not narrowly limited to those explicitly described herein but also include various methods and apparatus associated with various other elements of the system depicted in .

For example one method comprises receiving from a payment processing network a check enrollment message at a server computer the check enrollment message being directed to a recipient identifier determining whether the recipient identifier is enrolled to receive financial transactions and sending a response message from the server computer to the payment processing network indicating whether the recipient identifier is enrolled to receive financial transactions. In some embodiments when it is determined that the recipient identifier is enrolled the server sends the mobile network operator identifier to the payment processing system. In some embodiments the check enrollment message is an SMS message and the response message is an SMS response message.

In some embodiments the method may further comprise analyzing the check enrollment message to determine whether it should be forwarded to the recipient. The method may further comprise receiving an authorization request message the authorization request message requesting authorization for a transaction between a sender and the recipient. The method may further comprise posting the transaction to a mobile wallet associated with the recipient identifier. In some embodiments posting the transaction includes sending the transaction to a mobile device associated with the recipient identifier sending the transaction to a financial entity associated with the recipient or recording the transaction in an account stored in a database of the server computer.
