Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and more particularly to wagering game machines providing a write once run anywhere environment.

Wagering game machine makers continually provide new and entertaining games. One way of increasing entertainment value associated with casino style wagering games e.g. video slots video poker video black jack and the like includes offering a variety of base games and bonus events. However despite the variety of base games and bonus events players often lose interest in repetitive wagering gaming content. In order to maintain player interest wagering game machine makers frequently update wagering game content with new game themes game settings bonus events game software and other electronic data.

In addition to the drive to provide a variety of different wagering games improved technology and consumer demand has led to the development of a variety of different hardware platforms and system software for the hardware platforms. In typical systems a wagering game is programmed such that it must run on a particular platform or system software. As a result wagering games must be ported e.g. translated to run on different hardware or system software. The porting or translation of a wagering game to run on an alternative platform can be a very expensive undertaking both in time and money.

The CPU is also connected to an input output I O bus which facilitates communication between the wagering game machine s components. The I O bus may vary in different architectures. For example in some architectures the bus is an ISA bus. In alternative architectures the bus may be a PC bus. The I O bus is connected to a payout mechanism primary display secondary display value input device player input device information reader NVRAM Non Volatile Random Access Memory and storage unit . The player input device can include the value input device to the extent the player input device is used to place wagers. The I O bus is also connected to an external system interface which is connected to external systems e.g. wagering game networks .

NVRAM may be any type of NVRAM that maintains data across reboots or power on off cycles of the wagering game machine.

Storage unit may be any type of persistent storage unit that maintains data across reboots or power on off cycles of the wagering game machine such that the data is persistent across reboots or power on off cycles. Examples of such storage units include hard disks CD ROM drives DVD ROM drives flash memory compact flash memory etc.

Some embodiments include an FPGA Field Programmable Array . In general an FP GA comprises a semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and programmable interconnects. The programmable logic components can be programmed to provide AND OR XOR NOT logic or more complex combinational functions such as decoders or simple math functions. The programmable logic components of an FPGA also referred to as logic blocks may also include memory elements.

Programmable interconnects allow the logic blocks of an FPGA to be interconnected in various ways. The logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed after the FPGA has been manufactured by a customer or designer so that the FPGA can perform whatever logical function is desired.

In some embodiments FPGA may be used to control peripherals . For example peripherals may comprise a set of lights for wagering game machine and the FPGA may be programmed to turn lights in the set on or off based on input received by the FPGA. In some embodiments the FPGA may have a version or revision level encoded on the FPGA.

In one embodiment the wagering game machine can include additional peripheral devices and or more than one of each component shown in . For example in one embodiment the wagering game machine can include multiple external system interfaces multiple storage units and or multiple CPUs . In one embodiment any of the components can be integrated or subdivided. Additionally in one embodiment the components of the wagering game machine can be interconnected according to any suitable interconnection architecture e.g. directly connected hypercube etc. .

In one embodiment any of the components of the wagering game machine can include hardware firmware and or software for performing the operations described herein. Machine readable media includes any mechanism that provides e.g. stores and or transmits information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a wagering game machine computer etc. . For example tangible machine readable media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory machines etc. Machine readable media also includes any media suitable for transmitting software over a network.

While describes example embodiments of a wagering game machine architecture shows a software architecture and the relationship of the software architecture to elements of a hardware architecture for a wagering game machine.

According to another example embodiment one or more of the software components may be provided as part of the operating system or other software used in the wagering game system e.g. libraries daemons common services etc. .

Storage unit may provide various services where the services provide an interface . In general services comprise software that provides an abstraction for a device or set of functions provide on a wagering game machine. For example a service may provide an abstraction for a video device. The software running on the service may emulate functions that are not provided natively by a video card on the wagering game machine while allowing the video card to handle those functions that it can handle. For example assume that services . and . provide an abstraction of video services. Service . may be run in one configuration for one type or version of a video card while service . may be run when a different version or type of video card is present. One of the video cards may provide a rendering engine while the other does not. In either case the interface . provided by services . and . may be sane interface where one of the services provides rendering software to make up for the lack of a rendering engine in one of the video cards. Thus the software components of the framework may only need to provide an interface to the service and may run the same way regardless of the capabilities or API Application Programming Interface of the underlying video hardware.

Similarly services . and . may provide an abstraction for other functions such as communications functions while services . and . may provide an abstraction for sound or audio services. Again the interface provided for a family of services is the same the underlying service that is run handles the variations in the hardware that is present in varying implementations.

A service may be implemented as a daemon process or other background processing mechanism provided by operating system . An wagering game application or software component may communicate with a service using any of a variety of interprocess communications IPC mechanisms including sockets queues named pipes message queues shared memory etc.

In some embodiments a configuration module may be executed to determine at runtime what hardware is present and determine which services should be executed based on the presence or absence of particular hardware. The services are initialized and run. In the example shown in services . and . have been selected for execution based on the hardware present.

Although configuration module is shown as part of operating system configuration module may run at the application level rather than the operating system level in some embodiments.

Additionally the example illustrated in shows two versions of services from each family A B or C where a family of services provides an abstraction for a particular function video audio communications security etc. and where each service handles a particular hardware implementation for the service. It should be noted that more than two services may be provided to account for more than two hardware implementations.

Various mechanisms may be used to detect hardware including querying a device driver for the hardware status detecting the presence of a USB peripheral attempting to open a hardware device querying a configuration memory for the system etc. The embodiments are not limited to a particular method of detecting the presence or absence of a hardware module.

Next at block a hardware configurations is determined based on the presence or absence of the hardware modules or hardware characteristics determined a block . Various combinations of the presence or absence of hardware modules may be used to determine or infer a particular hardware architecture version or configuration.

At block a set of one or more services are selected based on the hardware configuration determined at block . The selected services are then initialized e.g. run in order to make them available to wagering game applications or other applications that may run on a wagering game machine.

As will be appreciated from the above the systems and methods described above provide a write once run anywhere environment for a wagering game machine. Wagering game applications may be designed to use the abstracted interface provided by services and the services may be instantiated based on a hardware configuration that is determined at run time based on the presence or absence of particular hardware.
