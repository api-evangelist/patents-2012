This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Contract No. N00019 02 C 3003 awarded by the United States Navy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to a turbine engine. In particular the invention relates cooling turbine airfoils in a gas turbine engine.

A turbine engine ignites compressed air and fuel to create a flow of hot combustion gases to drive multiple stages of turbine blades. The turbine blades extract energy from the flow of hot combustion gases to drive a rotor. The turbine rotor drives a fan to provide thrust and drives a compressor to provide a flow of compressed air. Vanes interspersed between the multiple stages of turbine blades align the flow of hot combustion gases for an efficient attack angle on the turbine blades.

Rotors and vanes each typically include an airfoil and at least one platform from which the airfoil extends. Combustion gases flowing past airfoils tend to form vortices at the platform surface. Such vortices waste useful energy and reduce the efficiency of the turbine engine. Turbine engines may include rotor or vane airfoils that are curved or bowed to improve the efficiency of the turbine engine by directing the combustion gases away from platforms at the ends of the airfoils thereby reducing the vortices.

Rotor and vane airfoils are exposed to high temperature combustion gases and must be cooled to extend their useful lives. Cooling air is typically taken from the flow of compressed air. A portion of the cooling air passes through and cools the airfoil before discharging through cooling discharge openings at a trailing edge of the airfoil. The cooling air discharging from these openings cools the trailing edge. Airfoil trailing edges are made as thin as practical for improved aerodynamic efficiency. Such thin trailing edges limit the cross sectional area available at the trailing edge for cooling discharge openings. Thus turbine airfoils may have cooling discharge openings at the trailing edge that extend from the trailing edge along a pressure side of the airfoil. Such pressure side biased cooling discharge openings provide the increased area necessary for the thin trailing edge to receive sufficient cooling air.

Embodiments of the present invention include a assembly for a gas turbine engine the assembly including a first platform and an airfoil extending from the first platform. The airfoil includes a suction side wall a pressure side wall a first fillet pressure side biased discharge openings and a first center cooling discharge opening. The suction side wall connects a leading edge and a trailing edge. The pressure side wall is spaced apart from the suction side wall and also connects the leading edge and the trailing edge. The pressure side wall and the first platform form an acute angle at the trailing edge. The first fillet is formed around a perimeter of the airfoil where the airfoil extends from the first platform. The pressure side biased cooling discharge openings are along the trailing edge outside of the first fillet. Each pressure side biased cooling discharge opening extends from the trailing edge along the pressure side wall. The first center cooling discharge opening extends along the trailing edge into the first fillet. The first center cooling discharge opening is centrally located between the pressure side wall and the suction side wall.

As noted above pressure side biased cooling discharge openings at a trailing edge of a turbine airfoil provide sufficient cooling air to the trailing edge that would otherwise have to be much thicker to provide the necessary cooling opening cross sectional area. Stator vanes and rotor blades are typically cast as a single piece and pressure side biased cooling discharge openings are created in the casting process. Stator vanes and rotor blades also include a fillet created in the casting process the fillet formed around a perimeter of the airfoil where the airfoil extends from the platform. The additional material provided by the fillet increases the mechanical strength where the airfoil and the platform meet. The additional mechanical strength is particularly important for airfoils that are bowed. Bowed airfoils that form an acute angle between the airfoil and the platform have inherently higher stresses in the fillet region compared with non bowed airfoil. This due to the additional mechanical loading and pressure loading of the bowed airfoil. However for airfoils that are bowed providing pressure side biased cooling discharge openings in the fillet at the trailing edge has proven to be difficult and expensive.

The process of casting a stator vane or a rotor blade results in metal flash being produced around the pressure side biased cooling discharge openings. For those pressure side biased cooling discharge openings at the trailing edge outside of the fillet removing the metal flash is relatively straightforward because the openings are easily accessible and the surrounding surface geometry is not complex. In addition outside of the fillet the mechanical strength requirement is not as critical so there is greater margin regarding the amount of material removed during the process. In contrast for pressure side biased cooling discharge openings at the trailing edge that extend into the fillet removing the metal flash can be difficult and time consuming. As a result of the acute angle formed between the tangentially bowed airfoil surface and the platform surface there is limited access and visibility to adequately and consistently remove the metal flash around the pressure side biased cooling discharge openings extending into the fillet. Typically finishing of this region is done manually and is operator dependent which can result in large variations in the finished product leading to increased scrap due to geometry variations that do not meet design blueprint requirements. The primary purpose of the fillet is to provide mechanical strength. Non uniform material removal results may result in compromised and variable mechanical strength. The increased time associated with hand finishing and increased scrap due to labor intensive operations results in increased part cost.

The present invention overcomes these difficulties in stator vanes and rotor blades with bowed airfoils by eliminating pressure side biased cooling discharge openings at the trailing edge from the fillet and employing only center cooling discharge openings in the fillet. Center cooling discharge openings extend along the trailing edge and are centrally located between a pressure side wall and a suction side wall of the vane airfoil. Center cooling discharge openings created during the casting process do not have metal flash around the openings. Thus there is no need to remove material from the fillet and no difficult and expensive blending of the openings with the surrounding metal surface. In addition because center cooling discharge openings do not extend along the pressure side wall as do pressure side biased cooling discharge openings more metal remains in the fillet after casting to provide greater mechanical strength. The result is a robust fillet with minimal structural variations and lower mechanical stresses. Also center cooling discharge slots have greater internal heat transfer ability when compared to pressure side biased cooling discharge openings. Thus the invention provides the additional benefit of reducing the fillet temperature thereby extending the life of the stator vane or rotor blade.

As illustrated in fan is positioned along engine center line Cat one end of gas turbine engine . Compressor is adjacent fan along engine center line C followed by combustor . Turbine is located adjacent combustor opposite compressor . High pressure rotor and low pressure rotor are mounted for rotation about engine center line C. High pressure rotor connects a high pressure section of turbine to compressor . Low pressure rotor connects a low pressure section of turbine to fan . Rotor blades and stator vanes are arranged throughout turbine in alternating rows. Rotor blades connect to high pressure rotor and low pressure rotor . Engine casing surrounds turbine engine providing structural support for compressor combustor and turbine as well as containment for cooling air flows Fc.

In operation air flow F enters compressor through fan . Air flow F is compressed by the rotation of compressor driven by high pressure rotor . The compressed air from compressor is divided with a portion going to combustor and another portion cooling air flow Fc employed for cooling components exposed to high temperature combustion gases such as stator vanes as described below. Compressed air and fuel are mixed and ignited in combustor to produce high temperature high pressure combustion gases Fp. Combustion gases Fp exit combustor into turbine section . Stator vanes properly align the flow of combustion gases Fp for an efficient attack angle on subsequent rotor blades . The flow of combustion gases Fp past rotor blades drives rotation of both high pressure rotor and low pressure rotor . High pressure rotor drives a high pressure portion of compressor as noted above and low pressure rotor drives fan to produce thrust Fs from gas turbine engine . Although embodiments of the present invention are illustrated for a turbofan gas turbine engine for aviation use it is understood that the present invention applies to other aviation gas turbine engines and to industrial gas turbine engines as well.

For brevity the embodiments described below are with respect to stator vanes. However it is understood that embodiments of the present invention encompass rotor blades as well as stator vanes.

Considering and together in operation as the flow of combustion gases Fp passes through stator vane vane airfoil properly aligns the flow of combustion gases Fp. Because vane airfoil is bowed flow of combustion gases Fp is directed away from vane OD platform and vane ID platform to reduce formation of energy wasting vortices. Cooling air flow Fc from compressor flows into the space between suction side wall and pressure side wall cooling vane airfoil . Cooling air flow Fc is discharged from vane airfoil through pressure side biased cooling discharge openings center cooling discharge opening and center cooling discharge thus cooling trailing edge . By employing center cooling discharge openings and which do not extend along pressure side wall instead of pressure side biased cooling discharge openings in fillets and more metal remains in fillets and to provide lower mechanical stresses in stator vane . Also because center cooling discharge openings and have greater internal heat transfer ability when compared to pressure side biased cooling discharge openings this embodiment provides the additional benefit of reducing temperature of fillets and thereby extending the life of stator vane . Most importantly employing only center cooling discharge openings and in fillets and respectively eliminates the need to remove metal flash from the area of restricted access and visibility due to the bow of vane airfoil .

A method of producing embodiments of the present invention described above in reference to includes casting stator vane as a single piece and removing metal flashing from only a portion of a plurality of cooling discharge openings along trailing edge the portion including the plurality of pressure side biased cooling discharge openings . The remaining portion of cooling discharge openings along the trailing edge are all center cooling discharge openings center cooling discharge openings and which do not require removal of metal flashing around the openings after casting. There is no need to remove material from fillets and and no difficult and expensive blending of the openings with the surrounding metal surface.

Central cooling discharge openings and are centrally located between pressure side wall and suction side wall . Central cooling discharge opening extends along trailing edge and is completely within fillet . Central cooling discharge opening extends along trailing edge between pressure side biased cooling discharge opening nearest fillet and central cooling discharge opening .

Operation of the embodiment of is as described above for except that cooling air flow Fc is discharged from vane airfoil through center cooling discharge openings and in addition to pressure side biased cooling discharge openings . As with the previous embodiment by employing center cooling discharge openings and which do not extend along pressure side wall instead of pressure side biased cooling discharge openings in fillet more metal remains in fillet to provide lower mechanical stresses in stator vane . Also because center cooling discharge openings and have greater internal heat transfer ability when compared to pressure side biased cooling discharge openings this embodiment provides the additional benefit of reducing temperature of fillet thereby extending the life of stator vane . Most importantly because unlike pressure side biased cooling discharge openings center cooling discharge openings and do not require the removal of metal flash. This eliminates many difficulties in removing metal flash due to the limited physical access to such openings in fillet because the vane airfoil is bowed in such a way that pressure side wall forms acute angle A with vane OD platform restricting access of tools and visibility during the process of removing the metal flash.

The embodiments describe above are illustrated with center discharge openings that are rectangular and trapezoidal. However it is understood that the present invention encompasses embodiments having center discharge openings of other shapes including for example circular elliptical diamond and square.

Embodiments of the present invention eliminate pressure side biased cooling discharge openings from a fillet at a trailing edge of a bowed stator vane or rotor blade airfoil and employ center cooling discharge openings instead. Center cooling discharge openings created during the casting process do not have metal flash around the openings. Thus there is no need to remove material from the fillet and no difficult and expensive blending of the openings with the surrounding metal surface. In addition because center cooling discharge openings do not extend along the pressure wall as do pressure side biased cooling discharge openings more metal remains in the fillet after casting to provide greater mechanical strength. The result is a robust fillet with minimal structural variations and lower mechanical stresses. Also center cooling discharge slots have greater internal heat transfer ability when compared to pressure side biased cooling discharge openings. Thus the invention provides the additional benefit of reducing the fillet temperature thereby extending the life of the stator vane or the rotor blade.
