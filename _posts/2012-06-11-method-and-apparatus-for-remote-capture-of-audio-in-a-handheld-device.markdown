This patent application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 520 463 filed on Jun. 10 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention relates to the field of mobile audio video capture analysis processing and compiling of data including audio files and video files with a mobile device.

The problem with current technology is that current mobile devices have limited capabilities of capturing quality audio primarily because the quality of microphone and the microphones proximity to the subject.

Other systems are limited in several aspects specific to audio. Smart devices such as smart phones have increasing capabilities with several application including camera and video camera function. The current design of a smart phone in one embodiment the iPhone does not enable remote audio capture as the audio microphone input is located on the phone or the device.

Smart devices such as smart phones have increasing capabilities with several applications including camera and video camera functions.

The current design of smart phones such as the iPhone does not enable remote audio capture because the audio input is located on the smart phone.

Some embodiments of the invention solve a needed feature to capture and record audio input. In some embodiments audio input and video input are captured and recorded.

AlignSync is a tool within the method of the invention the AlignSync tool is also referred to herein as an application module or algorithm . The AlignSync application in one embodiment addresses latency issues between the audio and video data.

In another embodiment the above apparatus captures stores and transmits audio data to a separate device using wireless technology.

A method in which audio is captured on a device transmitted via wireless technology to a second device.

A method in which a device capable of collecting audio input wirelessly from a second device wherein there first device is also capable of video input wherein the method includes a software application that uses the AlignSync module on the audio and the video.

In one embodiment the AlignSync module is pre programmed to automate the synchronization of the audio with the video.

In one embodiment the device is a Bluetooth connected microphone enabling the remote wireless capture of audio to smart phones.

In some embodiments the device transmits audio signals to a Bluetooth enabled smart phone via Bluetooth .

In some embodiments the device may contain integrated or removable memory to which an audio file mp3 wav etc. can be recorded.

In some embodiments the device may charge via a battery in the base of the unit or via a direct current power adapter.

In some embodiments an algorithm known as AlignSync calculates and removes latency between the audio and video files for seamless playback.

In one embodiment the stem of the microphone attaches via 20 tripod socket to a stand permitting hands free on dash use.

In one embodiment the AlignSync application permits the user to scrub or position the audio timeline in relationship to the video timeline.

In one embodiment the AlignSync application automatically synchronizes the audio timeline to the video timeline.

It will be readily understood to those skilled in the art that various other changes in the details material and arrangements of the parts and method stages which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the inventive subject matter may be made without departing from the principles and scope of the inventive subject matter as expressed in the subjoined claims.
