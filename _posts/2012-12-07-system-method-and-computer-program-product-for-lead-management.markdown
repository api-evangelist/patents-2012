The present invention in its disclosed embodiments is related generally to customer relationship management CRM and more particularly to a system methods and computer program products for managing prospective customers or leads. 

According to the Harvard Business Review firms that contacted potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly seven times more likely to qualify the lead as those that contacted the customer an hour later and more than 60 times as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer. Despite these findings 63 percent of companies failed to respond in that golden hour. Twenty four percent waited more than a day and 23 percent didn t respond at all.

Various systems methods and computer program products for call tracking i.e. the counting and gathering of marketing data on incoming phone calls that have been generated by a website are known in the prior art. Such systems methods and computer program products have typically been designed for the purposes of search engine optimization SEO assessing a user s return on investment in a pay per click PPC environment lead generation direct marketing and others.

Notwithstanding these developments none of the voice based marketing automation applications according to the prior art has enabled companies to convert more leads into sales. Web analytics solutions according to the prior art have also not provided a way to track phone calls by how they got to a given website.

Accordingly it is generally an object of certain embodiments of the present invention to provide a system methods and computer program products for managing potential customers or leads. 

More specifically it is an object of those and other embodiments of the present invention to provide a system methods and computer program products to enable staff to be substantially instantly notified of a web inquiry by a lead and enable them to then substantially instantly connect with the lead on the phone.

The above and other objects are achieved by use of an application that with little or no programming required to implement is easy to use on any website. Special email addresses to be placed on a company s web forms are issued to the company. When the form is completed the lead is still emailed to the company but the advanced voice interaction process is also triggered so sales staff can immediately follow up on leads.

Moreover the application allows people who have websites to track phone calls by how they got to the website. Simple means such as JavaScript may be loaded onto the webpage that tracks how a visitor came to the website and then displays a phone number that is unique to that visitor. When a call comes in the application determines which visitor called in based on the number they dialed and other metrics. This allows the application to match the source of the visit to the phone call itself.

Further objects advantages and novel features of the embodiments of the present invention and the structure and operation thereof are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein 

Exemplary embodiments are discussed in detail below. While specific exemplary embodiments are discussed it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only.

In a similar manner the term processor may refer to any device or portion of a device that processes electronic data from registers and or memory to transform that electronic data into other electronic data that may be stored in registers and or memory. A computing platform may comprise one or more processors.

Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals and characters represent like or corresponding parts and steps throughout each of the many views there is shown in a simplified block diagram of a customer relationship management CRM system for managing prospective customers or leads according to one embodiment of the present invention.

System is adapted to be accessed by users using one or more clients and or one or more phones . Such clients in turn may suitably comprise one or more conventional personal computers workstations tablet computers and the like operating either as a fat client or a thin client. It may be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that other clients such as Web enabled hand held devices smart phones and Internet appliances fall within the true spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.

Clients of the above types may suitably access system by way of a network . By use of the term network it should be understood that the foregoing is not intended to limit the present invention to any particular wireline or wireless network such as local area networks LANs metropolitan area networks MANs wide area networks WANs a public switched telephone network PSTN or combinations thereof.

Network may simply comprise the Internet also known as the Web or World Wide Web but it may similarly comprise intranets extranets virtual private networks VPNs and the like. Because system is also adapted to be coupled to one or more phones network may also comprise a PSTN. As is known the PSTN is the network of the world s public circuit switched telephone networks in much the same way that the Internet is the network of the world s public IP based packet switched networks. Originally a network of fixed line analog telephone systems the PSTN is now almost entirely digital and now includes mobile as well as fixed telephones. It is sometimes referred to as the Plain Old Telephone Service POTS .

Phones may be conventional wireline phones wireless phones IP phones satellite phones and the like. In accordance with presently preferred embodiments of the invention system may also comprise a CRM application and a database .

As is known use of the phones by users may provide certain telecommunications features such as Automatic Number Identification ANI and Dialed Number Identification Service DNIS . ANI provides the phone call recipient with the caller s phone number. The technology and method used to provide this information is determined by the service provider and is often provided by sending DTMF i.e. digital tone multi frequency tones along with the call.

Also known as Automated Number Identification or Calling Line Identification CLI ANI may arrive over the D channel of an ISDN PRI circuit out of band signaling or before the first ring on a single line inband signaling . Caller ID is the local phone company version of ANI and is usually delivered inband.

In call center applications ANI displays the number of the caller to the phone representative in real time. Among other things the call center can use the information to process the call based upon prior history or can forward the call to a different department or organization.

DNIS is a service sold by telecommunications companies to corporate clients that lets them determine which telephone number was dialed by a customer. This is useful in determining how to answer an inbound call. The telecommunications company sends a DNIS number to the client phone system during the call setup. The DNIS number is typically 4 to 10 digits in length.

For example a company may have a different toll free number for each product line it sells. If a call center is handling calls for multiple product lines the switch that receives the call can examine the DNIS and then play the appropriate recorded greeting. Another example of multiple toll free numbers might be used for multi lingual identification. A dedicated toll free number might be set up for Spanish speaking customers.

With IVR i.e. interactive voice response systems DNIS may be used as routing information for dispatching purposes to determine which script or service should be played based on the number that was dialed to reach the IVR platform. For example 0906 123 4567 and 0906 123 4568 may well both connect to the same IVR system but one number may be required to provide a competition service and the other might be an information line. The DNIS is what distinguishes these lines from each other and hence the IVR will know which service to provide to the caller.

Referring now to a more detailed depiction of the components of CRM application will now described. CRM application may simply comprise a MyLeadResponder module as described in greater detail herein below with reference to .

It may further comprise a dynamic phone number module a SourceTrak sets module a graphical user interface module a logging engine module a logic engine module a callback engine module and a call distributor module .

The principle of dynamic phone number insertion allows a company to display a unique phone number on its website based on the referral source of the traffic. For example a company could display one phone number on the company s website when a visitor arrives at the company s website by clicking on a specific pay per click PPC advertisement. A different phone number could be displayed on the company s website when a visitor arrives by clicking a link on a partner s webpage.

These dynamic numbers can be routed to any number the company chooses allowing the company to track which advertisements and referral sources generate the most phone calls an important part of return on investment ROI that has historically been very difficult to assess. Dynamic phone number module accomplishes this process in the manner shown hereinafter with reference to .

In general each website is tied to a specific SourceTrak set. The SourceTrak sets module contains all configuration information about which phone number to display based on the source of the visit. It comprises a set of rules that match various types of source information to a phone number or group of phone numbers.

There are generally three types of sources domain keywords and AdGroup Campaign. A domain source generally comprises the domain of the referring web page. A keyword source generally comprises the literal search string which may be extrapolated from the URL of the referring web page. An AdGroup Campaign source generally comprises a tag that is appended by users onto the end of their destination URLs in their PPC platform.

Companies configure their SourceTrak sets module to look for specific sources and coordinate that source with one or more phone numbers in one of the following configurations defined source dynamic group session group and main number.

A defined source may comprise a single source e.g. domain query string AdGroup that displays a single phone number. However it should be noted that multiple sources can be mapped to a single phone number.

A dynamic group source may comprise a set of defined sources associated with a pool of phone numbers. The SourceTrak sets module rotates through the pool of numbers displaying a different number to each visitor.

When the system encounters a visitor that has source data but has not been matched by a defined source or dynamic group CRM application displays a phone number from this pool. A new phone number will display to every new visitor. In such circumstances this comprises a session group.

If no source can be found then a Main Number displays. The Main Number may be the company s direct line or another defined phone number. In such circumstances this comprises a main number source.

Details regarding the graphical user interface module logging engine module logic engine module callback engine module and call distributor module will be described hereinafter with reference to and .

As shown in the architecture of system may also comprise a pair of Internet access lines e.g. primary and shadow conventional T3 lines which are cross connected from the backbone of Internet to one or more and preferably a pair of redundant routers . Incoming traffic from the first of such routers may then be suitably directed through a firewall to the second of such routers . For the sake of redundancy two firewalls may be cross connected as shown in .

A plurality of web servers . . . may be conveniently load balanced by use of the foregoing configuration. That is the load of incoming traffic from the Internet through the routers and firewalls may be balanced among each of the web servers . . . such that 1 certain incoming traffic may be routed to a particular web server . . . where that particular web server . . . had been recently used by a given user whose information had been cached on that particular web server . . . and as a result it would be more efficient to continue to use that particular web server . . . or 2 no single one of the web servers . . . would become overburdened.

Each of the web servers . . . may further comprise a suitable operating system e.g. Solaris Windows HP UX AIX GNU Linux and web server software such as Oracle iPlanet Web Server which is available on such operating systems and supports JSP and Java Servlet technologies PHP NSAPI CGI and ColdFusion. Optionally a certificate server may be installed on each of the web servers . . . to facilitate core digital certificate issuance and management services as well as distribution of certificates and certificate revocation lists to clients and other servers. Other forms of certificate servers e.g. web certificate servers and wireless certificate servers may likewise be deployed on each of the web servers . . . .

System may further comprise a plurality of application servers . . . coupled to the web servers . . . . In one embodiment of the present invention there may be six such application servers. At the same time a load balance broker LBB may be loaded on each of the web servers . . . to facilitate balancing of the load of communications between each of the web servers . . . and each of the application servers . . . .

For example when a request within the CRM application is intended for one of the application servers . . . it can go to one of potentially many instances of the application which may reside on different machines. The task of ensuring that simultaneous requests are distributed evenly across multiple instances in order to ensure efficient processing falls to the LBB.

There are two versions of a load balancing algorithm that may be used by the LBB one for use without session affinity and one with. In the former case i.e. without session affinity when a request is received the entire list of instances is sequentially searched starting from the first instance in the list and ignoring any failed instances. The entire list of valid instances then is searched for the instance with the lowest usage count. If multiple instances have the same low value the first one found is used. The only time the search ends prematurely is if an instance with a usage count of zero 0 is found. This is because it is not possible to improve upon this usage count and thus this instance is used automatically. At this point in time the usage count of the instance that is used is incremented.

In the latter case i.e. with session affinity the usage count of an instance goes up by one every time it is used to process a request. However when the request is done the usage count goes back down by one. In high load situations where multiple requests are submitted with little time in between multiple instances of the application automatically handle these requests. However in situations where the requests are somewhat further apart the usage count of an instance might have time to go back down by the time the next request comes in allowing a very small number of application server instances to process all the requests. This works well in cases where there is no session affinity. However because of the characteristic of session affinity always ensuring the same instance of the application to a particular browser session it would not be prudent to have a small number of application server instances handling multiple requests simply because they are not in quick succession. Toward this end the LBB has an index pointer into the list of instances in case of session affinity.

When a request comes in and a session cookie is attached i.e. it is not a first time user it gets the very same instance which processed the request the last time. There is no load balancing to be performed here. If however the request is from a new session the load balancing algorithm is much the same as without session affinity with a slight modification. The search for the least used application server instance starts with the instance pointed to by the index pointer instead of at the top of the list. Once an instance is used the index pointer is incremented to point to the next instance in the list with wrap around capability to ensure that the same instance is not bombarded with multiple requests. If a request with a session cookie points to an instance which has failed or fails at this time after three 3 retries the request is treated as if it were a new request and a new session cookie is assigned after load balancing is performed.

There is one primary difference between using session affinity and not doing so as far as load balancing is concerned. Without session affinity load balancing occurs at each request. The load balancing process with session affinity however only occurs at the very first request since subsequent requests get routed automatically to the same instance every time. Therefore one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the circumstances under which the system of the present invention may require load balancing with or without session affinity.

Referring again to it can be seen that beneath the layer of web servers . . . and application servers . . . may be a storage area network SAN . SAN may comprise a cluster server that is connected to receive incoming Internet traffic through each of the application servers . . . and to transmit outgoing Internet traffic through the routers and firewall from the SAN by way of either a file server or a database server . System may further comprise a state server and a content management server .

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention SAN may also comprise a fiber channel switched network or fabric. It is known for example that such networks provide a high performance any to any interconnect for server to server or server to storage traffic. Fiber channel switched networks also combine the characteristics of traditional networks e.g. large address space scalability and I O channels e.g. high speed low latency hardware error detection on a single infrastructure. Additionally fiber channel switched networks facilitate multiple protocols for networking e.g. IP storage e.g. SCSI and messaging e.g. VIA over a single infrastructure. This infrastructure can therefore be easily used to create SAN in which peripheral devices such as disk storage and tape libraries can be attached to the network and shared among attached nodes.

In another embodiment file server and database server may be redundantly configured. That is in the event that either of the servers goes down during a session the other can assume control of that session with the assistance of the cluster server . As a result the database service may be composed of one or more logical network addresses e.g. IP RDBMS software an underlying file system a logical volume manager and a set of physical disks being managed by the volume manager. If this service typically called a service group needs to be migrated to another node for recovery purposes all of its resources must be migrated together to re create the service on another node. A single large node may host any number of service groups each providing a discrete service to networked clients who may or may not know that they physically reside on a single node.

Service groups can thus be managed to maintain service availability through an intelligent availability management tool. Given the ability to test a service group to ensure that it is providing the expected service to networked clients and an ability to automatically start and stop it such a service group can be made highly available. If multiple service groups are running on a single node then they must be monitored and managed independently. Independent management allows a service group to be automatically recovered or manually idled e.g. for administrative or maintenance reasons without necessarily impacting any of the other service groups running on a node.

Application servers through in concert with the web servers . . . file server database server and the clients provide a conventional three tiered architecture. As with similar such three tiered architectures application servers through handle most of the application processing such as business logic processing and database integrity processing. The clients only handle interface processing while the file server and database server only handle database processing. As seen in the hardware comprising system may be substantially completed with the addition of high availability storage cross connected to the file server and database server . One suitable such high availability storage comprises the fiber channel switches a pair of disk controllers and a pair of disk arrays . System may further comprise a tape library which includes a plurality of advanced intelligent tape drives e.g. AIT2 tape drives and a plurality storage positions for the AIT2 tapes.

In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the invention system will allow for the importation of data surrounding user accounts from the standard network security structure in place. Users of the system may be required to login in order to access the system. Preferably such login may consist of a User Name and Password. After three unsuccessful login attempts for example the system may lock out the user account attempting to login. An administrative level user may then be required to restore a locked out account. Moreover an active session may be timed out if no activity with the system is detected for a given amount of time e.g. 30 minutes . The system may log user activity and be capable of reporting other user statistics.

Preferably system should support the use of the XML markup language. It should also support an extensive array of file types including graphic e.g. JPEG GIF BMP etc. audio e.g. WAV MP3 etc. video e.g. QIC Real AVI MPEG etc. and Mixed Media e.g. SWF etc. .

Referring now to the MyLeadResponder module will now be described. depicts a user at a client which includes input output means such as a keyboard . A company s webpage including a webform appears in a conventional browser window . As is well known browser windows are tools used to view websites on the Internet. They act as a window to the World Wide Web. Common versions of a browser are Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox Google Chrome Safari and Opera.

As shown in greater detail in webform is a conventional webform which is a web page that allows user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Webforms resemble paper or database forms because Internet users such as user fill out the forms using text fields and . For example webforms such as webform may also be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product or can be used to retrieve data e.g. searching on a search engine .

In addition to functioning as input templates for new information webforms such as webform may also be used to query and display existing data in a similar manner to mail merge forms with the same advantages. The decoupling of message structure and underlying data allow both to vary independently. The use of webforms for this purpose avoids the problems associated with explicitly creating separate web pages for each record in a database.

Webforms typically are defined in formal programming languages such as HTML Perl PHP Java Javascript or .NET including ASP.NET . The implementations of these languages often automatically invoke user interface idioms such as grids and themes minimizing programming time costs and risks. Webform as shown is a very simple webform that is both easy to incorporate into a company s website and merely asks for the full name business email company and phone number of user . Other information in the form of checkboxes radio buttons or additional text fields may also be used. When user has completely filled out the webform the user need only select the Download Now button to submit the query. This is accomplished by way of a special email address e.g. 9876543210 myleadresponder.com which is sent to the system .

Referring now to there is shown a simplified flowchart of the method in which prospective customers or leads are managed according to one embodiment of the present invention. When a webform is submitted or an email is sent to the special email address the system is designed to immediately call and alert a specified sales team member. A Find Me application not shown can also be enabled to better route phone calls across the sales team and ensure that a live contact is reached. The Find Me call forwarding application may a forward phone calls based on an agent s office schedule b forward calls to different phones or a group of phones based on an agent s office schedule c forward incoming calls in sequence or simultaneously d ring several phones at once in a specific order or in a random order e screen calls before the agent says hello and f screen calls by automatically asking for and recording the caller s name then listening to the announcement before choosing to accept the call.

System may also be used to keep a record of every conversation by recording phone calls. Even more call forwarding features may comprise customized music on hold transfer missed calls to email accessible voice mail or route unanswered calls to any other service within the application including other available agents.

Once connected to the agent the MyLeadResponder module relays the information from the webform by reading it to the agent using enhanced voicemail or the like. The agent may then say Yes into the phone to instantly connect with the prospect. In this way the sales team member can be talking with a prospect moments after that person has expressed interest in the company s products or services.

CRM application may comprise a plurality of special email addresses to be placed on the company s webforms . Each of the special email addresses so placed may correspond to different product lines specific agents or groups of agents e.g. different regions or any other categories the company prefers. When a particular webform is completed the lead is still emailed to the company but the advanced voice interaction process is also triggered so sales staff can immediately follow up on leads. The special email addresses may be in the form of as an email address an SMS address or a social media address such as a Facebook address a LinkedIn address a Twitter address or the like.

Method begins at step and progresses to a present webform step in which webform is displayed to user on the client . A determination is made at step whether user has submitted the completely filled out webform by selecting the Download Now button to submit the query. If user has submitted the webform it will be automatically forwarded at step to the company or one or more of the company s agents not shown by way of their regular email for response. At the same time system will retrieve the phone number s of the one or more agents in order to call an available agent at step . Such numbers may be retrieved from database .

If it is determined at step that user has not submitted the webform if e.g. user goes on to another web page within the company s website a determination may be made at step whether to present another webform to the user . If yes another webform may be presented to the user and the process repeated. If no information regarding the user e.g. data tracking the user s source such as the HTTP referrer and the base URI of the landing page as described herein below may be gathered and logged into the database at step .

Once the system has called the available agent a determination is made at step whether the agent has answered. If so system will read the subject line of the email to the answering agent at step using enhanced voicemail or the like. If the designated agent s has not answered as determined by step system may determine whether another agent should be called at step . Such other agents could for example be another agent within the same sales team the sales team s supervisor or a completely different sales team. If the determination is yes such other agent may be called at step and the process repeated. If no information regarding the agent s called may be logged into the database at step .

Once the subject line has been read to the agent by system a determination is made at step whether to call the lead. This may be accomplished by using known methods such as enhanced voicemail visual voicemail voicemail to email voicemail to SMS and the like. The caller s number may be highlighted on the agent s smart phone so that the agent can click it to substantially immediately call back.

Various methods to configure system according to embodiments of the present invention will now be described. In general configuration of the application is accomplished in the manner shown in . A method of configuring application may begin by configuring at step the possible sources of callers in the manner described herein above with regards to SourceTrak sets module . It ends by setting appropriate thresholds at step .

Configuration step comprises four more specific steps as shown in . It begins by configuring defined sources at step . It continues by configuring one or more dynamic groups at step and configuring a session group at step . It ends by configuring a main number at step .

When a call comes into system application attempts to match the call with a specific visitor. Application comprises three thresholds associated with each SourceTrak set that help define how that match may be made. The general step of setting these thresholds is shown in .

A lower threshold may be set at step . This lower threshold is the minimum amount of time a phone number should be associated with a visitor. If a particular phone number must be displayed by the system more than once during this lower threshold it means application cannot be as confident that it matched the proper source.

An upper threshold may be set at step . This upper threshold may be determined by how far back in time before a call is made should application look to find a visitor that was displayed that phone number. If there is no display of the phone number dialed within this upper threshold application will not match the call with a visitor.

A duplicate call threshold may be set at step . This duplicate call threshold may be determined by how far back in time before a call is made should application look to check and see if that caller called the same number.

Calls that route through the call distributor module will get associated with a visitor before the call is routed to an agent. All other calls with be associated with an agent immediately upon the completion of the call.

In further configuring system a user need only login to the application with for example the user s user ID and password. On a dynamic phone numbers page as shown in the user may select the Add new Match Term button to associate a specific phone number with a referral source. Different numbers may be assigned to individual match terms that can be added via the Add new Match Term button. These terms can be configured as one of three types as determined by a Match Type drop down menu not shown which may provide the following options 

Ad Campaign This is the most widely used match type for dynamic numbers. The campaign type applies to dynamic number insertion for any link as well as Google AdWords advertisements and pay per click advertisements.

Domain This will associate a dynamic phone number with a referring domain for example www.twitter.com.

A Notes field may be used as a description to keep track of the user s dynamic numbers. An Extension field may be used to display any text that the user would like to next to a particular dynamic number.

The Rank or order of the user s match terms is important. If a referral source satisfies two of the user s match terms the dynamic number with the higher rank will be displayed. Any given match term may be dragged up or down to change its Rank by using its respective vertical spinner .

Wildcards e.g. an asterisk on both sides of a domain match term may be used. Without the use of wildcards in the Match Term field only the exact match term result will lead to dynamic number insertion. For example if the type is domain and the match term is twitter.com the only result that will be associated with the phone number is twitter.com . Other similar terms such as www.twitter.com and http www.twitter.com ifbyphone will not be associated with this number. Using wildcards on both sides of a domain match term for example witter.com would insert the associated dynamic phone number for any referral source that contains twitter.com .

Referring now to the process of associating a campaign type dynamic number with any link or a PPC campaign will now be explained. To insert a dynamic number for a PPC advertisement on a Web page the user may insert a parameter into the Destination URL . The URL may be entered followed by ibp camp insert Ifbyphone match term without brackets . For example to display the 866 596 9037 phone number shown in on a Web page accessed via the Google AdWords Toll Free campaign shown in a user may insert mydomain.com ibpcamp tfn into the destination URL of the ad. It may be noted at this juncture that the match term tfn is the match term associated with the dynamic phone number in .

The same protocol applies to using dynamic number insertion for a campaign match type with any link. To insert the 866 596 9037 phone number a user s Website the user s HTML code for the referring link would look similar to the following 

Two segments of code which are displayed below may be added to the Web page s on which dynamic numbers will be displayed. A first code segment as shown below may be inserted into the head section of each of the Web page s so desired.

A second code segment as shown below may be placed at the position within the Web page where the desired number will be inserted.

As is generally known there are basically two ways to insert lines of code into the head section of a user s Web pages 1 by modifying the HTML source code directly which is a slightly more advanced technique and 2 by using a web page designer tool such as PageBuilder.

Inserting lines of code into the head section simply means that the lines of code must be inserted between the tags. For example if a user wanted to insert the first code segment into the head section of the simple web page shown above its HTML source code would appear as 

Web page designer tools e.g. PageBuilder also allow a user to insert code into the head section of the user s Web page without having to look at the HTML source code at all. The particulars of how to use such Web page designer tools to accomplish this are well within the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art and thus need not be described in detail herein.

If a user wanted to insert the second code segment into a similar such simple web page as shown above its HTML source code might appear as 

Dynamic number insertion may work using cookies. When a viewer comes to a user s website on which a dynamic number is displayed a cookie may be stored in the user s browser for 24 hours. This ensures that if a customer finds the user s website via one of the user s defined match terms but does not call immediately and then returns to the user s website some time later the initial referral source may be tracked as generating the call.

It is important to note at this juncture that a user configuring system may clear the user s browser cookies in between testing attempts. Without clearing such cookies the user will continue to see the same dynamic number for 24 hours.

Referring again to details of the process used in the logging engine will now be described. Visitors to a website may be tracked by installing the two code segments described herein above on a web page. The first code segment tracks the source of the visitor e.g. the HTTP referrer and the base URI of the landing page at step .

The HTTP referrer which occurs as an HTTP header field identifies from the point of view of an Internet web page or resource the address of the web page. This is commonly done so by the Uniform Resource Locator URL the more generic Uniform Resource Identifier URI or the internationalization and localization i18n updated Internationalized Resource Identifier IRI of the resource which links to it. By checking the HTTP referrer the new web page can see where the request originated.

Referrer logging is used to allow websites and web servers to identify where people are visiting them from for promotional or security purposes. It is also a popular tool to combat cross site request forgery but such security mechanisms are weakened by the ease of disabling or forging an HTTP referrer. The HTTP referrer is widely used for statistical purposes as done so at step within logging engine .

A URI is a string of characters used to identify a name or a resource on the Internet. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network typically the World Wide Web using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI.

One can classify URIs as locators URLs or as names URNs or as both. A Uniform Resource Name URN functions like a person s name while a Uniform Resource Locator URL resembles that person s street address. In other words the URN defines an item s identity while the URL provides a method for finding it.

A URI reference may take the form of a full URI the scheme specific portion of one or even some trailing component thereof including even the empty string. An optional fragment identifier preceded by may be present at the end of a URI reference. The part of the reference before the indirectly identifies a resource and the fragment identifier identifies some portion of that resource.

To derive a URI from a URI reference software converts the URI reference to absolute form by merging it with an absolute or base URI according to a fixed algorithm. The system treats the URI reference as relative to the base URI although in the case of an absolute reference the base has no relevance. The base URI typically identifies the document containing the URI reference although this can be overridden by declarations made within the document or as part of an external data transmission protocol. If the base URI includes a fragment identifier it is ignored during the merging process. If a fragment identifier is present in the URI reference it is preserved during the merging process. Web document markup languages frequently use URI references to point to other resources such as external documents or specific portions of the same logical document.

The second code segment displays a phone number at step . When a phone number is displayed the logging engine logs the source information as well as other information about the visitor e.g. IP address time of display etc. at step . Such information may be stored in database .

In order to match the source of a web site visit to the phone call itself logic engine performs the following steps. If the phone number is not in a SourceTrak set it will not be matched to a visitor. If the phone number is in a SourceTrak set but not in a dynamic group or session group the number will not be matched to a visitor. If a phone number is in a dynamic group or session group in any SourceTrak set it will attempt to be matched based on the thresholds configured in that set.

Logic engine will first check to see if the caller ID and number dialed for the current call match a previous call within the time period defined by the duplicate call threshold. If there is a match logic engine matches the call to the original visitor with the same rank as the original call. It will always attempt to match the caller to the most recent display assuming there was a display of that phone number within the timeframe determined by the upper threshold.

In matching the call to a visitor logic engine assigns it a rank over a predetermined range. For example a range of from 1 to 8 may be used where 1 represents the highest confidence that logic engine has matched the caller to the correct visitor and 8 represents the least. The algorithm used to determine such ranks within logic engine may be as follows.

A rank of 1 may be assigned by logic engine where there is a single display of the phone number dialed within the lower threshold and only one call to that number within that same threshold. A rank of 2 may be assigned by logic engine where there is a single display of the phone number dialed within the upper threshold and there is only one call to that number within that same threshold. A rank of 3 may be assigned by logic engine where there is a single display of the phone number dialed within the lower threshold but there are more than one calls to that number within that same threshold. A rank of 4 may be assigned by logic engine where there is a single display of the phone number dialed within the upper threshold but more than one call to that number within that same threshold.

A rank of 5 may be assigned by logic engine where there is more than one display of the phone number dialed within the lower threshold but only one call to that number within that same threshold. A rank of 6 may be assigned by logic engine where there is more than one display of the phone number dialed within the upper threshold but only one call to that number within that same threshold. A rank of 7 may be assigned by logic engine where there are more than one display of the phone number dialed within the lower threshold and more than one call to that number within that same threshold. Finally a rank of 8 may be assigned by logic engine where there are more than one display of the phone number dialed within the upper threshold and more than one call to that number within that same threshold.

With reference now to one may appreciate the variety of reports and features users of system may access. For example depicts a portion of a dashboard showing a pie graph which illustrates the sources of calls and a bar graph which illustrates the number of visits and calls attributed to such sources.

A plurality of parameters of the calls may be displayed including the source match term visits calls unique calls average duration and conversion rate. For example the AdGroup called ivrsn is shown with a Google conversion rate of 4.0 . Also shown are successful keywords with phone call conversions and unsuccessful keywords without phone call conversions. The telephone survey call for example is indicative of a low quality call while the advanced IVR based on location call is indicative of a high quality call.

This type of report shows call metrics e.g. number of calls average duration unique calls etc. associated with aggregated visitor information. This allows users to see what percentage of visitors called in broken out on multiple levels e.g. organic vs. PPC vs. direct by AdGroup by Keyword etc. . The information shows customers the return on investment they are getting from their PPC campaigns.

Another type of report is the Call Detail Report. This report may show details such as date and time of each call its caller ID call duration session ID domain keyword and AdGroup. An example of such a report is shown in .

Users of the system may also get notifications on their agent panel as shown in . This may be done by use of call back engine and with or without call distributor module . Agent panel provides information about incoming callers and allows agents to manually adjust their Agent Mode submit information about calls using Call Note Forms and transfer callers to different phone numbers or applications using Application Transfers.

As shown in agents may login to agent panel in the following manner 1 access system by going to its website and clicking a Login link 2 on the Login page click the Agent Login button in the bottom right and 3 on the Agent Login page enter the appropriate Agent ID and PIN and click the Login button .

Agent Modes determine how callers are handled when entering the call distributor module and provide information about how agents spend their time. To select a mode the user may hover the user s mouse over the current mode at the top of agent panel and select the desired mode from the drop down list as shown in .

The following describes the various Agent Modes and how they work. The Open mode indicates that an agent is available and ready to receive calls. If any agents are in the Open mode callers will bypass the queue and immediately begin transferring to an available agent. As opposed to the Open mode Active modes are modes which indicate that an agent is actively logged into the call distributor module but not currently available to take a call. If no agents are Open but at least one agent is in an Active mode callers will be placed in a queue to wait for an agent to become available.

Active modes comprise Calling On Call and Busy Work Calling mode indicates that a call is currently being transferred to the agent. If the call is accepted the agent s status is automatically set to On Call. If the call goes unanswered the agent s status is automatically set back to Open. On Call mode indicates that the agent is currently on the phone on a call accepted through the call distributor module or on an outbound call made via the agent panel . When the current call ends the agent s status may be automatically set back to Open to receive calls. Busy Work mode indicates that the agent is actively logged into the system but currently unavailable to take a call. This mode is often used when an agent is engaged in a phone call outside of the call distributor module . The Calling and On Call modes cannot be manually selected by an agent or manager. An agent is automatically set to these modes under the appropriate circumstances.

Inactive Modes comprise Closed Lunch Break and Busy Away . These modes indicate that an agent is unavailable to receive calls in the near future. If all agents are in Inactive modes the caller will be automatically routed to the No answer action application not shown . Closed mode indicates that the agent has signed out for the day and will not receive further calls. Lunch mode indicates that the agent is unavailable on lunch break. Break mode indicates that the agent is unavailable on personal break. Busy Away mode indicates that the agent is unavailable but has not signed out for the day.

To log an outbound call through system an agent may call using an outbound call portion of the agent panel . The agent can enter the phone number into the number fields using their keyboard the numbers on the keypad of their agent panel or by clicking the phone icon next to the incoming phone number in the Notification Messages area . Once the number is entered click the Click to Call button to initiate the call.

After clicking the Click to Call button the agent s phone will ring. Upon answering the agent will hear a prompt stating connecting your call and will then be connected to the number entered into the agent panel .

As is also shown in notification messages may be provided to the agent through agent panel . This section of the Agent Panel provides information about inbound calls offered to the agent including the time of the call the caller s phone number and any additional Agent Screen Pop information configured by managers on the Call Distributor Agent Configuration page.

If agents are using Call Note Forms to submit notes about calls forms can be selected by clicking the paper and pencil icon to the right of the caller s phone number.

Messages sent to agents by managers via the Manager Panel are also displayed in the Notification Messages section.

Application Transfers enable agents to transfer callers to another phone number or application via the Call Distributor Agent Panel. Application Transfers are configured by managers on the Call Distributor Agent Configuration page. Agents must be on an active call through the Call Distributor to perform an Application Transfer.

While on an active call through the distributor an agent can enter a phone number into the dial pad and click the Transfer button to re direct the caller to that number. Agents can initiate a pre configured Application Transfer by following these steps 1 Select the desired Application Transfer from the Redirect To dropdown menu and 2 Click the Redirect button. After redirecting a caller the agent s status will be automatically set back to Open to receive calls.

As noted above agent panel is a web page that agents log into. Whenever a call is routed to them the application displays information about the caller to that agent. For example if a visitor is searching for cheap red staplers the agent will see that pop up on her screen before picking up the phone.

Call distributor module may further comprise the ability to integrate information from the application and use it within a separate CRM system. To this end a Post Call Action feature will hit a web page with information about every call. This may include all relevant information about the visitor.

Call distributor module may further comprise a Conversion feature. When they do this their agents can mark a call as sold or not sold the amount of the sale and general notes on the call. Such fields in addition to the SourceTrak information are available from a Call Detail Report in the manner of the dashboards shown in . This allows customers to track close rates and revenue by source.

According to yet another embodiment of the system according to the present invention the Post Call Action feature may also be used. The goal of Post Call Action is to give users real time data collection abilities for calls as they complete with a myriad of call detail information at their fingertips. Functionally the post call action interface assists the user to generate a fully qualified web URL which is then filled in with the dynamic information corresponding to the call that the user wants and launching a REST API call to a specified web server. This will deliver the desired data in near real time as each call completes. The data reported by a Post Call Action can be simple or complicated a powerful capability leveraging the same everyday technology used to surf the web.

Calls can have multiple Post Call Actions further empowering any and all interested parties with only the information they need.

Post Call Action gives a user the ability to specify dynamic parameters in the URL that act as placeholders for call specific data. These so called placeholders are chosen in the Post Call Action configuration interface from a dynamically generated list based on the value of the Post Call Action Option drop down list. It can be as easy as adding a new dynamic parameter inputting an identifier for it in the newly available text box and choosing one of the dynamic placeholder values from the corresponding drop down list. When a Post Call Action is executed these placeholder values are first substituted with the corresponding pieces of call specific information before the process is completed. The system fills in the blanks. As many or as few of the available placeholders can be used in any order.

The Post Call Action configuration may be accessed by clicking Developer Tools and then Post Call Actions. As mentioned above a user can have multiple Post Call Actions. To create one click the Create a new Post Call Action link towards the bottom left.

Give the Post Call Action a name and leave the Active box checked. A user can disable it at anytime without having to delete it by un checking the Active box and saving.

The Post Call Action Option should be left on Call Detail Information for now. A Google Analytics option not shown may be used to send call information to the user s Google Analytics account as explained in greater detail herein below.

The Domain is the domain portion of the URL for the user s server. In the example shown in it is http kugler.no ip.info .

The Page field is the name of the file on the user s server that will be processing the information submitted from the NetGet. This is the page that will be sending back a response depending on the NetGet Action selected above. The Page field can contain sub folders if the user s file does not exist at the root level of the user s web server. For example if the user s page resides at http www.kugler.no ip.info ibp test pca log.php the user would enter ibp test pca log.php in the Page field .

Static Parameters do not depend on any actions taken by the SurVo. They are useful when a user has some data or token the user would like to send along.

For example if the user will interact with six separate SurVo Smart Forms and the user wants a plain English token to let the user know which one the user just used include a static parameter such as user josh and that static parameter will be sent along with the other data the user requests. If the user would like to send more than one static parameter the symbol may be used in between each pair e.g. name value name value name value .

The actual data about the phone call that gets sent to the user s server are contained in the dynamic parameters . A user can specify what information the user wants to receive and how it will be labeled.

To add a dynamic parameter a user may click the green plus button . Select one of the parameters from the drop down menu and then enter a name for this parameter. The name will be the key for this parameter and what the user will use to access it when the data is transmitted to the user s web server.

Below the parameters a hyperlink not shown may be displayed of what the URL that gets submitted to the user s server may look like. The user can click the link to test the Post Call Action.

When a call completes the actual date time of when the call started and the caller ID will be sent to the URL the user specifies. The following examples of dynamic parameters are explained below.

The Post Call Action tool lifts its functionality directly from the Net Integration feature found within SurVo but expands upon it for a powerfully diverse and dynamic enhancement to each and every call regardless of their nature and composition. The goal of Post Call Action is to give customers real time data collection abilities for calls as they complete with a myriad of call detail information at their fingertips. The first version of this tool provides access to all pertinent information found in the Call Detail Report 2.0. Functionally the Post Call Action interface assists the customer to generate a fully qualified web URL which is then filled in with the dynamic information corresponding to the call that the customer wants and launching a REST API call to a specified web server. This will deliver the desired data in near real time as each call completes. The data reported by a Post Call Action can be simple or complicated with virtually limitless possibilities a powerful capability leveraging the same everyday technology used the world over to surf the web.

As noted above calls can have multiple Post Call Actions further empowering any and all interested parties with only the information they need. Post Call Action gives the user the ability to specify dynamic parameters in the URL that act as placeholders for call specific data. These so called placeholders are chosen in the Post Call Action configuration interface from a dynamically generated list based on the value of the Post Call Action Option drop down list. It s as easy as adding a new dynamic parameter inputting an identifier for it in the newly available text box and choosing one of the dynamic placeholder values from the corresponding drop down list. When a Post Call Action is executed these placeholder values are first substituted with the corresponding pieces of call specific information before the process is completed. As many or as few of the available placeholders can be used in any order.

To further assist in maximizing the benefit of a Post Call Action the system provides a simple tool to debug web applications that accept the data sent by a Post Call Action through a testing interface. It s as simple as filling in mock data corresponding to the parameters the external web application expects and initiating the test.

Depending on the nature of the web application output may be displayed as the test concludes to ensure that everything flows as it should between the system and the defined off site location. The following options can be found in the interface 

Post Call Action Name Specifies an interface identifier for the Post Call Action for future editing testing and removal purposes.

Post Call Action Option Specifies the set of dynamic parameter placeholder values that are available for selection in the dynamic parameter section.

Submit Type Specifies whether the Post Call Action is executed as an HTTP GET or POST request to the target web server.

Domain Specifies the mandatory HTTP scheme http or https optional username password combination mandatory domain name and optional port compliant with RFC 3986 standards.

Static Parameters Specifies any number of equal separated key value pairs of URL variables with unchanging variables that should be a part of the Post Call Action URL each completed pair separated by ampersands optional and completely dependent upon the nature and use of the Post Call Action.

Dynamic Parameters Specifies any number of dynamically configured placeholder values for dynamic call data based on the value chosen from Post Call Action Option .

Completed URL Visually represents the completed Post Call Action URL with dynamic placeholders visible. The URL can be clicked to initiate a live test to ensure that it interoperates with the target web server as expected.

Reload Post Call Action If editing a pre existing Post Call Action this button will refresh the data on the page to reflect the saved values undoing any changes made since loading the page.

As an alternative to the embodiments shown in application may be utilized in the form of software or infrastructure as a service in the cloud computing environment. As is known the term cloud computing refers to a computing paradigm in which tasks are assigned to a combination of connections software and services accessed over a network. This network of servers and connections is collectively known as the cloud. Computing at the scale of the cloud allows users to access supercomputer level power. Using a thin client or other access point e.g. an iPhone BlackBerry or laptop users can reach into the cloud for resources as they need them. For this reason cloud computing has also been described as on demand computing. 

This vast processing power is made possible though distributed large scale cluster computing often in concert with server virtualization software e.g. Xen and parallel processing. Cloud computing can be contrasted with the traditional desktop computing model where the resources of a single desktop computer are used to complete tasks and an expansion of the client server model.

Calls using the system may be tracked to a sale. The call distributor module captures the sale and callback engine . In such instances the sold account may be matched to its last phone number and a call me back or SMS me back feature may be implemented. When application does not include the call distributor module such features will be shown in the agent panel . When application includes call distributor module the dollar sign may be clicked by the agent to indicate such sales.

Cloud computing is often used to sort through enormous amounts of data such as large call centers. In fact Google has an initial edge in cloud computing precisely because of its need to produce instant accurate results for millions of incoming search inquires every day parsing through the terabytes of Internet data cached on its servers. Google s approach has been to design and manufacture hundreds of thousands of its own servers from commodity components connecting relatively inexpensive processors in parallel to create an immensely powerful scalable system. Google Apps Maps and Gmail are all based in the cloud. Integration of the application described herein would be easily integrated with services such as Google Analytics in the cloud.

In alternative embodiments hardwired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement features consistent with principles of the invention. Thus implementations consistent with principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

Exemplary embodiments may be embodied in many different ways as a software component. For example it may be a stand alone software package a combination of software packages or it may be a software package incorporated as a tool in a larger software product. It may be downloadable from a network for example a website as a stand alone product or as an add in package for installation in an existing software application. It may also be available as a client server software application or as a Web enabled software application. It may also be embodied as a software package installed on a hardware device.

As noted above application could likewise be used with phones using VoIP. Local number portability LNP and mobile number portability MNP also impact VoIP business. In November 2007 the Federal Communications Commission in the United States released an order extending number portability obligations to interconnected VoIP providers and carriers that support VoIP providers. Number portability is a service that allows a subscriber to select a new telephone carrier without requiring a new number to be issued. Typically it is the responsibility of the former carrier to map the old number to the undisclosed number assigned by the new carrier. This is achieved by maintaining a database of numbers. A dialed number is initially received by the original carrier and quickly rerouted to the new carrier. Multiple porting references must be maintained even if the subscriber returns to the original carrier. The FCC mandates carrier compliance with these consumer protection stipulations.

A voice call originating in the VoIP environment also faces challenges to reach its destination if the number is routed to a mobile phone number on a traditional mobile carrier. VoIP has been identified in the past as a Least Cost Routing LCR system which is based on checking the destination of each telephone call as it is made and then sending the call via the network that will cost the customer the least. This rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability. With GSM number portability now in place LCR providers can no longer rely on using the network root prefix to determine how to route a call. Instead they must now determine the actual network of every number before routing the call.

Therefore VoIP solutions also need to handle MNP when routing a voice call. In countries without a central database like the United Kingdom it might be necessary to query the GSM network about which home network a mobile phone number belongs to. As the popularity of VoIP increases in the enterprise markets because of least cost routing options it needs to provide a certain level of reliability when handling calls.

MNP checks are also important to assure that this quality of service is met. By handling MNP lookups before routing a call and by assuring that the voice call will actually work VoIP service providers are able to offer business subscribers the level of reliability they require.

Thus it may be necessary to adapt application to log and display data relating to phones which use VoIP. Such data may include identification of the home network home address foreign network care of address home agent foreign agent and binding.

As is known the home network a mobile device is the network within which the device receives its identifying IP address i.e. home address which is the IP address assigned to the device within its home network. In contrast a foreign network is the network in which a mobile node is operating when away from its home network. The care of address of a mobile device is the network native IP address of the device when operating in a foreign network. A home agent is a router on a mobile node s home network which tunnels datagrams for delivery to the mobile node when it is away from home. It maintains current location i.e. IP address information for the mobile node and may be used with one or more foreign agents. A foreign agent is a router that stores information about mobile nodes visiting its network. Foreign agents also advertise care of addresses which are used by Mobile IP. A binding is the association of the home address with a care of address. All of this information relating to VoIP based phones may be valuable to users of application particularly in an eCommerce mobile tracking environment.

The systems methods and computer program products for managing prospective customers or leads according to the present invention are easily used by themselves or in conjunction with systems methods and computer program products for tracking website customer calls e.g. SourceTrak as described herein above. For example an agent receiving the prompt from the MyLeadResponder module may not only substantially immediately call the user who submitted the webform but also store and mine data stored in the database relating to that user or the advertising medium e.g. billboard magazine newspaper website or the like from which the user was referred. By using a phone number that is unique to that visitor user or a special email address e.g. 9876543210 myleadresponder.com which incorporates such a unique phone number the lead s request may be substantially immediately answered. Moreover valuable data regarding that lead may be accessed updated and used by the agent answering the lead s request in order to maximize the potential to qualify the lead and close the sale.

For example webform may include a plurality of radio buttons or checkboxes each of which when selected by the user could indicate the particular advertising medium e.g. billboard magazine newspaper website or the like from which the user heard about the product or service and about which the user is asking when submitting the webform . The systems methods and computer program products for managing leads according to the present invention could designate different unique phone numbers and or different special email addresses to the different advertising media. For example 

While various exemplary embodiments have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation. Thus the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments but should instead be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.
