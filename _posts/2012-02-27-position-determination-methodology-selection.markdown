This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 447 544 filed May 26 2011 and entitled POSITION DETERMINATION METHODOLOGY SELECTION which is assigned to the assignee hereof and which is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject matter disclosed herein relates to electronic devices and more particularly to methods apparatuses and articles of manufacture for use in or by a mobile device to make selective use of one or more available on board positioning resources some of which may employ different position determination methodologies.

Mobile devices such as PDAs cell phones smart phones and or the like typically include functionality to provide location based services. For example mobile devices may host applications for performing navigation functions or other functions that use position estimates of the mobile device obtained in real time. In particular example implementations a mobile device may implement several different technologies for obtaining location estimates in real time. For example a mobile device may include one or more receivers capable of acquiring signals from terrestrial based or satellite based transmitters to obtain information for use in computing a location estimate or position fix. Such technologies may include for example obtaining position fixes from a satellite position system such as the Global Positioning System GPS or other global navigation satellite system GNSS measuring ranges to terrestrial based cellular base stations using advanced forward trilateration AFLT measuring the signal strength RSSI received from WLAN Access Points APs and or round trip time RTT between the mobile and APs just to name a few examples. In other implementations a mobile device may obtain a location estimate or position fix using multiple different technologies in a so called hybrid positioning system.

It should be understood that different positioning technologies as pointed out above have different capabilities and limitations etc. For example some technologies will enable a quicker time to fix than others. Similarly some technologies will provide a more precise location estimate than others. Also certain technologies may have different power consumption characteristics and therefore consume different amounts of stored battery life. Also depending on a particular operating environment certain technologies may not be available while others may be available.

In accordance with certain aspects a method may be provided for use in a mobile device to identify one or more attributes for each of a plurality of positioning resources available at the mobile device wherein each of the plurality of positioning resources provides a position fix of the mobile device based at least in part on at least one of one or more wireless signals received by the mobile device or one or more signal received from one or more sensors onboard the mobile device and wherein at least one of the plurality of positioning resources has at least one of the one or more attributes that is different than at least one other of the plurality of positioning resources obtain a request for a position fix of the mobile device and select at least one of the positioning resources for obtaining a position fix based at least in part on the request and the one or more attributes.

As pointed out above mobile devices typically have capabilities to obtain location estimates and or position fixes referred to herein after simply as a position fix or position fixes in support of one or more applications or functions which may be referred to interchangeably herein . Also as discussed above different technologies available for obtaining position fixes on a mobile device typically vary in their ability to provide accuracy in location estimates ability to obtain a position timely fashion e.g. time to fix propensity to consume power and availability. Here embodiments described herein are directed to among other things managing resources available for obtaining location estimates or position fixes in support of applications based at least in part on particular attributes of the different position determination technologies available for use.

Several techniques are described herein by way of example and which may be implemented using various methods apparatuses and or articles of manufacture for use in or by a mobile device to make selective use of one or more available on board positioning resources e.g. various subsystems provided within a mobile device some of which may employ different position determination methodologies.

By way of an initial example a mobile device may be enabled to identify one or more attributes for each of a plurality of positioning resources which may be available at the mobile device. Here for example the plurality of positioning resources may be used to assist in determining a position fix of the mobile device e.g. based at least in part on one or more wireless signals received by the mobile device one or more on board sensors e.g. inertial environmental etc. . Since some of the positioning resources may utilize different position determining methodologies e.g. some may work with different wireless signals certain sensors etc. it may be beneficial to select one or more specific positioning resources at a given time to assist in determining a position fix the mobile device. Accordingly one or more of the positioning resources may have one or more attributes that is different in some way.

By way of example one or more attributes may correspond to an operational state of the mobile device. For example attribute may correspond to a particular operational state of the mobile device by indicating whether or not a particular positioning resource may or may not provide an adequate position fix e.g. with a desired accuracy within a desired first time to fix with a particular desired format etc. as may be desired required by the particular operational state. For example a mobile device may have emergency operational state in which a position fix with a particular accuracy time to fix format and or the like or some combination thereof may be desired.

In certain example implementations one or more attributes may correspond to at least one position fix criteria. For example a position fix criteria may characterize at least in part an expected power consumption an expected achievable time to fix an expected achievable position accuracy an expected position availability an expected position format and or the like or some combination thereof with regard to a positioning resource.

In certain example implementations a position fix criteria may characterize one or more policies that may be considered in selecting a positioning resource. For example a position fix criteria may characterize a use policy a security policy a preference policy and or the like or some combination thereof with regard to the mobile device a requesting application or function a user of the mobile device a positioning resource a wireless signal transmitting device and or the like or some combination thereof.

A mobile device may for example obtain a request for a position fix of the mobile device. For example a request may be obtained from one or more applications and or functions enabled at least in part via the mobile device. In certain example implementations a request for a position fix may be indicative of one or more desired characteristics for the position fix. For example one or more desired characteristics for a position fix may correspond directly or indirectly to one or more attributes that have been identified for positioning resources available at the mobile device. In an example implementation a desired characteristic for position fix may be indicative of a desired position accuracy a desired time to fix a desired position format etc. In an example implementation desired characteristic for position fix may characterize a requesting application function in some manner with regard to a use policy a security policy a preference policy etc. Thus in certain example instances mobile device may select one or more positioning resources for obtaining position fix es based at least in part on a comparison of one or more desired characteristics to one or more attributes.

In accordance with certain example implementations having obtained at least one request for position fix mobile device may select at least one of the positioning resources for obtaining a position fix based at least in part on the request and the one or more attributes that have been identified for the various positioning resources available at the mobile device. In certain example instances a mobile device may consider whether a recently obtained position fix from one or more of the positioning resources satisfies a request for a position fix. For example a mobile device may consider whether recently obtained position fix may or may not satisfy a request for a position fix based at least in part on an age of the recent position fix accuracy of the recent position fix the format of the recent position fix and or the like or some combination thereof. In certain example instances a mobile device may further consider one or more signals associated with one or more sensors e.g. inertial sensors environmental sensors light sensor audio sensor that may indicate whether the mobile device has or has not been moved significantly since the recent position fix was obtained. In certain example instances a mobile device may consider one or more policies in determining whether a recent position fix may be used to satisfy a subsequently received request for a position fix. Thus for example in certain instances it may be improper with regard to a particular policy to provide a position fix having a particular level of accuracy to certain applications functions. If a mobile device determines that a recently obtained position fix satisfies a subsequently received request for a position fix then the mobile device may identify the recent position fix in response to a request.

By way of some example implementations a mobile device may comprise one or more of an SPS based positioning resource an AFLT and or other like based positioning resource a cell sector ID and or other like based positioning resource a wireless local area network wireless wide area network and or other like Wi Fi based positioning resource a near field and or other like wireless communication based positioning resource an ad hoc wireless network and or other like based positioning resource and or the like or some combination thereof. In certain other example implementations a mobile device may comprise one or more sensors such as one or more inertial sensors e.g. an accelerometer a gyroscope etc. one or more environmental sensors e.g. a magnetizer a compass a barometer a thermometer a light sensor a sound sensor etc. .

In accordance with certain example implementations a mobile device may select position fix from a plurality of position fixes obtained from one or more of the positioning resources. In accordance with certain example implementations a mobile device may combine or otherwise handle a plurality of requests for positioning fixes from one or more application functions in selecting a particular obtained position fix and or in selecting a particular positioning resource to obtain a position fix.

In accordance with certain example implementations a request may be obtained from and or a position fix may be provided to an application programming interface capable of serving a plurality of applications or functions that are at least in part implemented at the mobile device.

As illustrated by way of certain example implementations herein one or more processing units may be provided at a mobile device to provide a first manager capability e.g. hardware or firmware operating in accordance with certain programming instructions for obtaining a request for a position fix of the mobile device from an application or a function e.g. directly indirectly via an application programming interface . For example in certain instances a unified location manager ULM may be provided to act as a first manager capability to obtain a request for a position fix and or to provide a position fix and or information indicative of such a position fix to application function associated with a request for a position fix. Additionally in certain example implementations a second manager capability may be provided that may be responsive to a first manager capability at least in part in selecting at least one of the positioning resources for obtaining a position fix. For example in certain instances one or more location method managers LMMs may be provided to act as a second manager capability to select one or more positioning resources for obtaining a position fix in response to a request for position fix. Further in certain example implementations a third manager capability may be provided that may be responsive to a second manager capability at least in part providing at least one command to at least one of the selected positioning resources. For example in certain instances one or more subsystem managers SSMs may be provided to act as a third manager capability in initiating or otherwise commanding that a selected positioning resource be used to obtain or at least attempt to obtain a position fix. In certain example implementations one or more subsystem controllers SSCs may also be provided to operate with the LMMs and or SSMs. In accordance with certain further example implementations a first manager capability a second manager capability and or a third manager capability may be provided at least in part by a modem processor and or the like which may be responsive at least in part to at least one request received from an application processor and or the like.

It should be understood that computing platform and or other like mobile device may also or alternatively comprise one or more other circuits mechanisms etc. not shown that may be of use in performing one or more other functions or capabilities and or supportive of certain example techniques as provided herein.

Computing platform for example in the form of mobile device may be enabled e.g. via one or more wireless interfaces for use with various wireless communication networks such as a wireless wide area network WWAN a wireless local area network WLAN a wireless personal area network WPAN and so on. The term network and system may be used interchangeably herein.

Attention is drawn next to which is a schematic block diagram illustrating certain features of an example processing architecture for use in a mobile device comprising an application processor and modem processor wherein modem processor may selectively use one or more available on board positioning resources e.g. In response to a request from application processor in accordance with an example implementation.

Application processor may host a plurality of applications which use location estimates and or position fix information obtained using any one or more of several positioning resources as discussed herein. Such applications illustrated as APP through APP n may comprise for example one or more navigation applications one or more search functions one or more advertising applications just to provide a few examples. In a particular illustrated implementation application processor may communicate with modem processor through one or more connections e.g. a system bus etc. . Thus for example one or more applications may interact with and or communicate with entities hosted on modem processor through a location Application Programming Interface API and location manager which may be hosted on application processor and through a unified location platform ULP API .

Accordingly one or more applications may initiate one or more requests for a position fix from a unified location manager ULM . In other implementations applications may request of ULM to provide periodic position fixes. Such requests for a position fix from ULM may also indicate a desired level of accuracy and or timeliness e.g. as determined from time to fix just to provide a couple of examples of desired characteristics that may be indicated in or by such requests. Subject to the availability of positioning resources to satisfy a request e.g. by meeting such desired characteristics ULM may select and or allocate one or more specific technologies e.g. positioning resources to obtain a position fix satisfying a request.

According to an example implementation ULM may satisfy desired characteristics in a request by selecting one or more location method managers LMMs . LMMs may for example define particular distinct methodologies for obtaining measurements for use in computing position fixes. Such methodologies may include for example processing of SPS signals to multiple satellite transmitters for obtaining pseudorange measurements obtaining measurements of ranges to terrestrial base stations for use in AFLT processing signals transmitted by Wi Fi access points and or the like for obtaining information for use in computing a position fix obtaining a position fix by obtaining sector cell ID information e.g. from an acquired pilot signal transmitted from terrestrial base stations processing signals transmitted by other electronic devices in proximity to mobile device to obtain a position fix related information e.g. using location information from another device that may be in an ad hoc network with the mobile device using location information from another device that may be close enough to the mobile device for a near field or and or other like wireless signal reception exchange a hybrid position techniques using two or more of the aforementioned techniques just to name a few non limiting examples of position determination methodologies that may be used.

Here LMMs may be capable of commanding system resources e.g. processing resources wireless interfaces battery resources sensors etc. for obtaining information such as measurements for use in computing a position fix. Here an LMM may signal one or more subsystem controllers SSC to activate resources for use in obtaining information e.g. acquiring signals that may be used in obtaining position fixes. Similarly an LMM may signal to one or more location estimator controllers LEC . Here LECs may configure processing resources for obtaining computing position fixes based at least in part on information such as measurements obtained through actions of one or more LMMs as discussed above.

As illustrated in one or more subsystem message buses and or may be provided to support ULM SSCs and LECs . Here for example as shown subsystem message bus in modem processor may further couple to one or more location estimators LEs SSM and an aggregating location estimator ALE . Here SSM is illustrated as relating to one or more positioning resources using one or more of a cellular sector AFLT GNSS and or other like position determine methodology. Further for example as shown subsystem message bus in application processor may be coupled to subsystem message bus e.g. via connections and to an example SSM which in this instance relates to one or more positioning resources using Wi Fi signaling based position determine methodology. LE and a unified transport manager UTM are also shown as being coupled via connections to a generic IP transport of application processor which may provide further access to other positioning resources represented here by SUPL capability and XTRA capability that may use certain other position determine methodologies. Similarly UTM is shown as possibly providing further access to one or more servers which may also provide additional information that may be considered in determining a position fix. Additional assistance in obtaining and or providing information relating to a position fix may be provided to ULM through connections via a helper service within an application processor which may access further APIs e.g. such as a HLOS API other third party APIs etc.

Attention is drawn next to which is a schematic block diagram illustrating certain features of an example modem processor providing a plurality of management capabilities through which selective use of one or more available positioning resources may be implemented in accordance with an example implementation.

In a particular implementation LMM may maintain attributes associated with a particular positioning resource and or associated location determination methodologies. For example an LMM may store one or more records in memory indicating one or more attributes and or an operational state associated with a particular positioning resource and or associated location determination methodology. In some implementations the attributes and state of a particular positioning resource may be static. In other implementations one or more attributes associated with a positioning resource and or an operational state associated with a positioning resource and or mobile device and or some position determination methodology associated there with may be updated in response to changing conditions or events. In handling a request from an application to provide a position fix ULM may select one or more LMMs to obtain information such as measurements for use in performing this task. As discussed above requests from applications may be associated with one or more particular position fix criteria. Accordingly ULM may select from among available LMMs that meet or exceed the particular position fix criteria established or set forth in requests from applications . Here ULM may examine specific attributes or states maintained by the LMMs to determine which if any LMMs a be capable of providing a resource to obtain information e.g. such as measurements for use in computing position estimates that satisfy one or more of the desired characteristics for a position fix position fix indicated by a given request.

As shown in an LMM may direct one or more messages to one or more SSCs to request actions in connection with obtaining information through one or more positioning resources . In a particular non limiting example implementation an SSC may be dedicated to directing controlling a single SSM . As shown in a positioning resource may include related hardware software and or wireless interface circuitry for obtaining information for use in computing a position fix. In particular implementations a positioning resource may be capable of obtaining measurements and or information that may be used for computing a position fix for mobile device . For example a positioning resource may include a WiFi subsystem comprising circuitry and or processing for communicating with IEEE Std. 802.11 access points and or the like. A positioning resource may also comprise circuitry and or processing for receiving and processing signals received a cellular base station and or the like. For example a positioning resource may comprise an AFLT subsystem to obtain measurements to be processed for computing a range to a base station at a known location for performing a location estimate using AFLT. Alternatively a positioning resource may comprise a sector cell ID subsystem to acquire a pilot signal transmitted from a base station including being modulated with a cell ID which is representative of a base station at a known location. A positioning resource may also include a GNSS measurement engine ME subsystem comprising circuitry and or processing resources capable of acquiring signals transmitted from a satellite positioning system to obtain pseudorange measurements to space vehicle having transmitters thereon. As known to those of ordinary skill in the art such pseudorange measurements may be used for computing a location estimate or position fix. Information obtained from positioning resources for use in computing a position fix e.g. from acquiring signals transmitted from IEEE Std. 802.11 access points cellular base stations and or SPS transmitters may be routed through subsystem message bus to one or more LEs . LEs may compute the location estimate e.g. indicative of and or relating to a position fix using information obtained from one or more positioning resources . In certain example instances an LE may be capable of applying one or more algorithms and or heuristic algorithms for computing a location estimate and or position fix. In other implementations one or more positioning resources may also include or otherwise make use of one or more sensors such as for example an inertial sensor comprising one or more accelerometers gyroscopes and magnetometers just to name a few examples. It should be understood that specific subsystems to provide measurements and or information to be used in computing a position fix are merely examples provided for the purpose of illustration and that claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects.

In an example implementation an SSC may receive a selection from one or more LMMs to obtain information or measurements for use in performing a location service such as obtaining a position fix. Here in addition to activating or configuring a particular positioning resource through a corresponding SSM a particular SSC may also configure an appropriate LE e.g. through a corresponding LEC . Here for example an LE may be capable of applying any one of several algorithms heuristics computation techniques etc. for computing a solution based at least in part on measurements and or information obtained from one or more positioning resources .

As pointed out above modem processor may provide a plurality of positioning resources which may use various methodologies for obtaining a position fix using any one of several combinations of technologies or modes. In a particular implementation shown in an LMM may be capable of signaling to and or commanding a one or more SSCs and or LECs . In a particular implementation an LMM may decide which positioning resources and or LEs are to be enabled and or employed. In a particular implementation an LMM may have knowledge and or access to a description of how particular SSCs and LECs are to be employed. Here for example an LMM may be statically pre programmed and or otherwise affected in some manner with certain capabilities of SSCs and LECs to support certain particular position determination methodologies. Upon determining such particular modes to be employed and or enabled an LMM may provide configuration commands to one or more SSCs e.g. to command configure an associated positioning resource and or configuration commands to one or more LECs e.g. to command configure an LE .

In certain example implementations an LMM may monitor a status of associated LEs and positioning resources and report there from one or more attributes and states to ULM . In certain example implementations ULM may determine desired position fix characteristics for active location clients e.g. applications . Such desired characteristics may be based upon particular requests received from active client applications . In certain instances ULM may compare or otherwise apply certain desired characteristics of the outstanding current location client applications to one or more attributes and or states of positioning resources for determining which one or more LMMs may be employed for obtaining information and or measurements for use in computing a position fix that may satisfy one or more particular requests.

In certain example implementations an LMM may have a dedicated LE or share an LE with other LMMs . In a particular non limiting example implementation an LEC may be dedicated to directing controlling a single LE . Similarly an LMM may have a dedicated positioning resource or share a positioning resource with other LMMs . Likewise multiple LMMs may share the same positioning resource and may attempt to configure the shared positioning resource differently. In a particular implementation an LMM may have only one outstanding active command to any particular SSC or LEC at any one time and newly issued commands may overwrite an existing command. An LMM may be enabled or disabled by ULM . In a particular implementation one LMM may not enable or disable another LMM .

Table 1 below summarizes some example location determination methodologies that may be configured and or implemented by an LMM according to particular example implementations. Here Table 1 also shows how particular pairs of LECs and SSCs may be used and or configured to implement a particular associated location determination methodology of a particular LLM .

A particular SSC may be responsible for generating and sending appropriate commands to a particular SSM to control a particular operation of a particular positioning resource e.g. based upon commands received from an LMM and or one or more external events e.g. signal from a wake up timer . In a particular example implementation an SSM may support only one command at any time and a newly received command may overwrite an existing command. Since multiple LMMs may share the same positioning resource and configure the particular positioning resource differently an associated SSC may merge multiple configuration requests into a single command and send that command to the associated SSM to control the operation of the associated positioning resource . An SSC may also be responsible for implementing features specific to a particular positioning resource by sending appropriate commands to an associated SSM associated LEC and other functional entities.

Certain example implementations ULM may continuously and or at certain selected times evaluate LMM for attributes and states relating to one or more positioning resources to select an appropriate available position determination methodology to be used in meeting certain desired characteristics of outstanding request for a position fix. Based at least in part on a selected position determination methodology ULM may determine particular positioning resources to be enabled and may initiate commands to configure particular LMM s accordingly.

In certain example implementations ULM may send a message to each LLM requesting current available attributes and or states associated with one or more positioning resources. Upon receiving such a message an LMM may respond with a message to each SSC that is used by this particular LMM for a particular location determination methodology. In response to this request from the LMM an SSC may send another message to its associated SSM to request such attributes and or states. Once an SSM is identified attributes and or states of one or more positioning resources it may report such information to applicable SSC which may further report such information back to the requesting LMM .

Having received response messages from applicable SSCs as to particular attributes and states of available positioning resources an LMM may subsequently send a message to the ULM to report such current attributes and or states. Having received messages from LMMs reporting attributes and or states ULM may evaluate available position determination methodologies as reported by LMMs in terms of attributes and or states e.g. which may define certain available position fix criteria with certain desired characteristics associated with a request for position fix. ULM may send a message to a selected LMM to initiate a particular associated position determination methodology e.g. via one or more positioning resources . Responsive to receiving such a message from ULM to initiate the particular location determination methodology an associated LMM may decide which positioning resources and LEs are to be enabled and configured. LMM may for example provide messages to one or more SSCs and one or more LECs to enable and or configure the appropriate positioning resources and or LEs . On receiving a configuration message from an SSC an SSM may configure and activate its associated positioning resource . Similarly responsive to receiving a message from an LEC an LE may commence computing a position fix and or the like e.g. on a periodic basis.

In certain example implementations an ALE may select a particular position fix generated by one or more LEs which may be provided in a response from ULM to a respective requesting application . In an example implementation ULM may perform certain quality of service checks on new position fixes and provide these position fixes to one or more requesting applications according to their particular desired characteristics in light of the available attributes and or states e.g. as discussed above.

In certain example implementations ULM may evaluate certain attributes and or states for available positioning resources against certain desired characteristics for a request for position fix from an application and select an appropriate position determination methodology of a positioning resource to be used in determining a position fix. Accordingly in certain implementations a ULM may choose to continue using a current operating LMM or change to employing a different LMM . If ULM chooses to continue with operation of a current LMM ULM need not take any action. However if ULM chooses to use different LMMs ULM may send messages to turn on or turn off or activate or deactivate particular LMMs .

Attention is drawn next to which is a schematic block diagram illustrating certain features of an example processing scheme for a plurality of management capabilities through which selective use of one or more available positioning resources may be implemented in accordance with an example implementation.

Processing scheme further illustrates certain advantages is provided in the example implementations of . As illustrated at one or more applications may communicate one or more requests for a position fix to ULM . The one or more requests may be indicative of one or more desired characteristics that the application has for the position fix. ULM may compare the desired characteristics for a given request to attributes and or states as reported with regard to one or more available positioning resources . ULM may direct one or more LMMs in some manner to initiate obtaining a position fix for a given request. In response an LLM may direct one or more LECs to use one or more LEs in some manner in obtaining a position fix for a given request. Further in response an LLM may direct one or more SSCs which direct one or more SSMs to use one or more positioning resources to support obtaining a position fix for the given request. Hence a positioning resource may provide applicable information e.g. measurements etc. back up through the hierarchical processing scheme and or otherwise to LEs . ULM may subsequently provide a position fix to a requesting application in response to the given request. As further illustrated by the dashed arrows and respectively attributes and or states associated with one or more positioning resources obtained by an SSC provided to ULM via an applicable LMM .

As discussed above an application may provide certain desired characteristics for position fix that it requests. If there are multiple concurrent applications a application may have its own desired characteristics which may or may not be distinct from those of other applications. Thus certain desired characteristics may apply only to a particular application that specifies a request. If an application doesn t specify its particular desired characteristics via request for position fix one or more default characteristics may be assigned to it. Table 2 below summarizes some example desired characteristics that may be attributed to a particular currently operating application. In certain example implementations one or more attributes for a positioning resource may also be indicative of similar information in the form of one or more position fix criteria that may be provided by the positioning resource.

One particular desired characteristic position fix criteria as identified in Table 2 is a preferred response time or time to fix. As shown in certain preferred response times may be defined differently depending at least in part on whether the position fix criteria specifies a single shot position fix or periodic position fixes. Here a preferred response time for single shot may be defined by just a single value PRT e.g. as illustrated in timeline . For a periodic position fix however a preferred response time may be defined for a first position fix and minimum intervals MIs may be defined for the following position fixes as illustrated in timeline . By way of further example shows an example timeline comprising minimum intervals of one second. It should be kept in mind however that while such timelines provide certain examples in certain other example implementations positioning fixes for one or more applications may be scheduled in other ways which may or may not result in a defined periodicity. Thus for example in certain implementations it may be useful to schedule certain position fixes at times based at least in part on one or more mathematical functions or formulas which may or may not be distributed evenly over a period of time.

As discussed above LMMs may for example forward messages from time to time indicating attributes and or states of a positioning resource . Some examples of items in such messages are shown in Table 3 below 

To obtain information representative of an attribute and or a state associated with a positioning resource an LMM may request such information from an applicable SSC . The clickable SSC may then respond with a message to LMM as represented by dashed line in and which may be based on the example information as shown in Table 4 below 

To obtain information attribute and state information associated with a particular SSM and associated positioning resource an SSC may request such information from SSM . In response to such a request the SSM may respond to the requesting SSC with information indicating certain attributes and or states associated with positioning resources e.g. based on one or more examples as shown in Table 5 below 

As discussed above an LMM may communicate with one or more SSCs and one or more LECs . For example LMM may provide on or off messages to either an SSC or an LEC to activate enable and or power on associated SSMs and positioning resources as well as LECs and LEs .

As discussed above an LMM may obtain certain attributes and or states associated with modes of operation of mobile device and or one or more positioning resources . In one example a Wi Fi mode of operation and status associated with Wi Fi based positioning resource may be defined by a cold start e.g. without appropriate tiles indicating locations of access points within range a hot start e.g. with appropriate tiles indicating locations of access points within range an unknown start mode with tiles but not certain whether the particular tiles are correct . Wi Fi related attributes for an initial position fix may be shown in Table 6 below according to a particular non limiting example.

Similarly a GNSS mode of operation for GNSS ME positioning resource and status may be defined as one or more of a cold start a hot start a warm start an assisted GNSS or possibly as in acquisition. Particular attributes associated with these different modes of operation may be summarized by particular examples as shown in Table 7 below 

For cellular sector ID based positioning resources particular modes of operation may include for example a cold start without appropriate base station almanac information including for example locations of base stations and associated identification information a hot start with appropriate base station almanac information or an unknown start mode with base station almanac information with uncertainty as to whether the particular base station almanac information is correct . Particular attributes for these particular modes of operation may be illustrated by example in Table 8 below 

In a particular implementation an LMM may support only a single command from ULM at any particular time and a newly received command may override an existing command. In a particular implementation ULM may send commands to an LMM particular instances if ULM is attempting to change current behavior of the LMM . Accordingly if ULM selects the same LMM for multiple applications having different desired characteristics identified in their respective requests for position fix ULM may merge multiple desired characteristics into a single command to be sent to LMM for controlling a particular selected position determination methodology. In a particular example ULM may determine particular parameters from multiple desired characteristics such as a preferred response time or next expected fix time. For response time for example a position determination methodology may include identifying a minimum value of preferred response times defined in a request for position fix for which ULM is selecting this particular LMM . In other words a shortest preferred response time from among multiple current request for multiple application may be selected as the particular parameter representing a desired characteristic. A minimum value of a next expected fix report time of the current location clients may be selected for this particular LMM . Here from a particular parameter representing the desired character mistake a next expected fix report for all active clients may be determined. To meet the requirements of all active clients a minimum value of the next expected fix report times may be selected as the next report time for this particular LMM .

In a particular implementation a GNSS ME based positioning resource may be used in combination with Wi Fi based positioning resource e.g. while initiating a GNSS ME from a cold start. For example if the position uncertainty is less than a predetermined threshold it may be desirable to operate a Wi Fi positioning resource to possibly reduce the position uncertainty. After a position fix is computed from information or measurements provided by WiFi positioning resource the GNSS ME positioning resource may continue without the Wi Fi positioning resource.

According to an implementation ULM may evaluate position determination methodologies associated with LMMs according to certain events or conditions subject to desired characteristic defined by outstanding request from applications as discussed above. Such events or conditions may include for example addition of a new current application an application having been deleted or completed a final position fix having been reported a new position fix is desired in the near future desired characteristics having been modified somehow e.g. via a new request a time out condition having been reached and or particular attribute and or state having changed just to name a few examples. In a particular implementation ULM may select an appropriate position determination methodology associated relating to one or more positioning resources and an LMM by maintaining and propagating a subsequent expected fix information of outstanding location client applications .

As discussed above in certain example implementations ULM may select an LMM to obtain a position fix meeting desired characteristics in a request from among multiple LMMs . According to a particular implementation ULM may select a particular LMM from among LMMs that are available e.g. not related to being in a sleep or failed state according to a multi stage approach. First if a request for position fix forces a particular operational mode that forces use of a particular LMM e.g. the particular LMM is specified by desired characteristics established by the requesting application or a time to fix requirement or goal forces selection of a particular available LMM ULM will attempt to select that particular LMM . Second if no such operational mode forces use of a particular LMM ULM may select from among available LMMs that provide position accuracy that meets an accuracy goal or requirement of position fix criteria established by the requesting application . If none of the available LMMs are capable of meeting or exceeding such an accuracy goal or requirement ULM may select an LMM deemed to be capable of providing the best available position accuracy.

Otherwise if multiple available LMMs are capable of meeting or exceeding an accuracy goal or requirement established by one or more desired characteristics in a request from an application ULM may select an LMM that has already been selected to provide a position fix to satisfy a request from another application in addition to being capable of meeting or exceeding the accuracy goal or requirement to thereby share the LMM if certain conditions are met. For example if the expected time to obtain a position fix using a selected LMM to satisfy a request of a first application is within a time to fix requirement of a request of a second application a position fix provided by the selected LMM may be shared and used in response to the first and second applications.

If multiple candidate LMMs are available and capable of meeting or exceeding an accuracy goal or requirement as indicated by one or more desired characteristics in a request from an application ULM may select from among these LMMs that is likely to consume the least amount of battery resources.

Attention is drawn next to is a flow diagram illustrating an example method or process that may be implemented in a mobile device and or computing platform to make selective use of one or more available positioning resources in accordance with an example implementation.

At example block one or more attributes and or states associated each of a plurality of positioning resources available at the mobile device may be identified. For example one or more attributes and or states may be indicative of one or more position fix criteria e.g. such as an expected power consumption an expected achievable time to fix an expected achievable position accuracy an expected position availability an expected position format a use policy a security policy a preference policy and or the like or some combination thereof. By way of example or more attributes and or states may be identified which are associated with one or more of an SPS based positioning resource an AFLT based positioning resource a cell sector based positioning resource a wireless network based positioning resource a near field communication based positioning resource an ad hoc network based positioning resource and or the like or some combination thereof.

At example block one or more requests for a position fix of the mobile device may be obtained. Example a request for a position fix may be obtained from one or more applications functions operating at least in part on the mobile device and or a computing platform provided there in. In certain instances for example at block a plurality of requests may be combined into and or otherwise handled as a single request. In certain instances for example at block at least one request may be obtained via an application programming interface.

At example at block at least one of the positioning resources may be selected for use in obtaining a position fix based at least in part on the request and the one or more attributes states. In certain instances for example at block certain desired characteristic s relating to a request for position fix may be compared to or otherwise applied to a gains one or more attributes states. In certain instances for example at block it may be determined whether or not a recent position fix satisfies a current request for position fix. In certain instances for example at block a position fix may be selected from a plurality of obtained position fixes.

In accordance with certain further example implementations the techniques provided herein may be used to support multiple applications executing concurrently on a mobile device which may request and receive position estimates and or position fixes. Here for example in certain instances applications may have different associated fix criteria or requirements and or goals associated with the position fixes that they desire. In order to meet otherwise possibly exceed the fix criteria of all active outstanding applications ULM may for example evaluate the position determination methodologies indicated by the attributes of available positioning resources with regard to the desired characteristics of a position fix requested by the applications and select appropriate positioning resources to execute. For example a positioning resource may be selected in response to one or more of the following events a new requesting application having been added a requesting application having been deleted a request having been completed a position fix having been reported or otherwise made available a new position fix being requested and or needed soon one or more positioning resource and or LMM attributes and or states having been modified a timeout event having been reached and or the like or some combination thereof.

In certain example implementations in requesting a position fix from ULM an application may experience a latency in receiving a position fix. Such latency may arise from a time to fix associated with a particular positioning resource selected for obtaining a position fix. As such while servicing a current request for a position fix from a first application ULM may receive subsequent requests for position fixes from one or more other applications . With the understanding that ULM may concurrently service requests for position fixes from multiple applications to select appropriate positioning resource s ULM may in certain instances maintain and propagate a subsequent expected fix information of all active outstanding requesting applications. Here for example such information may indicate a next expected fix time NEFT for each application that reported at least one final fix and or a preferred response time for each application that doesn t have any final fix yet. In certain example instances ULM may assume that a next expected fix time is equal to preferred response time plus a current time. ULM may for example obtain one or more attributes and or statuses of positioning resources e.g. as illustrated below in Table 9.

In certain example implementations too select an appropriate positioning resource ULM may sort outstanding request applications based at least in part according to some ranking order. For example a ranking order may consider whether a positioning resource may or may not be dictated for a particular application e.g. that may force a particular operation mode. For example a ranking order may consider whether a positioning resource may or may not be dedicated for a request having a desired characteristic relating to a highest position fix accuracy e.g. HOR POS ACCURACY BEST . For example a ranking order may consider whether a positioning resource may or may not be dedicated for a request for a high position fix accuracy e.g. HOR POS ACCURACY HIGH . For example a ranking order may consider whether a positioning resource may or may not be dedicated for a request for a medium position fix accuracy e.g. HOR POS ACCURACY MEDIUM . For example a ranking order may consider whether a positioning resource may or may not be dedicated for a request for a low position fix accuracy e.g. HOR POS ACCURACY LOW . For example a ranking order may consider whether a positioning resource may or may be indicative of any particular accuracy e.g. HOR POS ACCURACY DONT CARE .

Consequently for example if multiple applications have requested the same preferred hor pos accuracy ULM may in certain instances sort these requests based at least in part on the next expected fix time in ascending order.

Further in certain implementations ULM may select a positioning resource for servicing each current request for a position fix from an application one by one according to a multiple act process e.g. similar to and or as illustrated in the example below. Here ULM may sequentially apply acts 1 through 5 for determining how a particular request may be serviced e.g. should one or more of the previously mentioned events occur

In an example act 1 a forced operation mode may be selected. Here for example a request for position fix from a client application may specify a particular positioning resource to be used e.g. not merely indicating desired characteristics that may relate to certain position fix criteria such as accuracy and time to fix . If a request from a client application forces an operation mode ULM may for example select the forced positioning resource for servicing this request.

In an example act 2 a positioning resource that meets or exceeds certain desired characteristics may be selected. For example if a client application does not force any specific operation mode ULM may select positioning resource s from among available positioning resources that may be capable of satisfying the desired characteristics and or exceeding the desired characteristics of a request. For example a positioning resource may provide a desired requested or better than the requested position accuracy e.g. as further illustrated by a non limiting example in the following Table 10 below.

If there is no positioning resource s that can meet the position accuracy requirement and or other like desired characteristics pertaining to request ULM may for example select the positioning resource that may provide the best or closest match e.g. best available position accuracy etc. Here for example ULM may select positioning resources using the following orders very high followed by high followed by medium followed by low which may be followed by very low.

If multiple positioning resources may satisfy desired characteristic e.g. meet a position accuracy requirement etc. ULM may for example select at least one of the positioning resources based on the positioning resource being able to meet a TTFF requirement. If there is only one positioning resource and it is in FAILED state ULM may for example select another positioning method that may provide the best available position accuracy and which is not in a FAILED or NOT AVAILABLE state.

In example act 3 it may be determined whether one or more requests applications may share a positioning resource and or position fix there from.

As discussed above ULM may service request for position fixes from multiple client applications concurrently. In particular implementations these multiple requests may be serviced by a single position fix to thereby share a position resource under certain conditions. Hence for example following example acts 1 and two above if there are still multiple available positioning resources meeting the desired characteristics e.g. position accuracy TTFF requirements and or the like of a request for a position fix ULM may for example select one or more positioning resources that may already have been selected for use in servicing other requests and which are not deemed FAILED or NOT AVAILABLE. In one example implementation a decision to select of a positioning resource currently being used for the other previous requests may be based at least in part on a next expected time to fix NEFT associated with the particular request or client application making request and NEFT associated with the positioning methodology currently being used for the other position requests as follows NEFT of this client NEFT of this positioning method . 5 seconds or other suitable time measurement.

In the particular example above a location client application may be allowed to share a positioning resource with other client applications if it is not necessary to start the shared positioning resource too much earlier e.g. 5 seconds or other suitable time measurement than already scheduled for servicing requests from other client applications.

A NEFT of a positioning method may for example be estimated as follows max expected TTFF current time min NEFT of all clients selected this positioning method .

To recap in certain example implementations a positioning resource servicing a previous request for a position fix may be used in servicing a new position fix request if certain conditions exist. One condition may be that an expected accuracy of a position determination methodology used in servicing the previous request meets an accuracy requirement of the new position fix request. Another condition may be that a NEFT of the new position fix request is sufficiently close in time to a NEFT of the positioning resource servicing the previous position fix request.

Accordance with certain aspects it may be observed that a position determination methodology may consume resources e.g. battery life limited resources for processing signals in real time etc. in the course of servicing a request for a position fix. In a particular implementation a process of obtaining a position fix for servicing a previous position determination request may be conditionally suspended or cancelled if a position determination methodology to service a new position determination request from another application has been selected. For example if the position determination methodology selected to service the new position determination request has an expected accuracy and or expected time to fix meeting requirements of the previous position fix request the process for servicing the previous request may be cancelled. Here a position fix obtained using the position determination methodology for servicing the new request may meet accuracy and timeliness of the previous request for position fix. Accordingly an early cancellation of the process for obtaining the position fix for servicing the previous request may conserve resources.

In example act 4 a positioning resource considered to consume the least amount of electrical power may be selected. Here for example the following acts 1 3 if there are still multiple positioning resources that meet the position accuracy and TTFF requirements e.g. and or other desired characteristics ULM may select the positioning resource s that may provide the lowest power consumption among these candidates. If there are still multiple candidates ULM may select any one of them.

In example act 5 a positioning resource with better than requested accuracy may be selected e.g. if a positioning resource selected for the client application fails meet accuracy requirement. Here for example if a positioning resource selected for a client application request fails to meet the accuracy requirement continuously ULM may change its preferred hor pos accuracy value to request better accuracy. For example if the original preferred hor pos accuracy field is set to HOR POS ACCURACY MEDIUM ULM shall change it to HOR POS ACCURACY HIGH when the continuous failure is detected. ULM may for example count the number of continuous failures and declare failed continuously when the counter reaches a particular threshold. ULM may for example reset such a counter when a position fix from an original request meets the desired characteristic for such accuracy requirement.

Thus accordance with certain implementations a mobile device may identify a plurality of position determination methodologies available and their current attributes and or states for servicing requests for position fixes from a plurality applications hosted on the mobile device and schedule at least one available positioning resource to service a new request for a position fix from an application concurrently with a process to serve a previous request for a position fix from one or more other applications.

In certain example implementations a mobile device may selectively schedule a positioning resource s servicing the previous request to also service a new request if a difference between NEFT of the new request and NEFT of the positioning resource servicing the previous request is less than a threshold.

In certain example implementations a mobile device may selectively use a position fix obtained from servicing a previous request for position fix to service a new request for position fix if an expected accuracy of the position fix meets an accuracy requirement and or other desired characteristic s of the new request.

In certain example implementations a mobile device may selectively terminate a positioning resource that may be currently servicing a previous request for a position fix and may apply a position fix obtained from one or more other positioning resources to satisfy one or more previous request for position fix.
