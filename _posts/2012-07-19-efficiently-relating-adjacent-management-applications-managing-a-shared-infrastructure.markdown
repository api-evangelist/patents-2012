This application is a continuation of commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 352 746 filed Jan. 18 2012 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

This invention relates in general to management applications managing a shared infrastructure in a computing environment and more particularly to efficiently relating adjacent management applications of different disciplines managing a shared infrastructure by identifying only the optimal resources and relationships between resources needed to build linkage between the management applications.

In many complex computing environments different teams will manage different disciplines of resources within the complex computing environment. For example one team manages the server infrastructure another team manages the application infrastructure another team manages the storage infrastructure and another team manages the network infrastructure where servers application storage and networks each represent a different discipline. Each management team manages a selection of resources using discipline specific tools and management applications.

Within the complex computing environment the different disciplines of resources are interrelated therefore effective management of adjacent disciplines requires establishing linkages between the teams and each team s management applications. In one example a virtualized network switch that runs on a server is visible to both a server management application and an adjacent network management application therefore for effective management of the visible virtualized network switch a linkage identifying the virtualized network switch needs to be established between the server management application and the network management application.

In view of the foregoing as the number of resources and complexity of relationships within a complex computing environment grows there is a need for a method for efficiently relating adjacent management applications managing a shared infrastructure.

In one embodiment a method for relating a first management application and an adjacent management application both managing at least one common resource in a computing environment includes a step for analyzing by a computer system for a first management application managing at least one common resource with a second management application adjacent to the first management application within a computing environment including multiple resources and relationships a resource and relationship model known by the first management application of a selection of resources and relationships managed by the first management application from among the multiple resources and relationships in the computing environment by identifying for the first management application comprising a network management application the at least one common resource comprising at least one virtualized network switch application comprising a server management application in a second resource and relationship model of a second selection of resources and relationships managed by the second management application from among the plurality of resources and relationships wherein only a first portion of the first selection of resources and relationships is the same as a second portion of the second selection of resources and relationships from among the plurality of resources and relationships in a computing environment wherein the network management application primarily manages a network infrastructure in the computing environment in a layer adjacent to a server infrastructure in the computing environment wherein the server management application primarily manages the server infrastructure. The method comprises a step for identifying by a computer system for the first management application only a minimal set of resources and relationships within the resource and relationship model providing at least one optimal linkage point between the first management application and the second management application as to the at least one common resource by identifying only the minimal set of resources and relationships within the first selection of resources and relationships and the second selection of resources and relationships providing at least one optimal linkage point between the first management application within the first selection of resources and relationships and the second management application within the second selection of resources and relationships as to the at least one common resource wherein the minimal set of resources and relationships does not include all the resources and relationships between the first management application and the second management application. The method comprises a step for outputting by a computer system the minimal set of resources and relationships to the second management application such that the server management application is informed within the minimal set of resources and relationships of at least one linkage resource within the first selection of resources and relationships that is not included in the second selection of resources and relationships managed by the second management application and is required to provide the at least one optimal linkage point between the network management application and the server management application through the at least one virtualized network switch.

In another embodiment a system for relating a first management application and an adjacent management application both managing at least one common resource in a computing environment comprises a memory and a processor coupled to the memory. The system comprises a linkage controller operative on the processor to analyze for a first management application managing at least one common resource with a second management application adjacent to the first management application within a computing environment comprising plurality of resources and relationships a resource and relationship model known by the first management application of a selection of resources and relationships managed by the first management application from among the plurality of resources and relationships by identifying for the first management application comprising a network management application the at least one common resource comprising at least one virtualized network switch operating at a layer of the computing environment also known by the second management application comprising server management application in a second resource and relationship model of a second selection of resources and relationships managed by the second management application from among the plurality of resources and relationships wherein only a first portion of the first selection of resources and relationships is the same as a second portion of the second selection of resources and relationships from among the plurality of resources and relationships in a computing environment wherein the network management application primarily manages a network infrastructure in the computing environment in a layer adjacent to a server infrastructure in the computing environment wherein the server management application primarily manages the server infrastructure. The system comprises the linkage controller operative to identify for the first management application only a minimal set of resources and relationships within the resource and relationship model providing at least one optimal linkage point between the first management application and the second management application as to the at least one common resource by identifying only the minimal set of resources and relationships within the first selection of resources and relationships and the second selection of resources and relationships providing at least one optimal linkage point between the first management application within the first selection of resources and relationships and the second management application within the second selection of resources and relationships as to the at least one common resource wherein the minimal set of resources and relationships does not include all the resources and relationships between the first management application and the second management application. The system comprises the linkage controller operative to output the minimal set of resources and relationships to the second management application such that the server management application is informed within the minimal set of resources and relationships of at least one linkage resource within the first selection of resources and relationships that is not included in the second selection of resources and relationships managed by the second management application and is required to provide the at least one optimal linkage point between the network management application and the server management application through the at least one virtualized network switch.

In another embodiment a computer program product for relating a first management application and an adjacent management application both managing at least one common resource in a computing environment is tangibly embodied in a non transitory computer readable storage medium. The computer program product includes computer executable instructions which cause a computer to analyze for a first management application managing at least one common resource with a second management application adjacent to the first management application within a computing environment comprising a plurality of resources and relationships a resource and relationship model known by the first management application of a selection of resources and relationships managed by the first management application from among the plurality of resources and relationships by identifying for the first management application comprising a network management application the at least one common resource comprising at least one virtualized network switch operating at a layer of the computing environment also known by the second management application comprising a server management application in a second resource and relationship model of a second selection of resources and relationships managed by the second management application from among the plurality of resources and relationships wherein only a first portion of the first selection of resources and relationships is the same as a second portion of the second selection of resources and relationships from among the plurality of resources and relationships in a computing environment wherein the network management application primarily manages a network infrastructure in the computing environment in a layer adjacent to a server infrastructure in the computing environment wherein the server management application primarily manages the server infrastructure. The computer program product includes computer executable instructions which cause a computer to identify for the first management application only a minimal set of resources and relationships within the resource and relationship model providing at least one optimal linkage point between the first management application and the second management application as to the at least one common resource by identifying only the minimal set of resources and relationships within the first selection of resources and relationships and the second selection of resources and relationships providing at least one optimal linkage point between the first management application within the first selection of resources and relationships and the second management application within the second selection of resources and relationships as to the at least one common resource wherein the minimal set of resources and relationships does not include all the resources and relationships between the first management application and the second management application. The computer program product includes computer executable instructions which cause a computer to output the minimal set of resources and relationships to the second management application such that the server management application is informed within the minimal set of resources and relationships of at least one linkage resource within the first selection of resources and relationships that is not included in the second selection of resources and relationships managed by the second management application and is required to provide the at least one optimal linkage point between the network management application and the server management application through the at least one virtualized network switch.

In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

In addition in the following description for purposes of explanation numerous systems are described. It is important to note and it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may execute in a variety of systems including a variety of computer systems and electronic devices operating any number of different types of operating systems.

With reference now to the figures and in particular with reference now to a block diagram illustrates one example of a computing infrastructure in which each management application determines a set of optimal resources and relationships for efficiently relating to adjacent management applications in a computing environment.

In the example a computing environment may include multiple infrastructure layers each focused on a separate discipline and each managed by one or more discipline specific management applications. In the example a network infrastructure including a virtualized network switch is managed by a network management application . Network management application may include but is not limited to Tivoli Network Manager Computer Associates Spectrum Infrastructure Manager Hewlett Packard Network Node Manager Multi Router Traffic Grapher VMware and Fiber Channel over Ethernet and may include management for virtualized network switches and other networking technologies. In addition in the example a server infrastructure including a server is managed by a server management application . Server management application may include but is not limited to Tivoli Monitoring Tivoli Monitoring for Virtualized Environments Zabbix and may include management of Operating Systems and middleware such as Websphere or DB2 Hypervisors and other server resident functions. In addition in the example an application infrastructure including a virtual application is managed by an application management application . Applicants management application may include but is not limited to Tivoli Composite Application Manager Hewlett Packard Application Performance Management Computer Associates Application Performance Management or Helios and may include management for virtual applications composite applications and traditional commercial applications.

In the example server management application is an adjacent application to each of network management application and applications management application . In the example while network management application and applications management application are not adjacent management applications network management application and applications management application are associated with each other through the most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships identified between adjacent applications for an application adjacent to both network management application and applications management application such as server management application . In the example management disciplines that are not adjacent to one another may still be associated through the most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships determined for adjacent applications in each management discipline providing an environment for linking adjacent and associated network server client application and storage management disciplines together.

In the example one or more resources within network infrastructure are resources that are commonly managed by adjacent management applications. For example virtualized network switch which runs on server is a resource on Open Systems Interconnection OSI layer 2 commonly managed by both network management application and server management application . In the example while network infrastructure is illustrated showing virtualized network switch on OSI layer 2 as the resource commonly managed by network management application and server management application in other examples network infrastructure may include additional or alternate physical or virtualized network devices including but not limited to switches routers firewalls and load balancers and one or more of the additional or alternate physical or virtualized network devices may be commonly managed by network management application and server management application . In addition as referred to herein virtualized network switch may represent additional or alternate physical or virtualized network devices including but not limited to switches routers firewalls and load balancers. In the example server and other elements of server infrastructure may represent one or more physical servers and one or more virtual servers and may also represent one or more client systems. In addition as referred to herein server may represent additional or alternate physical servers and virtual servers or one or more client systems.

In another example virtual application which runs on server is a resource on OSI layer 7 commonly managed by both server management application and applications management application . In the example while application infrastructure is illustrated showing virtual application on OSI layer 7 as the resource commonly managed by both server management application and applications management application in other examples application infrastructure may include additional or alternate applications or virtual applications and one or more of the additional or alternate applications may be commonly managed by server management application and applications management application .

Because each management application manages one or more resources within computing environment each management application has an awareness of at least a portion of the topology of computing environment managed by the management application but may not be aware of the entire topology of computing environment . The topology of computing environment includes both the resources within computing environment and the relationships between the resources. In the example the portion of the topology of computing environment known by network management application is illustrated as network resource and relationship R R model the portion of the topology of computing environment known by server management application is illustrated as server R R model and the portion of the topology of computing environment known by applications management application is illustrated as application app R R model . While computing environment is illustrated with network management application server management application and applications management application a computing environment may include management applications for additional or alternate areas including but not limited to storage management applications and security management applications.

Network R R model may include for example detailed information about the network resources and relationships between network resources managed in network infrastructure but only basic information about the servers managed in server infrastructure such as knowing which servers are connected to network switches in network infrastructure and not any information about any of the applications in application infrastructure that are running on servers in server infrastructure . Server R R model may include for example detailed information about the managed server resources and relationships between server resources in server infrastructure but only basic information about the switches the servers are connected to in network infrastructure and only basic information about the applications running on the servers and not any information about the routing and switching relationships in network infrastructure nor any information about the business services provided by applications in application infrastructure . Application R R model may include for example detailed information about the managed applications running in application infrastructure but only basic information about the managed servers on which application run in server infrastructure and no information about network infrastructure .

In the example because virtualized network switch is commonly managed by management applications for different disciplines which may further be managed by separate teams to reconcile management of virtualized network switch a linkage needs to be established as to virtualized network switch between network management application and server management application . In the example network management application analyzes the portion of the topology known to network management application in network R R model and identifies a minimal set of resources and relationships from network R R model necessary to tie network management application to server management application for the commonly managed resource of virtualized network switch at OSI layer 2. Network management application outputs the identified set of resources and relationships in an optimized linkage file where the identified set of resources and relationships represents the most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships network management application determines are required to link network management application to server management application as to virtualized network switch .

In addition in the example because virtual application is commonly managed by management applications for different disciplines to reconcile management of virtual application a linkage needs to be established as to virtual application between applications management application and server management application . In the example server management application analyzes the portion of the topology known to server management application in server R R model and identifies a minimal set of resources and relationships from server R R model necessary to tie server management application to applications management application for the commonly managed resource of virtual application at OSI layer 7. Server management application outputs the identified minimal set of resources and relationships in an optimized linkage file where the identified set of resources and relationships represents the most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships server management application determines are required to link server management application to applications management application .

In the example where network management application is described as outputting optimized linkage file and server management application is described as outputting optimized linkage file each with a most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships in other examples network management application and server management application may output the most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships by writing the optimized linkage file to disk or by exposing the most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships through other mechanisms including but not limited to application programming interfaces APIs multicasting and database queries of tables containing the data.

In one example the minimal set of resources and relationships which represents the most optimal and consumable set of resources required to link adjacent management applications is also the minimal intersect of resources required to link adjacent management applications. In particular since each management application has a limited visibility of the entire topology of computing environment when determining a minimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of management applications a management application need only identify the necessary resources and relationships necessary to tie management disciplines together rather than identifying all resources and relationships between two management applications. In one example the most optimal and consumable resources are identified by management applications as a set of resources and relationships within the overlapping resources and relationships known in the resource and relationship models of adjacent management applications which provide a path for linkage of the management applications. A set of resources and relationships is most consumable when only the resources and relationships required to form an appropriate linkage between management applications are included in the set of resources and relationships.

In one example in determining the minimal set of resources and relationships necessary for linkage of management applications as the set of resources and relationships identified by a management application shifts from the commonly known resources by the management application and an adjacent management application to the resources from the management application discipline only the value and consumability of the resources with respect to the linkage decreases. For example if network management application is determining the minimal set of resources and relationships for linkage to server with respect to virtualized network switch as network management application moves from a starting device or seed device known in both server R R model and network R R model to a first level of switches or routers of the network discipline known by both application and then to a second level of switches or routers only known by network management application in network R R model the value and consumability of the second level of switches and routers as to the linkage determination decreases.

In one example in determining the minimal set of resources and relationships necessary for linkage of management application a management application may adjust the starting point devices and the depth or number of hops taken within the known topology. By adjusting the starting point devices and number of hops a management application may further direct and specify the selection of resources and relationships to identify as the minimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of the management application with an adjacent application. In one example the starting devices may be set to include a particular type of device such as a set of servers. In another example the starting point devices may be set to include all devices with less than a configured number of connections. For example the configured number of connections may be set to two connections.

In the example while only a generalized topology of computing environment is illustrated even the minimal set of resources and relationships in optimized linkage files and may include a significant number of resources and relationships between resources. As the size of computing environment scales up the number of resources and relationships between resources increases and the need to efficiently determine the minimal set of resources and relationships for linking disparate management applications increases. By analyzing the portion of the topology of computing environment already known to a management application to determine the minimal resources and relationships for linking to an adjacent management application regardless of the size of computing environment the management applications themselves efficiently determine the optimal selection of the most consumable resources and relationships that serve as a linkage point to adjacent management applications.

In contrast to the example illustrated in a separate centralized management database may maintain resource and relationship information for computing environment as a whole and provide a naming and reconciliation service for analyzing the resources and relationships in computing environment identifying resources that are commonly managed by adjacent management applications naming the commonly managed resource with a consistent identifier and providing a subset of all the resources and relationships between management applications as to the commonly managed resource for relating management application. Each management application receiving the subset of all resources and relationships still has to determine from the subset a set of resources and relationships that form an appropriate linkage between the management applications. Maintaining a separate centralized management database with all the resource and relationship information for computing environment and providing a naming and reconciliation service for providing linkage information to management applications may be efficient when computing environment is a small computing environment however as the size of the environment increases the resources required to maintain a management database and analyze the resources and relationships in the management database increase significantly. In addition as the size of an environment increases it may become impractical to store all the topology information about computing environment is one management database. Further to maintain a centralized management database each management application still has to report the resource and relationship information known by each management application to the management database. Moreover to maintain a centralized management database in a large computing environment the detail of information stored about each resource may be limited. In addition as to maintain a centralized management database the time required for a management application to receive a subset of resources and relationships requires time and resources to send the request to and receive a response from the naming and reconciliation service and requires time and resources for the naming and reconciliation service to search the centralized management database.

In the example in each management application uses the resources and relationship information already known by the management application to manage resources in order to identify a minimal set of resources and relationships to link to an adjacent application managing a common resource rather than having to report resource and relationship information to a centralized management database query the centralized management database for a subset of all the resources and relationships between management application and identify an appropriate linkage within the subset. In addition in the example in each management application determines the most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships and includes set of resources and relationships in the optimized linkage with each resource and relationships described at the level of detail known by the management application managing the resources. Further in the example in each management application automates the identification of which resources and relationships are necessary to link the management application to an adjacent management application and provides flexibility in determining which types of resources and relationships to identify for reconciliation purposes.

With reference now to a block diagram illustrates one example of a complex computing environment for providing end to end business services supported by clients and servers applications routers switches and routing protocols in which one or more management applications manage one or more common resources. In the example a computing environment illustrates one example of a Multiprotocol Label Switching MPLS virtual private network enabled by MPLS core provider network and virtual private network VPN 4 . In one example of a MPLS VPN a provider network links one or more customer networks where edge routers between networks carry customer routing information providing optimal routing for traffic belonging to the customer for inter site traffic.

In one example computing environment includes multiple resources and relationships within each infrastructure discipline including a network infrastructure a server infrastructure and an application and business services infrastructure and each discipline may be managed by a disparate management application. For example a network infrastructure within computing environment may include resources protocols and relationships including but not limited to switch switch MP iBGP Virtual Routing Table VRF customer A MP iBGP VRF customer A and routers labeled as CEa and CEz which are routers in a customer network that interface with the service provider network routers PEa and PEz which are routers in the provider network that interface or connect to the customer edge routers in the customer network and router P which is the provider controlled domain consisting of provider edge and provider core routers that connect sites belonging to the customer on a shared infrastructure atop which control plane and data plane route data. In addition for example a server infrastructure within computing environment may include resources and relationships including but not limited to servers and and client systems and . In addition for example an application and business service infrastructure within computing environment may include business services .

In addition computing environment is further distinguished by a first customer environment that includes servers and client system switch and router CEa . In the example a second customer environment in computing environment includes switch servers and client system and router CEz .

In addition computing environment may include resources that are commonly managed by adjacent management applications where the adjacent management applications each primarily manage a particular discipline of resources. For example Network Management Application may manage physical networking components such as switches and logical networking constructs such as VPN4 attached server components such as servers and attached client components such as client systems and and virtual networking components such as a vSwitch that may exist in one or more of servers or . In the example server management application may also manage the physical servers such as servers and as well as hypervisor s and vSwitchs that may exist in servers and 

With reference now to a block diagram illustrates one example of a management application for generating an optimized linkage file specifying a minimal set of resources and relationships necessary for linkage between one management application and an adjacent management application managing a shared resource.

As illustrated a management application such as network management application server management application or applications management application includes a linkage controller . While linkage controller is illustrated as a component of management application as described herein a linkage controller operating through a management service separate from management application may access management application resource and relationship model and also perform the functions described with respect to linkage controller for management application .

In response to one or more types of inputs linkage controller is called for reconciling the identification of a shared resource by management application and adjacent management application . Linkage controller generates an optimized linkage file including a most optimal and consumable set of resources and relationships for linkage between management application and adjacent management application as to the shared resource.

In one example linkage controller is triggered by an input such as a linkage trigger to trigger linkage controller to generate optimized linkage file . In the example linkage trigger includes one or more parameters including but not limited to an identification of the shared resources an identification of the adjacent application a characteristic parameter for focusing the selection of optimal resources and relationships and a depth parameter for limiting the depth of selection of optimal resources and relationships from starting point devices. In one example the shared resource may further identify an OSI layer associated with the shared resource or linkage controller may determine the OSI layer associated with the shared resource from model . In one example the characteristic parameter may include a selection of a management discipline specific topology setting or a generalized topology setting and may include additional values for customizing the application of each type of topology setting. For example for a generalized topology setting a configurable number of connections to other devices may be set to a configured number. Management application or another application or service may automatically generate linkage trigger . In addition a user managing management application may specify one or more of the parameters of linkage trigger .

In the example linkage controller analyzes a management application resource and relationship model where management application resource and relationship model represents the topological awareness of management application of a topology of a computing environment based on the portion of the total resources and relationships within the computing environment that are managed by management application . In the example management application resource and relationship model may include one or more of managed resources with information about the resources managed by management application resource properties with information about managed resources and other resources within the computing environment and resource relationships with information about the connective relationships of managed resources and other resources within the computing environment.

Linkage controller analyzes area resource and relationship model and identifies from among all the resources and relationships between the management application and the adjacent management application as illustrated at reference numeral an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage between the disparate management applications as illustrated at reference numeral . Linkage controller specifies the optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage as illustrated at reference numeral within optimized linkage file and outputs optimized linkage file to adjacent management application or to a service that passes optimized linkage file to adjacent management application . In the example in addition to linkage controller outputting the optimal set of resources and relationships in optimized linkage file to another management application linkage controller may also write optimized linkage file to disk or exposing the optimal set of resources and relationships to other management applications or other components through other mechanisms including but not limited to application programming interfaces APIs multicasting and database queries of tables containing the data.

In analyzing management application resource and relationship model linkage controller determines a starting point within model and traverses the resources and relationships from the starting point based on a selected topology characteristic setting as further customized by any characteristic parameters in linkage trigger . In one example if the characteristic parameter in linkage trigger is set to the management discipline specific topology setting then linkage controller applies management discipline specific topology characteristic settings in analyzing model and if the characteristic parameter in linkage trigger is set to the generalized topology setting then linkage controller applies generalized topology characteristics setting . If no characteristic parameter is set in linkage trigger linkage controller may select to apply one or both of management discipline specific topology characteristic settings and generalized topology characteristic settings . In addition the characteristic parameter in linkage trigger may further specify one or more parameters rules or values to be applied in management discipline specific topology characteristic settings or generalized topology characteristic settings to further customize the selection of optimal resources and relationships within model by linkage controller .

In one example management discipline specific topology characteristic settings specify how to determine a selection of resources as the starting point for determining the minimal set of resources and relationships where the starting point is to include discipline specific resources from the management discipline of the adjacent management application that are the most optimal resources and relationships for linkage to the adjacent application and how to traverse model from the starting point from the most optimal resources and relationships toward suboptimal resources and relationships. In one example management discipline specific topology characteristic settings specify that the starting point should be set to a set of devices of the primary discipline of the adjacent management application which are also known by the management application. For example where the common resource known by a network management application and a server management application is an Ethernet network port and the associated OSI layer 2 network connectivity to the network port under management discipline specific topology characteristic settings linkage controller specifies a starting point of a set of servers managed by the network management application and specifies an OSI layer to provide linkage through as OSI layer 2. In one example linkage trigger may further customize the analysis performed by linkage controller by including a characteristic parameter that specifies the number of servers a type of server or specific set of servers to include in the set of servers as the starting point.

In one example generalized topology characteristic settings specify how to determine a selection of resources as a starting point for determining the minimal set of resources and relationships where the starting point is to include resources and relationships meeting a defined topology characteristic that is generally associated with optimal resources and relationships for an adjacent application and how to traverse model from the starting point from the most optimal resources and relationships toward suboptimal resource and relationships. In the example generalized topology characteristic settings specify that the starting point should be set to a set of devices each having a number of connections to other devices that falls within a specified range. In general certain types of devices within a topology of a computing environment are highly meshed such as network devices and other types of devices within a topology of a computing environment have few connections with other devices such as servers. By setting the starting point to a set of devices with a number of connections within a range of two or fewer devices the starting point will be set to mostly include servers and by setting the starting point to a set of devices with a number of connections within a range of greater than two devices the starting point will be set to mostly include network devices. For example where the common resource known by a network management application and a server management application is the Ethernet network port and the associated OSI layer 2 network connectivity to the network port under generalized topology characteristic settings linkage controller specifies a starting point of a set of devices within model with two or fewer connections to other devices and specifies an OSI layer to provide linkage through as OSI layer 2. In one example linkage trigger may include a characteristic parameter that specifies the range to be applied for determining the devices to include in the start point or that specifies the set of devices to include in the set of devices as the starting point.

In analyzing management application resource and relationship model linkage controller traverses the resources and relationships from the starting point towards suboptimal resources and relationships as limited by depth settings and any additional depth parameters specified in linkage trigger . In one example depth settings specify the number of additional hops to allow from optimal resources and relationships towards suboptimal resources and relationships where within the topology of the computing environment resources directly linked to one another are one hop away from one another. In one example depth settings may specify conditions upon which to allow for additional hops and may further specify the types of devices to allow hops to. In another example depth settings may be further customized by depth parameters in linkage trigger where depth parameters may specify a number of additional hops restrict any additional hops define conditions for allowing additional hops or identify a type of device to include an any additional hop.

With reference now to a block diagram illustrates one example of a management discipline specific topology characteristic based determination of an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of a network management application with an adjacent server management application where the management applications share a virtualized network switch at OSI layer 2. In the example a network management application determines an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of network management application with an adjacent server management application .

In the example a network resource and relationship model is illustrated reflecting the ordering of resources and relationships applied under management discipline specific topology characteristic settings specified for a network management application. In model according to management discipline specific topology characteristic settings the starting point for the optimal linkage determination is set to one or more servers which are the managed resource most optimal to adjacent server management application . As illustrated at reference numeral in model as the set of managed resources used by network management application to try to link to adjacent server management application increases towards resources primarily of the management discipline of network management application consumability and value with respect to integration decreases.

In particular in the example for network management application to determine the optimal resources and relationships for linkage to server management application the starting point for the optimal linkage determination is set to a set of servers managed by network management application such as server server and serverN . A linkage controller of network management application traverses a path from the starting point of the most optimal resources and relationships towards the sub optimal resources and relationships only to a depth allowed and necessary to determine the minimum resources and relationships required for linkage of network management application to server management application . In the example linkage controller of network management application determines the number of additional hops to allow from the optimal resources and relationships of the managed servers to the suboptimal levels of the network infrastructure from a first layer of switch and switch to a next hop to switch and router to an additional hop toward the core of the network to router router router and router N . In the example although the managed resources between network management application and server management application may include switch router router router router and routerN an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of network management application to server management application would not include router router router or routerN and would not include switch or router unless an option is set to include the middle hop devices.

In one example management discipline specific topology code illustrates one example of one or more elements to be performed by a linkage controller of network management application to determine an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage to server management application for a shared resource at OSI layer 2. In the example code defines a set of servers managed by network management application as the starting point let s the set of servers managed by the network management application defines a file to be exported by the network management application let f the file to be exported by the network management application defines an OSI layer to be traversed let L OSI layer 2 and sets an additionalHop variable to specify whether to traverse an additional hop toward the core of the network let additionalHop false . In the example code commands that for each server in the set of servers for each server s in s the server information is added to the file add s to f and defines a set of network devices one hop away from the server at the defined OSI layer let n the set of network devices connected one hop away from s at OSI layer L . Next in the example code commands that for each network device in the set of network devices for each network device n in n the network device is added to the file and related to the server add n to f and relate n to s . In the example code commands that if additionalHop is set to true then a second set of network devices is defined that are one hop away from the network device at the defined OSI layer let n the set of network devices connected 1 hop away from n at OSI layer L and for each of the network devices in the second set the network device in the second set is added to the file and related to the network device in the first set of network devices for each network device n in n add n to f and relate n to n . Finally code commands to write the optimized file to disk write f to disk .

In the example as code is applied to model where additionalHop is set to false only server server server N switch and switch and the relationships between these resources may be among the selection of resources and relationships included in the file. In another example as code is applied to model if additionalHop is set to true an additional hop toward the core of the network may add switch and router and the relationships to switch and router as the second set of network devices written to the file.

With reference now to a block diagram illustrates one example of a generalized topology characteristic based determination of an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of a network management application with an adjacent server management application where the management applications share a virtualized network switch at OSI layer 2. In the example a network management application determines an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of network management application with an adjacent server management application .

In the example a network resource and relationship model is illustrated reflecting the ordering of resources and relationships applied under generalized topology characteristic settings specified for a network management application. In model according to generalized topology characteristic settings the starting point for the optimal linkage determination is set to one or more devices connected to less than a configured number of other devices which are the managed resource most optimal to adjacent server management application . As illustrated at reference numeral in model as the set of managed resources used by network management application to try to link to adjacent server management application increases towards resources with a greater number of connections with other resources or towards resources that are only known by network management application consumability and value with respect to integration decreases.

In particular in the example for network management application to determine the optimal resources and relationships for linkage to server management application the starting point for the optimal linkage determination is set to a set of devices managed by network management application and connected to less than a configured number of other devices where the configured number is set to two. In the example by setting the configured number to two only those devices with only one connection are included as starting point devices where devices with only one connection may include devices on the edge of a network. In one example by setting the configured number of devices to a higher number such as three in a highly redundant environment devices with less than three connections may include devices that are on the edge of shared resources such as a server with multiple network interface cards.

A linkage controller of network management application traverses a path from the starting point of the most optimal resources and relationships towards the sub optimal resources and relationships only to a depth allowed and necessary to determine the minimum resources and relationships required for linkage of network management application to server management application . In the example linkage controller of network management application determines the number of additional hops to allow from the optimal resources and relationships of router server and switch the devices of any type connected to fewer than two other devices to the suboptimal levels of the network infrastructure from a first layer of switch and switch to a next hop to switch and router to an additional hop toward the core of the network to router router router and router N . In the example although the managed resources between network management application and server management application may include switch router router router router and routerN an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage of network management application to server management application would not include router router router or routerN and would not include switch or router unless an option is set to include the middle hop devices.

In one example generalized topology characteristics code illustrates one example of one or more elements to be performed by a linkage controller of network management application to determine an optimal set of resources and relationships for linkage to server management application for a shared resource at OSI layer 2. In the example code defines a set of devices connected to less than two other devices managed by network management application as the starting point let n the set of devices connected to 

In the example as code is applied to model where additionalHop is set to false only router switch switch and switch and the relationships between these resources may be among the selection of resources and relationships included in the file. In another example as code is applied to model if additionalHop is set to true an additional hop toward the core of the network may add switch and router and the relationships to switch and router as the second set of network devices written to the file.
