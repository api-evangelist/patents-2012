This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 479 480 filed on Apr. 27 2011 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a virtual recycling system which operates to advise and assist users in the acquisition of the most convenient and desirable recycling services. The system makes comprehensive information relevant to the recycling services as well as specified actual services themselves fully accessible to the user instantaneously and in a highly portable manner. This is accomplished by utilizing a computerized mobile interface device connected to an information network to gather user specific information and a method of analyzing and subsequently transforming said information into useful direction both graphical and non graphical in nature and of remotely initiating transactions involving the desired recycling services.

At present with respect to the recycling scrapyard industry it is common that contractors home remodelers and other professionals and non professionals working and or operating in various construction related capacities Contractors are tasked with disposing of waste materials produced as a result of the construction and or remodeling work thus commissioned. Because a Contractor s job site may be at any geographic location and may involve various types of materials which may or may not produce recyclable waste a common problem is created whereby the Contractor may be devoid of knowledge as to whether or not local recycling services can be had with respect to the specific materials being used the location of such recycling services and real time comparisons as to the financial benefits of local versus non local recycling services.

Currently aside from the present invention there exists no national or international system in the United States of America or elsewhere which both serves the purposes of aggregating the information relating to all recycling services available in a geographic location and analyzing information specific to individual Contractors for the purpose of automatically directing said Contractors to the most desirable recycling services. Furthermore because of the nature of the construction and remodeling related industries whereby Contractors perform a substantial amount of their work on the road or at the job site such a system which is not highly mobile would not provide a product that is a useful improvement to the trade. However as a result of recent advancements in cellular Smart Phone technology it has become possible to provide the results of highly complex computations and visual pictorial directions in addition to other valuable communications and transactions to Contractors virtually anywhere and at any time. Thus the present invention improves upon the current state of art by utilizing recent advances in micro computing software and graphical user interfaces to provide a new and useful product to Contractors which was not possible previously.

As noted above the conventional methodology by which Contractors obtain recycling services involves a low tech trial and error approach utilizing information received via print media and immobile personal computers connected to a wired internet service. Some Contractors may obtain recycling services from the first provider that such Contractors make contact with and continue to obtain recycling services from the same provider until the recycling services become inadequate. Some Contractors may make educated guesses on a case by case basis as to which recycling service provider will be most convenient to a given job site with little to no assurance that said recycling service provider can provide the desired services or the most favorable rates.

In light of the foregoing it is an object of the present invention to solve the problem of low tech trial and error recycling and scrap metal ing by introducing a high tech process that allows for Contractors to have instantaneous access to all of the knowledge necessary for the efficient disposal of recyclable waste materials.

In furtherance of providing a high tech solution to an age old problem in the construction and remodeling industries the present invention is designed such that once installed in a computerized mobile interface device such as a mobile or cellular smart telephone the present invention automatically accesses the computerized mobile interface device s Global Positioning Service or geographic locator GPS technology in order to facilitate a range of tools meant to provide both visual and text based direction to the user.
