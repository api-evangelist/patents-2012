This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 12 502 433 filed on 14 Jul. 2009 and also claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 080 944 filed on 15 Jul. 2008 which is incorporated by reference in entirety.

The present invention relates to conjugates of therapeutically useful anthracyclines with carriers such as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies proteins or peptides of natural or synthetic origin methods for their preparation pharmaceutical composition containing them and use thereof in treating certain mammalian tumors. The invention also relates to new anthracycline derivatives and to their preparation.

Anthracyclines are antibiotic compounds that exhibit cytotoxic activity. Studies have indicated that anthracyclines may operate to kill cells by a number of different mechanisms including 1 intercalation of the drug molecules into the DNA of the cell thereby inhibiting DNA dependent nucleic acid synthesis 2 production by the drug of free radicals which then react with cellular macromolecules to cause damage to the cells or 3 interactions of the drug molecules with the cell membrane see e.g. C. Peterson et al. Transport And Storage Of Anthracycline In Experimental Systems And Human Leukemia in N. R. Bachur Free Radical Damage id. at pp. 97 102 . Because of their cytotoxic potential anthracyclines have been used in the treatment of numerous cancers such as leukemia breast carcinoma lung carcinoma ovarian adenocarcinoma and sarcomas see e.g. P. H Wiernik in p 11 . Commonly used anthracyclines include doxorubicin epirubicin idarubicin and daunomycin.

In the recent years many new highly cytotoxic anthracyclines have been synthesized. For example nemorubicin the anthracycline derivative bearing a substituted morpholino ring linked to the C 3 position of the sugar moiety has shown promising antitumor activity on experimental murine tumors see J. W. Lown Bioactive Molecules 1988 vol 6 55 101 and is currently under clinical phase trials for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma see C. Sessa O. Valota C. Geroni Cardiovascular Toxicology 2007 7 2 75 79 . Although these compounds may be useful in the treatment of neoplasm and other disease states wherein a selected cell population is sought to be eliminated their therapeutic efficacy is often limited by the dose dependent toxicity associated with their administration.

Attempts to improve the therapeutic effect of these compounds have been tried by linking the anthracycline to antibodies or to different carriers. An example of an anthracycline conjugated with antibodies is reported for example in EP 0328147 to Bristol Myers in WO 9202255 to Farmitalia Carlo Erba or in U.S. Pat. No. 5 776 458 to Pharmacia Upjohn.

Other interesting tricyclic morpholino anthracycline derivatives characterized by high activity were described and claimed in the International patent application WO 98 02446 1997 of M. Caruso et al. Among these derivatives a particularly active compound is PNU 159682 described by Quintieri L. Geroni C. et al. in Clinical Cancer Research 2005 11 4 1608 1617. Compound PNU 159682 has the formula IIA as defined herein below and the following chemical names 

Antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer immunological and angiogenic disorders Carter P. 2006 Nature Reviews Immunology 6 343 357 . The use of antibody drug conjugates ADC i.e. immunoconjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer targets delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein whereas systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Xie et al 2006 Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 6 3 281 291 Kovtun et al 2006 Cancer Res. 66 6 3214 3121 Law et al 2006 Cancer Res. 66 4 2328 2337 Wu et al 2005 Nature Biotech. 23 9 1137 1145 Lambert J. 2005 Current Opin. in Pharmacol. 5 543 549 Hamann P. 2005 Expert Opin.

Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies mAbs as well as drug mechanism of action drug linking drug antibody ratio loading and drug releasing properties McDonagh 2006 Protein Eng. Design Sel. Doronina et al 2006 Bioconj. Chem. 17 114 124 Erickson et al 2006 Cancer Res. 66 8 1 8 Sanderson et al 2005 Clin. Cancer Res. 11 843 852 Jeffrey et al 2005 J. Med. Chem. 48 1344 1358 Hamblett et al 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10 7063 7070 . Drug moieties may impart their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

The anthracycline analog doxorubicin ADRIAMYCIN is thought to interact with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase II which unwinds DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin DAUNOMYCIN are prototype cytotoxic natural product anthracycline chemotherapeutics Sessa et al 2007 Cardiovasc. Toxicol. 7 75 79 . Immunoconjugates and prodrugs of daunorubicin and doxorubicin have been prepared and studied Kratz et al 2006 Current Med. Chem. 13 477 523 Jeffrey et al 2006 Bioorganic Med. Chem.

Chem. 45 4336 4343 U.S. Pat. No. 6 630 579 . The antibody drug conjugate BR96 doxorubicin reacts specifically with the tumor associated antigen Lewis Y and has been evaluated in phase I and II studies Saleh et al 2000 J. Clin.

While the invention will be described in conjunction with the enumerated embodiments it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover all alternatives modifications and equivalents which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described. Unless defined otherwise technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs and are consistent with Singleton et al. 1994 2. J. Wiley Sons New York N.Y. and Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5th Ed. Garland Publishing New York.

Unless stated otherwise the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the following meanings.

When trade names are used herein applicants intend to independently include the trade name product formulation the generic drug and the active pharmaceutical ingredient s of the trade name product.

 Anthracycline derivative is a nemorubicin metabolite or analog compound including but not limited to PNU 159682.

 Anthracycline derivative conjugate is a compound comprised of an anthracycline derivative covalently attached through a linker to a carrier moiety including antibodies proteins or peptides. Anthracycline derivative conjugate compounds include antibody drug conjugate ADC compounds.

The term amino acid side chain includes those groups found in i naturally occurring amino acids such as alanine arginine asparagine aspartic acid cysteine glutamine glutamic acid glycine histidine isoleucine leucine lysine methionine phenylalanine proline serine threonine tryptophan tyrosine and valine ii minor amino acids such as ornithine and citrulline iii unnatural amino acids beta amino acids synthetic analogs and derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids and iv all enantiomers diastereomers isomerically enriched isotopically labelled e.g. H 3H C N protected forms and racemic mixtures thereof.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies dimers multimers multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity Miller et al 2003 Jour. of Immunology 170 4854 4861 . Antibodies may be murine human humanized chimeric or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5th Ed. Garland Publishing New York . A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites also called epitopes recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full length immunoglobulin molecule i.e. a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof such targets including but not limited to cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD and IgA class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species including human murine or rabbit origin.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies fragments produced by a Fab expression library anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies CDR complementary determining region and epitope binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al 1975 256 495 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods see U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 Marks et al 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al 1984 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 6855 . Chimeric antibodies include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape and human constant region sequences.

An intact antibody herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains as well as a light chain constant domain CL and heavy chain constant domains CH1 CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more effector functions which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains intact antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

An ErbB receptor is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the ErbB receptor family which are important mediators of cell growth differentiation and survival. The ErbB receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR ErbB1 HER1 HER2 ErbB2 or p185 HER3 ErbB3 and HER4 ErbB4 or tyro2 . The ErbB receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain which may bind an ErbB ligand a lipophilic transmembrane domain a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a carboxyl terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The ErbB receptor may be a native sequence ErbB receptor or an amino acid sequence variant thereof. The ErbB receptor may be native sequence human ErbB receptor. Accordingly a member of the ErbB receptor family is EGFR ErbB1 ErbB2 ErbB3 ErbB4 or any other ErbB receptor currently known or to be identified in the future. Sequence identity screening has resulted in the identification of two other ErbB receptor family members ErbB3 U.S. Pat. No. 5 183 884 U.S. Pat. No. 5 480 968 Kraus et al 1989 PNAS USA 86 9193 9197 and ErbB4 EP 599274 Plowman et al 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 1746 1750 and Plowman et al 1993 Nature 366 473 475 . Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least some breast cancer cell lines. Anti ErbB2 antibodies have been characterized U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 U.S. Pat.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. rodent antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al 1986 Nature 321 522 525 Riechmann et al 1988 Nature 332 323 329 and Presta 1992 Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 . Humanized anti ErbB2 antibodies include huMAb4D5 1 huMAb4D5 2 huMAb4D5 3 huMAb4D5 4 huMAb4D5 5 huMAb4D5 6 huMAb4D5 7 and huMAb4D5 8 HERCEPTIN trastuzumab as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 expressly incorporated herein by reference humanized 520C9 WO 93 21319 and humanized 2C4 antibodies.

The terms treat and treatment refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen an undesired physiological change or disorder such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention beneficial or desired clinical results include but are not limited to alleviation of symptoms diminishment of extent of disease stabilized i.e. not worsening state of disease delay or slowing of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission whether partial or total whether detectable or undetectable. Treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.

A disorder is any condition that would benefit from treatment of the present invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include benign and malignant tumors leukemia and lymphoid malignancies in particular breast ovarian stomach endometrial salivary gland lung kidney colon thyroid pancreatic prostate or bladder cancer neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic and other glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal and blastocoelic disorders and inflammatory angiogenic and immunologic disorders. An exemplary disorder to be treated in accordance with the present invention is a solid malignant tumor.

The term therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may i reduce the number of cancer cells ii reduce the tumor size iii inhibit retard slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs iv inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis v inhibit tumor growth and or vi relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. In animal models efficacy may be assessed by physical measurements of the tumor during the course following administration of the ADC and by determining partial and complete remission of tumor. For cancer therapy efficacy can for example be measured by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR .

The term bioavailability refers to the systemic availability i.e. blood plasma levels of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time rate and total amount extent of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A tumor comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer NSCLC adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer gastrointestinal stromal tumor GIST pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma as well as head and neck cancer.

An ErbB expressing cancer is one comprising cells which have ErbB protein present at their cell surface. An ErbB2 expressing cancer is one which produces sufficient levels of ErbB2 at the surface of cells thereof such that an anti ErbB2 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer.

A cancer which overexpresses a receptor e.g. an ErbB receptor is one which has significantly higher levels of the receptor such as ErbB2 at the cell surface thereof compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. Receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the receptor protein present on the surface of a cell e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay IHC . Alternatively or additionally one may measure levels of receptor encoding nucleic acid in the cell e.g. via fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH see WO 98 45479 southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction PCR techniques such as real time quantitative PCR RT PCR . Overexpression of the receptor ligand may be determined diagnostically by evaluating levels of the ligand or nucleic acid encoding it in the patient e.g. in a tumor biopsy or by various diagnostic assays such as the IHC FISH southern blotting PCR or in vivo assays described above. One may also study receptor overexpression by measuring a shed antigen e.g. ErbB extracellular domain in a biological fluid such as serum see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 933 294 WO 91 05264 U.S. Pat. No. 5 401 638 and Sias et al 1990 J. Immunol. Methods 132 73 80 . Aside from the above assays various other in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes e.g. At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P C and radioactive isotopes of Lu chemotherapeutic agents and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including synthetic analogs and derivatives thereof.

A chemotherapeutic agent is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer regardless of mechanism of action. Classes of chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to alkyating agents antimetabolites spindle poison plant alkaloids cytoxic antitumor antibiotics topoisomerase inhibitors antibodies photosensitizers and kinase inhibitors.

 Linker or link means a divalent chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond or a chain of atoms that covalently attaches an antibody to a drug moiety. In various embodiments of formula I a linker is specified as L.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. 1994 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and 1 or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of an ADC. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate and pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counterion.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable solvate refers to an association of one or more solvent molecules and an ADC. Examples of solvents that form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine.

As stated before in a first aspect the present invention relates to conjugates of an anthracycline derivative of the formula I Ant L Z T I 

wherein Ant L and Z are as above defined and Q is a hydrogen atom a C Calkyl C Ccycloalkyl phenyl or benzyl group or a pharmaceutically salt thereof.

Preferably the anthracycline derivative residue that Ant represents can be released to give an anthracycline derivative of formula IIA 

In another preferred aspect the present invention provides an anthracycline derivative conjugate or a pharmaceutically salt thereof of the formula Ia 

wherein B is a C Calkylene moiety optionally hetero interrupted and v j k and y are independently 0 or 1.

It is clear that in this instance the anthracycline derivative residue which Ant represents is tether to the linker Lthrough an acetalic bond that involves the primary alcohol at the C 14 of the anthracycline skeleton.

As stated above an anthracycline derivative conjugate or a pharmaceutically salt thereof of the formula I releases the desired free anthracycline derivative as shown below for the preferred conjugates of the formula Ia 

c aminoalkylene thioalkylene aminocycloalkylene or thiocycloalkylene bearing a further thiol or amino group or a carboxylic residue 

d a peptidic residue able to tether the Llinker to the T carrier by forming new bonds as e.g. amide bonds disulfide bonds.

T is preferably selected from a polyclonal antibody or fragment thereof comprising an antigen binding site capable of binding to a tumor associated antigen a monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof comprising an antigen binding site capable of binding to an antigen preferentially or selectively expressed on tumor cell populations a peptide or protein capable optionally of preferentially or selectively binding to a tumor cell or a chemically modified derivative thereof suitable to be attached to the Ant L Z moiety or moieties or a polymeric carrier.

Particularly preferred compounds of formula Ia are those wherein the spacer group which Z represents is 

iii NH D NH CO wherein D is a C Calkylene C Ccycloalkylene or D NH is a peptide residue constituted from 1 to 4 amino acids having at least one free amino group that is Z T is derived from a carrier of formula T COOH wherein m is above defined 

iv NH D CO NH wherein D is as defined above or D CO is a peptide residue constituted from 1 to 4 amino acids having at least one free carboxylic group that is Z T is derived from a carrier of formula T NH wherein m is above defined 

v NH D N CH wherein D is as defined above and D N is as defined above for D NH that is Z T is derived from a carrier of formula T CHO wherein m is above defined

In this case the release of the desired free anthracycline derivative can be schematically illustrated as follows from the preferred conjugates of the formula Ib 

Another particularly preferred object of the present invention are the compounds of the formula I a and I b 

Also in this case the compounds of the formula I a and I b can be released in appropriate condition giving a compound of the formula II as defined above.

or a residue of formula VII or VIII as defined above characterized in that n is an integer from 2 to 5.

The linker L and spacer Z units attach the carrier e.g. antibody to the anthracycline derivative drug moiety D through covalent bond s . The linker is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more drug moiety D and an antibody unit Ab to form antibody drug conjugates ADC of formula Ic. The linker L may be stable outside a cell i.e. extracellular or it may be cleavable by enzymatic activity hydrolysis or other metabolic conditions. Antibody drug conjugates ADC can be conveniently prepared using a linker having reactive functionality for binding to the drug moiety and to the antibody. A cysteine thiol or an amine e.g. N terminus or amino acid side chain such as lysine of the antibody Ab can form a bond with a functional group of a linker or spacer reagent drug moiety D or drug linker reagent D L .

Many positions on anthracycline derivative compounds may be useful as the linkage position depending upon the type of linkage. For example ester amide thioamide thiocarbamate or carbamate linkages may be formed from the hydroxyl group of the hydroxymethyl ketone at C14 ketal and hydrazone linkages may be formed from the C13 carbonyl group on the drug moiety amide carbamate and urea linkages may be formed from an amino group on the drug moiety D and various alkyl ether thioether disulfide and acyl linkages may be formed from the phenyl and aryl rings on the drug moiety by Friedel Crafts type alkylation and acylation reactions.

The linkers and spacers are preferably stable extracellularly. Before transport or delivery into a cell the antibody drug conjugate ADC is preferably stable and remains intact i.e. the antibody remains linked to the drug moiety. The linkers are stable outside the target cell and may be cleaved at some efficacious rate inside the cell. An effective linker will i maintain the specific binding properties of the antibody ii allow intracellular delivery of the conjugate or drug moiety iii remain stable and intact i.e. not cleaved until the conjugate has been delivered or transported to its targetted site and iv maintain a cytotoxic cell killing effect or a cytostatic effect of the anthracycline derivative drug moiety. Stability of the ADC may be measured by standard analytical techniques such as mass spectroscopy HPLC and the separation analysis technique LC MS.

Covalent attachment of the antibody and the drug moiety requires the linker and optional spacer to have two reactive functional groups i.e. bivalency in a reactive sense. Bivalent linker reagents which are useful to attach two or more functional or biologically active moieties such as peptides nucleic acids drugs toxins antibodies haptens and reporter groups are known and methods have been described their resulting conjugates Hermanson G. T. 1996 Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press New York p 234 242 .

In another embodiment the linker or spacer may be substituted with groups which modulate solubility or reactivity. For example a sulfonate substituent may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab L with D or D L with Ab depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues . US 2007 0092940 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids.

In some embodiments a Linker has a reactive nucleophilic group which is reactive with an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include but are not limited to aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydroxyl hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.

Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

The Linker may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more than one drug moiety through a branching multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody US 2006 116422 US 2005 271615 de Groot et al 2003 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42 4490 4494 Amir et al 2003 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42 4494 4499 Shamis et al 2004 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126 1726 1731 Sun et al 2002 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12 2213 2215 Sun et al 2003 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 11 1761 1768 King et al 2002 Tetrahedron Letters 43 1987 1990 . Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody i.e. loading which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus where an antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic or branched linker.

The antibody unit Ab of Formula IIc includes any unit type or class of antibody that binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target cell population. An antibody can be any protein or protein like molecule that binds to complexes with or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. In one aspect the antibody unit acts to deliver the anthracycline derivative drug moiety to the particular target cell population with which the antibody unit reacts. Such antibodies include but are not limited to large molecular weight proteins such as full length antibodies and antibody fragments. The antibodies of Formula I allow attaining high concentrations of active metabolite molecules in cancer cells. Intracellular targeting may be achieved by methods and compounds which allow accumulation or retention of biologically active agents inside cells. Such effective targeting may be applicable to a variety of therapeutic formulations and procedures.

In one embodiment the ADC specifically binds to a receptor encoded by an ErbB gene such as EGFR HER2 HER3 and HER4. The ADC may specifically bind to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. The ADC may inhibit growth of tumor cells which overexpress HER2 receptor.

In another embodiment the antibody Ab of Formula IIc is a humanized antibody such as huMAb4D5 1 huMAb4D5 2 huMAb4D5 3 huMAb4D5 4 huMAb4D5 5 huMAb4D5 6 huMAb4D5 7 or huMAb4D5 8 trastuzumab .

The antibodies of the invention include cysteine engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of any form of wild type or parent antibody is replaced with a cysteine amino acid. The engineered cysteine amino acid is a free cysteine acid and not part of an intrachain or interchain disulfide unit. Any form type or variant of antibody may be so engineered i.e. mutated. For example a parent Fab antibody fragment may be engineered to form a cysteine engineered Fab referred to herein as ThioFab. Similarly a parent monoclonal antibody may be engineered to form a ThioMab. It should be noted that a single site mutation yields a single engineered cysteine residue in a ThioFab while a single site mutation yields two engineered cysteine residues in a ThioMab due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. The cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention include monoclonal antibodies humanized or chimeric monoclonal antibodies antigen binding fragments of antibodies fusion polypeptides and analogs that preferentially bind cell associated polypeptides.

Cysteine engineered antibodies have been designed as Fab antibody fragments thioFab and expressed as full length IgG monoclonal thioMab antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 the contents of which are incorporated by reference . ThioFab and ThioMab antibodies have been conjugated through linkers at the newly introduced cysteine thiols with thiol reactive linker reagents and drug linker reagents to prepare antibody drug conjugates Thio ADC including anti HER2 U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 anti CD22 US 2008 0050310 and anti steap1 WO 2008 052187 as well as other cysteine engineered antibodies and antibody drug conjugates.

Antibodies comprising the antibody drug conjugates of Formula IIc preferably retain the antigen binding capability of their native wild type counterparts. Thus antibodies of the invention are capable of binding preferably specifically to antigens. Such antigens include for example tumor associated antigens TAA cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules cell survival regulatory factors cell proliferation regulatory factors molecules associated with for e.g. known or suspected to contribute functionally to tissue development or differentiation lymphokines cytokines molecules involved in cell cycle regulation molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated with for e.g. known or suspected to contribute functionally to angiogenesis. The tumor associated antigen may be a cluster differentiation factor i.e. a CD protein . An antigen to which an antibody of the invention is capable of binding may be a member of a subset of one of the above mentioned categories wherein the other subset s of said category comprise other molecules antigens that have a distinct characteristic with respect to the antigen of interest .

In one embodiment the antibody of antibody drug conjugates ADC of Formula IIc specifically binds to a receptor encoded by an ErbB gene. The antibody may bind specifically to an ErbB receptor selected from EGFR HER2 HER3 and HER4. The ADC may specifically bind to the extracellular domain ECD of the HER2 receptor and inhibit the growth of tumor cells which overexpress HER2 receptor. The antibody of the ADC may be a monoclonal antibody e.g. a murine monoclonal antibody a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody. A humanized antibody may be huMAb4D5 1 huMAb4D5 2 huMAb4D5 3 huMAb4D5 4 huMAb4D5 5 huMAb4D5 6 huMAb4D5 7 or huMAb4D5 8 trastuzumab . The antibody may be an antibody fragment e.g. a Fab fragment.

Antibodies in Formula IIc antibody drug conjugates ADC and which may be useful in the treatment of cancer include but are not limited to antibodies against cell surface receptors and tumor associated antigens TAA . Such tumor associated antigens are known in the art and can be prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type s of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non cancerous cell s . Often such tumor associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody based therapies.

Examples of TAA include but are not limited to the Tumor Associated Antigens 1 36 listed below. For convenience information relating to these antigens all of which are known in the art is listed below and includes names alternative names Genbank accession numbers and primary reference s following nucleic acid and protein sequence identification conventions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI . Nucleic acid and protein sequences corresponding to TAA 1 36 are available in public databases such as GenBank. Tumor associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms possessing at least about 70 80 85 90 or 95 sequence identity relative to the sequences identified in the cited references or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example a TAA having a variant sequence generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure in the reference specifically recited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.

It is well known that in malignant tumors there is a high rate of glycolysis compared to normal tissue causing an increase in the production of lactate and thus a decrease of the pH in the tumor see H. M. Rauen et al. Z. Naturforsch Teil B 23 1968 1461. The invention affords a two level specificity of action of the compounds the first one consisting in a preferential localization of the conjugate in the tumor tissue by means of antigenic recognition and the second one consisting in a preferential release of the drug in its active form in the tumor tissue by means of preferential acidic cleavage. While not limiting the scope or utility of the compositions or methods of the invention the acid sensitive acetal linkers described herein may be cleaved in vivo under localized or systemic acidic conditions thus separating the targeting antibody from the drug moiety.

The conjugates produced according to the methods described are characterized following different chemical physical methods. The retention of the original molecular weight and the lack of aggregate formation may be assessed by chromatographic gel filtration procedures Yu D. S. et al. J. Urol. 140 415 1988 with simultaneous and independent detection of anthracycline and antibody at different wavelengths and by gel electrophoretic methods. The overall charge distribution of the compounds obtained may be assessed by chromatographic ion exchange methods. The anthracycline concentration may be assessed by spectrophotometric titration against a standard calibration curve obtained from the parent anthracycline. The protein concentration may be assessed by colorimetric assays such as the bicinchonic acid assay Smith P. K. et al. Anal. Biochem. 150 76 1985 or the Bradford dye assay Bradford M. M. 1976 Anal. Biochem. 72 248 . The antigen binding activity retention of the antibodies after the conjugation procedures may be assessed by an ELISA method Yu D. S. et al. J. Urol. 140 415 1988 and by cytofluorimetric methods Gallego J. et al. Int. J. Cancer 33 737 1984 . The acid sensitivity of the conjugate may be evaluated by chromatographic methods after incubation of the compounds in suitable buffered solutions.

The drug loading is represented by p in an antibody drug conjugate molecule of Formula I the average number of anthracycline derivative drugs per antibody. Drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs D per antibody Ab i.e. where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the antibody. Compositions of ADC of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs from 1 to 8. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy ELISA assay electrophoresis and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined Hamblett et al 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10 7063 7070 Sanderson et al 2005 Clin. Cancer Res. 11 843 852 . However the distribution of p drug values is not discernible by the antibody antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also ELISA assay for detection of antibody drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.

For some antibody drug conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading e.g. p 5 may cause aggregation insolubility toxicity or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates.

Typically fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example many lysine residues that do not react with the drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine reactive linker reagent. Also only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol reactive linker reagent. Generally antibodies do not contain many if any free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT or TCEP under partial or total reducing conditions. Additionally the antibody must be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading drug antibody ratio of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners including i limiting the molar excess of drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature and iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.

Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 . The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol reactive electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha halo amides to form ADC with cysteine engineered antibodies and the anthracycline derivative drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed controlled and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol reactive linker reagents or drug linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved and near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC.

Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody e.g. 1 2 3 etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase PLRP and hydrophobic interaction HIC may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value p may be isolated however these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached via the linker at different sites on the antibody.

Thus the antibody drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more anthracycline derivative drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.

The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form antibody linker intermediate Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety reagent and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a drug moiety reagent with a linker reagent to form drug linker reagent D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody. Conjugation methods 1 and 2 may be employed with a variety of antibodies drug moieties and linkers to prepare the antibody drug conjugates of Formula I.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT Cleland s reagent dithiothreitol or TCEP tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride Getz et al 1999 Anal. Biochem. Vol 273 73 80 Soltec Ventures Beverly Mass. . Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.

Antibody drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson G. T. 1996 Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press New York p 234 242 . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Reactive nucleophilic groups may be introduced on the anthracycline derivative compounds by standard functional group interconversions. For example hydroxyl groups may be converted to thiol groups by Mitsunobu type reactions to form thiol modified drug compounds.

The antibody drug conjugates in Table 2 were prepared according to the described methods in the Examples and tested for efficacy by in vitro cell proliferation assay and in vivo tumor xenograft growth inhibition.

Assay methods for detecting cancer cells comprise exposing cells to an antibody drug conjugate compound and determining the extent of binding of the antibody drug conjugate compound to the cells. Formula I ADC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell based assays can be further tested in tumor bearing higher primates and human clinical trials.

Transgenic animals and cell lines are particularly useful in screening antibody drug conjugates ADC that have potential as prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders involving overexpression of tumor associated antigens and cell surface receptors e.g. HER2 U.S. Pat. No. 6 632 979 . Screening for a useful ADC may involve administering candidate ADC over a range of doses to the transgenic animal and assaying at various time points for the effect s of the ADC on the disease or disorder being evaluated. Alternatively or additionally the drug can be administered prior to or simultaneously with exposure to an inducer of the disease if applicable. Candidate ADC may be screened serially and individually or in parallel under medium or high throughput screening format. The rate at which ADC may be screened for utility for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments of diseases or disorders is limited only by the rate of synthesis or screening methodology including detecting measuring analysis of data.

One embodiment is a screening method comprising a transplanting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line into a non human animal b administering an ADC drug candidate to the non human animal and c determining the ability of the candidate to inhibit the formation of tumors from the transplanted cell line. The invention also concerns a method of screening ADC candidates for the treatment of a disease or disorder characterized by the overexpression of a receptor protein comprising a contacting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line with a drug candidate and b evaluating the ability of the ADC candidate to inhibit the growth of the stable cell line.

One embodiment is a screening method comprising a contacting cells from a stable breast cancer cell line with an ADC drug candidate and b evaluating the ability of the ADC candidate to induce cell death induce apoptosis block heregulin binding block ligand stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation or block ligand activation of HER2. Another embodiment the ability of the ADC candidate to is evaluated. In another embodiment the ability of the ADC candidate to is evaluated.

Another embodiment is a screening method comprising a administering an ADC drug candidate to a transgenic non human mammal that overexpresses e.g. in its mammary gland cells a native human protein e.g. HER2 or a fragment thereof wherein such transgenic mammal has stably integrated into its genome a nucleic acid sequence encoding the native human protein or a fragment thereof having the biological activity of the native human protein operably linked to transcriptional regulatory sequences directing its expression and develops a tumor. Candidate ADC are screened by being administered to the transgenic animal over a range of doses and evaluating the animal s physiological response to the compounds over time. Administration may be oral or by suitable injection depending on the chemical nature of the compound being evaluated. In some cases it may be appropriate to administer the compound in conjunction with co factors that would enhance the efficacy of the compound. If cell lines derived from the subject transgenic animals are used to screen for compounds useful in treating various disorders associated with overexpression of certain tumor associated antigen proteins or cell surface receptors e.g. HER2 overexpression. To identify growth inhibitory ADC compounds that specifically target HER2 one may screen for ADC which inhibit the growth of HER2 overexpressing cancer cells derived from transgenic animals U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 

Generally the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody drug conjugate ADC is measured by exposing mammalian cells having tumor associated antigens or receptor proteins to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days and measuring cell viability. Cell based in vitro assays may be used to measure viability i.e. proliferation IC cytotoxicity EC and induction of apoptosis caspase activation of the ADC. The CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available Promega Corp. Madison Wis. homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 5 583 024 U.S. Pat. No. 5 674 713 U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 670 . This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells Crouch et al 1993 J. Immunol. Meth. 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677 . The CellTiter Glo Assay is conducted in 96 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS Cree et al 1995 AntiCancer Drugs 6 398 404 . The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cells cultured in serum supplemented medium. Cell washing removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells well in a well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.

The evaluation of the retention of cytotoxicity of conjugates in comparison with the parent drug may be assessed by a test based on the quantification of ATP. A2780 human ovarian and MCF7 human breast cancer cells 1250 cells well were seeded in white 384 well plates in complete medium RPMI1640 or EMEM plus 10 Fetal bovine serum and treated with compounds dissolved in 0.1 DMSO 24 h after seeding. The cells were incubated at 37 C. and 5 CO2 and after 72 hours the plates were processed using CellTiter Glo assay Promega following the manufacturer s instruction.

CellTiter Glo is a homogenous method based on the quantification of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells. ATP is quantified using a system based on luciferase and D luciferin resulting into light generation. The luminescent signal is proportional to the number of cells present in culture. Briefly 25 L well reagent solutions were added to each well and after 5 minutes shacking microplates were read by a luminometer. The luminescent signal is proportional to the number of cells present in culture.

The anti proliferative effects of antibody drug conjugates of Formula Ic Table 6 were measured by the CellTiter Glo Assay Example 9 against the HER2 expressing tumor cell lines in in 3 day continuous exposure studies.

Table 3 summarizes the ICvalues ug ml for inhibition of SK BR 3 BT 474 MCF7 doxorubicin resistant DoxRes and doxorubicin resistant DoxRes with verapamil cell proliferation of the test compounds of . Comparing SK BR 3 and BT 474 to MCF7 the maleimide ketal Ant and NHS ketal Ant ADC show target dependent killing whereas hydrazone linked Ant ADC show target independent non selective killing.

The anti proliferative effects of antibody drug conjugates of Formula Ic Table 6 were measured by the CellTiter Glo Assay Example 9 against CD22 positive B lymphoma cell lines BJAB GRANTA DoHH2 and SuDHL4 in 3 day continuous exposure studies. Jurkat cells CD22 negative were treated with the antibody drug conjugates as a negative control.

Table 4 summarizes the ICvalues ug ml for inhibition of BJAB GRANTA DoHH2 SuDHL4 and Jurkat cell lines by test antibody drug conjugate compounds in 3 day continuous exposure studies. The anti CD22 antibody drug conjugates 107 110 showed highly potent cell killing effects. Significant cell killing was observed with negative control anti HER2 antibody drug conjugates 102 105. Significant cell killing was observed with anti CD22 antibody drug conjugates 107 110 on CD22 negative Jurkat cells.

Serum clearance and stability of ADC may be investigated in nude naive without tumors received by exogenous grafts mice according to the procedures in Example 10. A difference in the amount of total antibody and ADC indicates cleavage of the linker and separation of the antibody from its drug moiety.

Stability of the conjugates was studied using HPLC analysis. The conjugate was incubated in ammonium acetate buffers at pH 4 and 5.2 at 37 C. Each solution was then taken periodically and applied to an HPLC column using a method reported above. The amount of material released from the conjugate was determined and expressed as percent of released material.

The therapeutic effect of the antibody drug conjugate ADC compounds and the improvement of their therapeutic efficacy in comparison with the parent drug were assessed in animal models of human transplanted tumors. Mice bearing xenografts of human tumors were treated with suitable doses of antibody drug conjugates of PNU 159682 free drug and naked antibody at certain doses and the tumor growth was recorded and compared in the different treatment groups. show the efficacy of the antibody drug conjugates of Formula Ic by xenograft tumor inhibition in mice.

The efficacy of the antibody drug conjugates of the invention may be measured in vivo by implanting allografts or xenografts of cancer cells or primary tumors in rodents and treating the tumors with ADC according to the procedures of Example 12. Variable results are to be expected depending on the cell line the specificity of antibody binding of the ADC to receptors present on the cancer cells dosing regimen and other factors. For example the in vivo efficacy of anti HER2 ADC may be measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft may be propagated from the Fo5 mmtv transgenic mouse which does not respond to or responds poorly to HERCEPTIN therapy. Subjects are treated once with ADC and monitored over 3 6 weeks to measure the time to tumor doubling log cell kill and tumor shrinkage. Follow up dose response and multi dose experiments may be further conducted.

Table 5 shows the drug exposure level average drug loading tumor incidence and responses for each test compound treated group of in the 48 day in vivo Bjab luc xenograft tumor efficacy study. The Bjab luc EBV negative Burkitt s lymphoma luciferase expressing Bjab cells tumors express CD22 receptor protein Polson et al 2009 Cancer Res. 69 6 2358 2364 US 2008 0050310 US 2005 0276812 . CD22 is expressed only in the B cell compartment and on the surface of most NHL cells D Arena et al 2000 Am J Hematol. 64 275 81 Olejniczak et al 2006 Immunol Invest. 35 93 114 . Efficacy in inhibiting the Bjab luc xenograft tumor in mice as a model system may predict the clinical response in treating patients with hematopoietic malignancies such as non Hodgkins lymphoma. All of the anti CD22 ADC 107 108 111 were effective in tumor inhibition as compared with Vehicle and control ADC 102 and 103 that did not bind the Bjab luc cells. The absence of activity with control ADC indicates that the activity seen with the targeted ADC is specific for example it is not due to systemic release of free drug. In several cases tumors were not only inhibited but also partially and completely regressed by anti CD22 conjugates 107 108 111 . These data indicate that anti CD22 surface antigen is a potentially effective target for the anthracycline derivative ADC of the invention.

Table 6 shows the tumor growth inhibition at day 7 drug exposure level average drug loading tumor incidence and responses for each test compound treated group of in the 38 day in vivo MMTV HER2Fo5 mammary allograft tumor efficacy study Phillips et al 2008 Cancer Res. 68 22 9280 9290 US 2005 0276812 . The MMTV HER2 Fo5 mammary allograft tumor is a trastuzumab insensitive HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell line. The targeted anti HER2 ADC 101 102 and combination of 101 and 102 were effective in tumor inhibition as compared with Vehicle and control ADC 107 that did not bind the MMTV HER2 Fo5 cells. The absence of activity with control ADC indicates that the activity seen with the targeted ADC is specific for example it is not due to systemic release of free drug. Tumors were not only inhibited but also partially and completely regressed by anti HER2 conjugates 101 102 and combination of 101 and 102 . Combination trastuzumab MCC DM1 101 and thio trastuzumab HC A114C maleimide ketal Ant 102 showed no additional response beyond that of single agent 102. These data indicate that anti HER2 surface antigen is a potentially effective target for the anthracycline derivative ADC of the invention.

Table 7 shows the drug exposure level average drug loading tumor incidence and responses for each test compound treated group of in the 49 day in vivo LnCap Ner xenograft tumor efficacy study. Steap1 six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate is a prostate specific cell surface antigen highly expressed in human prostate tumors Hubert et al 1999 PNAS 96 25 14523 14528 . The LnCap cell line highly expresses steap1. The LnCap Ner xenograft Jin et al 2004 Cancer Res. 64 5489 5495 tumor inhibition study in mice may be an effective predictor for treatment of prostate cancer in patients. The targeted anti steap1 ADC 112 and 113 were effective in tumor inhibition as compared with Vehicle and control ADC 107 that did not bind the LnCap cells. The absence of activity with control ADC indicates that the activity seen with the targeted ADC is specific for example it is not due to systemic release of free drug. Tumors were not only inhibited but also partially regressed by anti HER2 conjugates 112 and 113 . These data indicate that anti steap1 surface antigen is a potentially effective target for the anthracycline derivative ADC of the invention.

Antibody drug conjugates and an ADC minus control Vehicle may be evaluated in an acute toxicity rat model Brown et al 2002 Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 50 333 340 and according to Example 11. Toxicity of ADC is investigated by treatment of female Sprague Dawley rats with the ADC and subsequent inspection and analysis of the effects on various organs. Based on gross observations body weights clinical pathology parameters serum chemistry and hematology and histopathology the toxicity of ADC may be observed characterized and measured.

A multi day acute toxicity study in adolescent female rats may be conducted by one or more doses of a candidate ADC a control ADC free anthracycline derivative compound PNU 159682 and a control Vehicle day 0 . Body weight is measured periodically. Clinical chemistry serum enzymes and hematology analysis is also conducted periodically concluding with complete necropsy with histopathological assessment. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss considering that weight loss or weight change relative to animals dosed only with Vehicle in animals after dosing with ADC is a gross and general indicator of systemic or localized toxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be measured by i elevated liver enzymes such as AST aspartate aminotransferase ALT alanine aminotransferase GGT g glutamyl transferase ii increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures and iii hepatocyte necrosis. Hematolymphoid toxicity is observed by depletion of leukocytes primarily granuloctyes neutrophils and or platelets and lymphoid organ involvement i.e. atrophy or apoptotic activity. Toxicity is also noted by gastrointestinal tract lesions such as increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures and degenerative entercolitis.

Therapeutic antibody drug conjugates ADC may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally i.e. infusion subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intradermal intrathecal bolus intratumor injection or epidural Shire et al 2004 J. Pharm. Sciences 93 6 1390 1402 . Pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic antibody drug conjugates ADC are typically prepared for parenteral administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An antibody drug conjugate ADC having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents carriers excipients or stabilizers in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 1980 16th edition Osol A. Ed. .

The ADC may be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Any appropriate carrier or diluent may be used. Suitable carriers and diluents include physiological saline solution and Ringers dextrose solutions.

Acceptable parenteral vehicles diluents carriers excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include i buffers such as phosphate citrate dibasic calcium phosphate magnesium stearate and other organic acids ii antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine iii preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol iv alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol v low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins vi hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone vii amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine viii monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose lactose sucrose mannitol trehalose sodium starch glycolate sorbitol mannose carboxymethylcellulose or dextrins ix chelating agents such as EDTA x salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes xi non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG xii glidants or granulating agents such as magnesium stearate carboxymethylcellulose talc silica and hydrogenated vegetable oil xiii disintegrant such as crosprovidone sodium starch glycolate or cornstarch xiv thickening agents such as gelatin and polyethylene glycol xv enteric coatings such as triethyl citrate and or xvi taste or texture modifiers antifoaming agents pigments and dessicants. For example lyophilized anti ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97 04801 expressly incorporated herein by reference. An exemplary formulation of an ADC contains about 100 mg ml of trehalose 2 hydroxymethyl 6 3 4 5 trihydroxy 6 hydroxymethyl tetrahydropyran 2 yl oxy tetrahydropyran 3 4 5 triol CHO CAS Number 99 20 7 and about 0.1 TWEEN 20 polysorbate 20 dodecanoic acid 2 2 3 4 bis 2 hydroxyethoxy tetrahydrofuran 2 yl 2 2 hydroxyethoxy ethoxy ethyl ester CHO CAS Number 9005 64 5 at approximately pH 6.

Pharmaceutical formulations of a therapeutic antibody drug conjugate ADC may contain certain amounts of unreacted drug moiety D antibody linker intermediate Ab L and or drug linker intermediate D L as a consequence of incomplete purification and separation of excess reagents impurities and by products in the process of making the ADC or time temperature hydrolysis or degradation upon storage of the bulk ADC or formulated ADC composition. For example a formulation of the ADC may contain a detectable amount of free drug. Alternatively or in addition to it may contain a detectable amount of drug linker intermediate. Alternatively or in addition to it may contain a detectable amount of the antibody. The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacrylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the ADC which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and gamma ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid.

Formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. . Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared under sterile conditions and by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the ADC with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials ADC in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose croscarmellose povidone methylcellulose hydroxypropyl methylcelluose sodium alginate polyvinylpyrrolidone gum tragacanth and gum acacia and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide e.g. lecithin a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid e.g. polyoxyethylene stearate a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol e.g. heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate . The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n propyl p hydroxy benzoate one or more coloring agents one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin.

The pharmaceutical compositions of ADC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1 3 butane diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.

The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 g of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL hr can occur. Subcutaneous bolus administration may be effected with about 1.5 ml or less of total volume and a concentration of about 100 mg ADC per ml. For ADC that require frequent and chronic administration the subcutaneous route may be employed such as by pre filled syringe or autoinjector device technology.

As a general proposition the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of ADC administered per dose will be in the range of about 0.01 100 mg kg namely about 0.1 to 20 mg kg of patient body weight per day with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg kg day. For example human patients may be initially dosed at about 1.5 mg ADC per kg patient body weight. The dose may be escalated to the maximally tolerated dose MTD . The dosing schedule may be about every 3 weeks but according to diagnosed condition or response the schedule may be more or less frequent. The dose may be further adjusted during the course of treatment to be at or below MTD which can be safely administered for multiple cycles such as about 4 or more.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants buffers bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.

Although oral administration of protein therapeutics are generally disfavored due to poor bioavailability due to limited absorption hydrolysis or denaturation in the gut formulations of ADC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the ADC.

The formulations may be packaged in unit dose or multi dose containers for example sealed ampoules and vials and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier for example water for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Exemplary unit dosage formulations contain a daily dose or unit daily sub dose or an appropriate fraction thereof of the active ingredient.

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention are useful as antitumor agents. A mammal e.g. a human or animal may therefore be treated by a method comprising administering thereto a pharmaceutically effective amount of a conjugate of formula I as hereinbefore defined. The condition of the human or animal may be ameliorated or improved in this way.

Formula I ADC may be used to treat various diseases or disorders in a patient such as cancer and autoimmune conditions including those characterized by the overexpression of a tumor associated antigen. Exemplary conditions or disorders include benign or malignant tumors leukemia and lymphoid malignancies other disorders such as neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal blastocoelic inflammatory angiogenic and immunologic disorders. Cancer types susceptible to ADC treatment include those which are characterized by the overexpression of certain tumor associated antigens or cell surface receptors e.g. HER2.

One method is for the treatment of cancer in a mammal wherein the cancer is characterized by the overexpression of an ErbB receptor. The mammal optionally does not respond or responds poorly to treatment with an unconjugated anti ErbB antibody. The method comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody drug conjugate compound. The growth of tumor cells that overexpress a growth factor receptor such as HER2 receptor or EGF receptor may be inhibited by administering to a patient a Formula I ADC which binds specifically to said growth factor receptor and a chemotherapeutic agent wherein said antibody drug conjugate and said chemotherapeutic agent are each administered in amounts effective to inhibit growth of tumor cells in the patient.

A human patient susceptible to or diagnosed with a disorder characterized by overexpression of ErbB2 receptor may be treated by administering a combination of a Formula I ADC and a chemotherapeutic agent. Such excessive activation may be attributable to overexpression or increased production of the ErbB receptor or an ErbB ligand. In one embodiment a diagnostic or prognostic assay will be performed to determine whether the patient s cancer is characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor. For example ErbB gene amplification and or overexpression of an ErbB receptor in the cancer may be determined. Various assays for determining such amplification overexpression are available in the art and include IHC FISH and shed antigen assays.

Examples of cancer to be treated herein include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer gastrointestinal stromal tumor GIST pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma as well as head and neck cancer.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The ADC formulation is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 20 mg kg of ADC is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical dosage regimen might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful.

An antibody drug conjugate ADC may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with a second compound having anti cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.

The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxic agent cytokine growth inhibitory agent anti hormonal agent aromatase inhibitor protein kinase inhibitor lipid kinase inhibitor anti androgen antisense oligonucleotide ribozyme gene therapy vaccine anti angiogenic agent and or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin forming inhibitor a topoisomerase inhibitor or a DNA binder.

Alternatively or additionally the second compound may be an antibody which binds or blocks ligand activation of tumor associated antigen or receptor. The second antibody may be conjugated with a cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic agent e.g. a macrocyclic depsipeptide an auristatin a calicheamicin or a 1 8 bis naphthalimide moiety. For example it may be desirable to further provide antibodies which bind to EGFR ErbB2 ErbB3 ErbB4 or vascular endothelial factor VEGF in the one formulation or dosing regimen.

The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

In one embodiment treatment with an ADC of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers s instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1992 .

The ADC may be combined with an anti hormonal compound e.g. an anti estrogen compound such as tamoxifen an anti progesterone such as onapristone EP 616812 or an anti androgen such as flutamide in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer the patient may previously have been subjected to anti hormonal therapy and after the cancer becomes hormone independent the anti ErbB2 antibody and optionally other agents as described herein may be administered to the patient. It may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and or radiation therapy.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC compounds described herein to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation esterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound. Accordingly the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.

Metabolite products may be identified by preparing a radiolabelled e.g. C or H ADC administering it parenterally in a detectable dose e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg kg to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to man allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite . The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion e.g. by MS LC MS or NMR analysis. In general analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds.

Metabolites include the products of in vivo cleavage of the ADC where cleavage of any bond occurs that links the drug moiety to the antibody. Metabolic cleavage may thus result in the naked antibody or an antibody fragment. The antibody metabolite may be linked to a part or all of the linker. Metabolic cleavage may also result in the production a drug moiety or part thereof. The drug moiety metabolite may be linked to a part or all of the linker.

In another embodiment an article of manufacture or kit containing ADC and materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include for example bottles vials syringes or blister pack. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds an antibody drug conjugate ADC composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle . At least one active agent in the composition is an ADC. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice such as cancer.

In one embodiment the article of manufacture may further comprise a second or third container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer such as bacteriostatic water for injection BWFI phosphate buffered saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution and a package insert indicating that the first and second compounds can be used to treat cancer. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint including other buffers diluents filters needles and syringes.

The in vitro potency of antibody drug conjugates was measured by a cell proliferation assay . The CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available Promega Corp. Madison Wis. homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 5 583 024 U.S. Pat. No. 5 674 713 U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 670 . This assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells Crouch et al 1993 J. Immunol. Meth. 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677 . The CellTiter Glo Assay was conducted in 96 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS Cree et al 1995 AntiCancer Drugs 6 398 404 . The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cells cultured in serum supplemented medium.

The homogeneous add mix measure format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The substrate Beetle Luciferin is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units RLU . Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as RLU measured over time. Alternatively photons from luminescence can be counted in a scintillation counter in the presence of a scintillant. The light units can be represented then as CPS counts per second.

The disposition of antibody drug conjugates in vivo is analyzed by measuring the serum concentrations of antibody and of drug conjugate after a single intravenous bolus dose into Sprague Dawley rats. Concentrations of antibody drug conjugates bearing at least one cytotoxic drug are measured with an ELISA that used a extracellular domain ECD protein for the capture and anti anthracycline and horseradish peroxidase HRP conjugated anti mouse Fc antibody for detection. Total antibody concentrations in serum were measured with an ELISA that uses ECD for capture and anti human Fc HRP for detection measuring antibody both with and without conjugated anthracycline derivative. The serum concentration time data from each animal is analyzed using a two compartment model with IV bolus input first order elimination and macro rate constants Model 8 WinNonlin Pro v.5.0.1 Pharsight Corporation Mountain View Calif. .

A 12 day acute toxicity study in adolescent female rats 100 125 gms is conducted by a single injection of antibody drug conjugate at about 1 10 mg kg and a control Vehicle at day 1. Injection of test article is typically administered as an intravenous bolus. Body weight is measured daily. Clinical chemistry serum enzymes and hematology analysis is conducted periodically. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss.

All animal studies were performed in compliance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Genentech.

Efficacy studies were performed using SCID mice Charles River Laboratories . The efficacy models for the studies exemplified in were employed as described Polson et al 2009 Cancer Res. 69 6 2358 2364 Phillips et al 2008 Cancer Res. 68 22 9280 9290 US 2008 0050310 US 2005 0276812 evaluating tumor volume after a single intravenous dose. Transplant models were developed using tumors excised from a mouse bearing an intraperitoneal tumor then serially passaged into recipient mice. For example cells for implantation were washed and suspended in HBSS Hyclone and inoculated subcutaneously into the flanks of female CB17 ICR severe combined immunodeficiency mice 7 16 weeks of age from Charles Rivers Laboratories in a volume of 0.2 mL mouse. To test the efficacy of the antibody drug conjugates in vivo approximately several million cells per SCID mouse were inoculated once and allowed to grow for about 10 to 60 days post injection. When tumor volumes reached 150 200 mm typically Day 14 to Day 21 after inoculation the mice were segregated into sample groups of 9 10 mice per group and the tumor volume was determined in each mouse. When mean tumor size reached the desired volume the mice were divided into groups of 8 to 10 mice with the same mean tumor size and dosed intravenously via the tail vein with samples ADCs antibodies or Vehicle. ADC doses were either measured as the mass of the conjugated cytotoxic small molecule drug per surface area of the mouse or as a constant mass of ADC per mass of the mouse e.g. 5 mg of ADC kg mouse . In general the drug loads on the antibodies in any given experiment were similar or normalized so these two measures could be considered equivalent. Tumor volume was measured using calipers according to the formula V mm 0.5A B where A and B are the long and short diameters respectively. Mice were euthanized before tumor volume reached 3000 mmor when tumors showed signs of impending ulceration. Data collected from each experimental group were expressed as mean SE.
