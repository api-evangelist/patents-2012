This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 483 295 filed on May 6 2011 the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

Cloud computing refers to provision of computational resources via a computer network. In a traditional model of computing both data and software are fully contained on a user s computer. In cloud computing however the user s computer may contain relatively little software or data perhaps a minimal operating system and web browser for example and may serve as a display terminal for processes occurring on a network of computers. A common shorthand provided for a cloud computing service or system or even an aggregation of existing cloud services is the cloud. 

Cloud computing has been referred to as client server computing however there may be distinctions between general cloud computing and client server computing. For example client server computing may include a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between providers of a resource or service e.g. servers and service requesters e.g. clients . Client server computing generally involves a one to one relationship between the server and the client whereas cloud computing includes generic services that can be accessed by generic clients e.g. a one to one relationship or connection may not be required . Thus cloud computing generally includes client server computing and additional services and functionality.

Cloud computing may free users from certain hardware and software installation and maintenance tasks through use of simpler hardware on the user s computer that accesses a vast network of computing resources e.g. processors hard drives etc. . Sharing of resources may reduce cost to individuals. Thus any computer connected to the cloud may be connected to the same pool of computing power applications and files. Users can store and access personal files such as music pictures videos and bookmarks or play games or use productivity applications on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium such as a DVD or thumb drive.

In one example a user may open a browser and connect to a host of web servers that run user interface software that collect commands from the user and interpret the commands into commands on the servers. The servers may handle the computing and can either store or retrieve information from database servers or file servers and display an updated page to the user. Through cloud computing data across multiple servers can be synchronized around the world allowing for collaborative work on one file or project from multiple users around the world for example.

In one example a method is provided comprising receiving at a robotic device that includes at least one sensory device a short form command comprising at least an action descriptor and a target for the action descriptor. The method also includes determining a plurality of functions corresponding to the action descriptor and determining a plurality of targets in an environment of the robotic device that at least relate to the target. The method further includes determining from the plurality of functions a given function to perform based on the plurality of targets in the environment relating to the target and on the environment of the robotic device.

In another example a computer readable medium having stored therein instructions executable by a robotic device that includes at least one sensory device to cause the robotic device to perform functions is provided. The functions comprise receiving a short form command comprising at least an action descriptor and a target for the action descriptor and determining a plurality of functions corresponding to the action descriptor. The functions also comprise determining a plurality of targets in an environment of the robotic device that at least relate to the target and determining from the plurality of functions a given function to perform based on the plurality of targets in the environment relating to the target and on the environment of the robotic device.

In another example a robotic device is provided that comprises one or more processors at least one sensor coupled to the one or more processors and configured to capture data about an environment in a vicinity of the at least one sensor and memory including instructions stored thereon executable by the one or more processors to perform functions. The functions comprise receiving a short form command comprising at least an action descriptor and a target for the action descriptor determining a plurality of functions corresponding to the action descriptor and determining a plurality of targets in the environment of the robotic device that at least relate to the target. The functions also comprise determining from the plurality of functions a given function to perform based on the plurality of targets in the environment relating to the target and on the environment of the robotic device.

Any of the systems and methods described herein may be provided in a form of instructions stored on a non transitory computer readable medium that when executed by a computing device cause the computing device to perform functions of the method. Further examples may also include articles of manufacture including tangible computer readable media that have computer readable instructions encoded thereon and the instructions may comprise instructions to perform functions of the methods described herein.

The computer readable medium may include non transitory computer readable medium for example such as computer readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory processor cache and Random Access Memory RAM . The computer readable medium may also include non transitory media such as secondary or persistent long term storage like read only memory ROM optical or magnetic disks compact disc read only memory CD ROM for example. The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium for example or a tangible storage medium.

In addition circuitry may be provided that is wired to perform logical functions in any processes or methods described herein.

In still further examples any type of devices may be used or configured to perform logical functions in any processes or methods described herein.

In yet further examples any type of devices may be used or configured as means for performing functions of any of the methods described herein or any portions of the methods described herein .

The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. In addition to the illustrative aspects embodiments and features described above further aspects embodiments and features will become apparent by reference to the Figures and the following Detailed Description.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying Figures which form a part hereof. In the Figures similar symbols typically identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description figures and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure as generally described herein and illustrated in the Figures can be arranged substituted combined separated and designed in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.

This disclosure includes inter alia methods and systems for robot and user interaction over the cloud. Within examples cloud based computing generally refers to networked computer architectures in which application execution and storage may be divided to some extent between client and server devices. A robot may be any device that has a computing ability and interacts with its surroundings with an actuation capability e.g. electromechanical capabilities . A client device may be configured as a robot including various sensors and devices in the forms of modules and different modules may be added or removed from robot depending on requirements. In some examples a robot may be configured to receive a second device such as mobile phone that may be configured to function as an accessory or a brain of the robot.

In examples described herein a robot may interact with the cloud to perform any number of actions such as to share information with other cloud computing devices. Within examples a robot may interact with a user in a manner that is based upon many types of received information. A robot may access a user device to determine or identify information about a user or related to the user and the robot may be configured to tailor a method of interaction with the user based on the identified information. A robot may further receive data associated with the user to identify the user such as using speech or face recognition. The robot may provide a personalized interaction or response to the user based on the determined information of the user.

In examples a method and system for using a robot command language is provided. The command language may form a basis for human user and robot agent communication through natural language. In some examples a robot may be configured to convert a short form command given by the user in terms of an action and object e.g. verb and noun into a series of higher level and lower level functions for the robot to evaluate and potentially perform. The robot may be configured to interpret commands based on surroundings and present a menu of determined actions output functions that the robot may perform in response to the command so that the user can select an action or confirm to the robot that the robot is taking a desired action. Alternatively the robot may autonomously determine or select an action and execute the action without user input or selection. In other examples contextual situational data obtained from an environment of the robot and or a user may further be used to determine an action. Converting and interpreting command language processing can be accomplished through use of a cloud computing system.

Referring now to the Figures is an example system for cloud based computing. Cloud based computing generally refers to networked computer architectures in which application execution and storage may be divided to some extent between client and server devices. A cloud may refer to a service or group of services accessible over a network e.g. Internet by client and server devices for example.

In one example any computer connected to the cloud may be connected to the same pool of computing power applications and files. Thus cloud computing enables a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services that can be provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. Users can store and access personal files such as music pictures videos and bookmarks or play games or use productivity applications on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium.

As an example in contrast to a predominately client based or server based application a cloud based application may store copies of data and or executable program logic at remote server devices while allowing client devices to download at least some of this data and program logic as needed for execution at the client devices. In some examples downloaded data and program logic can be tailored to capabilities of specific client devices e.g. a personal computer tablet or mobile phone or robot accessing the cloud based application. In addition dividing application execution and storage between the client and server devices allows more processing to be performed by the server devices taking advantage of server devices processing power and capability for example.

Cloud based computing can also refer to distributed computing architectures in which data and program logic for a cloud based application are shared between one or more client devices and or server devices on a near real time basis. Parts of this data and program logic may be dynamically delivered as needed or otherwise to various clients accessing the cloud based application. Details of the architecture may be transparent to users of client devices. Thus a PC user or robot client device accessing a cloud based application may not be aware that the PC or robot downloads program logic and or data from the server devices or that the PC or robot offloads processing or storage functions to the server devices for example.

In a cloud includes a cloud service a cloud platform a cloud infrastructure and a database . The cloud may include more of fewer components and each of the cloud service the cloud platform the cloud infrastructure and the database may comprise multiple elements as well. Thus one or more of the described functions of the system may be divided up into additional functional or physical components or combined into fewer functional or physical components. In some further examples additional functional and or physical components may be added to the examples illustrated by . Delivery of cloud computing may involve multiple cloud components communicating with each other over application programming interfaces such as web services and three tier architectures for example.

The cloud may represent a networked computer architecture and in one example the cloud service represents a queue for handling requests from client devices. The cloud platform may include a frontend of the cloud and may be coupled to the cloud service to perform functions to interact with client devices. The cloud platform may include applications used to access the cloud via a user interface such as a web browser. The cloud infrastructure may include service application of billing components of the cloud and thus may interact with the cloud service . The database may represent storage capabilities by the cloud and thus may be accessed by any of the cloud service the cloud platform and or the infrastructure .

The exemplary system includes a number of client devices coupled to or configured to be capable of communicating with components of the cloud . For example a computer a mobile device a host and a robot client are shown coupled to the cloud . Of course more or fewer client devices may be coupled to the cloud . In addition different types of client devices may be coupled to the cloud . For example any of the client devices may generally comprise a display system memory and a processor.

The computer may be any type of computing device e.g. PC laptop computer and the mobile device may be any type of mobile computing device e.g. laptop mobile telephone cellular telephone .

The host may be any type of computing device or transmitter including a laptop computer a mobile telephone that is configured to transmit data to the cloud .

The robot client may comprise any computing device that has connection abilities to the cloud and that has an actuation capability e.g. electromechanical capabilities . A robot may further be a combination of computing devices. In some examples the robot may collect data and upload the data to the cloud . The cloud may be configured to perform calculations or analysis on the data and return processed data to the robot client . In some examples as shown in the cloud may include a computer that is not co located with the robot client . In other examples the robot client may send data to a second client e.g. computer for processing.

Any of the client devices may include additional components. For example the robot client may include one or more sensors such as a gyroscope or an accelerometer to measure movement of the robot client . Other sensors may further include any of Global Positioning System GPS receivers infrared sensors optical sensors still image or motion picture biosensors Radio Frequency identification RFID systems RADAR wireless sensors haptic arrays and other touch sensors and or compasses among others for example.

In addition any of the client devices may include an integrated user interface UI that allows a user to interact with the device. For example the robot client may include various buttons and or a touchscreen interface that allow a user to provide input. As another example the robot client device may include a microphone configured to receive voice commands from a user. Furthermore the robot client may include one or more interfaces that allow various types of user interface devices to be connected to the robot client .

In communication links between client devices and the cloud may include wired connections such as a serial or parallel bus. Communication links may also be wireless links such as link which may include Bluetooth IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.11 may refer to IEEE 802.11 2007 IEEE 802.11n 2009 or any other IEEE 802.11 revision or other wireless based communication links.

In other examples the system may include access points through which the client devices may communicate with the cloud . Access points may take various forms for example an access point may take the form of a wireless access point WAP or wireless router. As another example if a client device connects using a cellular air interface protocol such as a CDMA or GSM protocol an access point may be a base station in a cellular network that provides Internet connectivity via the cellular network.

As such the client devices may include a wired or wireless network interface through which the client devices can connect to the cloud or access points . As an example the client devices may be configured use one or more protocols such as 802.11 802.16 WiMAX LTE GSM GPRS CDMA EV DO and or HSPDA among others. Furthermore the client devices may be configured use multiple wired and or wireless protocols such as 3G or 4G data connectivity using a cellular communication protocol e.g. CDMA GSM or WiMAX as well as for WiFi connectivity using 802.11 . Other examples are also possible.

In one example the storage may be used for compiling data from various sensors of the robot and storing program instructions. The processor may be coupled to the storage and may be configured to control the robot based on the program instructions. The processor may also be able to interpret data from the various sensors on the robot as discussed above.

The client device may also have components or devices that allow the client device to interact with its environment. For example the client device may have mechanical actuators such as motors wheels movable arms that enable the client device to move or interact with the environment.

In some examples various sensors and devices on the client device may be modules. Different modules may be added or removed from a client device depending on requirements. For example in a low power situation a robot may have fewer modules to reduce power usages. However additional sensors may be added as needed. To increase an amount of data a robot may be able to collect additional sensors may be added for example.

In some examples the client device may be configured to receive a device such as device that includes the processor the storage and the sensors . For example the client device may be a robot that has a number of mechanical actuators e.g. a movable base and the robot may be configured to receive a mobile telephone to function as the brains or control components of the robot. The device may be considered a module of the robot. The device may be physically attached to the robot. For example a mobile phone may sit on a robot s chest and form an interactive display. The device may provide a robot with sensors a wireless link and processing capabilities for example. The device may allow a user to download new routines for his or her robot from the cloud. For example a laundry folding routine may be stored on the cloud and a user may be able to select this routine using a mobile phone to download the routine from the cloud and when the mobile phone is placed into or coupled to the robot the robot would be able to perform the downloaded action.

In some examples the client device may be coupled to a mobile or cellular telephone to provide additional sensing capabilities. The cellular phone may not be physically attached to the robot but may be coupled to the robot wirelessly. For example a low cost robot may omit a direct connection to the Internet. This robot may be able to connect to a user s cellular phone via a wireless technology e.g. Bluetooth to be able to access the internet. The robot may be able to access various sensors and communication means of the cellular phone. The robot may not need as many sensors to be physically provided on the robot however the robot may be able to keep the same or similar functionality.

Thus the client device may include mechanical robot features and may be configured to receive the device e.g. a mobile phone which can provide additional peripheral components to the device such as any of an accelerometer gyroscope compass GPS camera WiFi connection a touch screen that are included within the device .

In one example the robot may be a toy with only limited mechanical functionality and by connecting device to the robot the toy robot may now be capable of performing a number of functions with the aid of the device and or the cloud. In this manner the robot or components of a robot can be attached to a mobile phone to transform the mobile phone into a robot e.g. with legs arms that is connected to a server to cause operation functions of the robot.

The mountable device may further be configured to maximize runtime usage of the robot e.g. if the robot could learn what happens to cause the user to turn the toy off or set the toy down the device may be configured to perform functions to counteract such occurrences .

Any of the robots illustrated in may be configured to operate according to a robot operating system e.g. an operating system designed for specific functions of the robot . A robot operating system may provide libraries and tools e.g. hardware abstraction device drivers visualizers message passing package management to enable robot applications. Examples of robot operating systems include open source software such as ROS robot operating system DROS or ARCOS advanced robotics control operating system proprietary software such as the robotic development platform ESRP from Evolution Robotics and MRDS Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio . A robot operating system may include publish and subscribe functionality and may also include functionality to control components of the robot such as head tracking base movement e.g. velocity control navigation framework .

As shown any of the modules may be interconnected and or may communicate to receive data or instructions from each other so as to provide a specific output or functionality for the robot.

In one example the robot may send sensory data of object attributes to a cloud for data processing and in another example the robot may receive data back from the cloud based upon processing of that sensory data. The data received from the cloud may be in many different forms. The received data may be a processed form of data the robot sent to the cloud. The received data may also come from sources other than the robot. For example the cloud may have access to other sensors other robots and the Internet.

The cloud may receive input from several robots. Data from each robot may be compiled into a larger data set. For example the robot may take a picture of a clothing object image and upload the image to the cloud . An object recognition program in the cloud may be configured to identify the object in the image and provide data to all the robots connected to the cloud about the recognized clothing as well as possibly about other characteristics e.g. metadata of the recognized object such as a location size weight color. Thus every robot may be able to know attributes of an object in an image uploaded by the robot .

The robots and may perform any number of actions with an area people or other robots. In one example each robot and has WiFi or other network based connectivity and will upload publish data to the cloud that can then be shared with any other robot. In this manner each robot and shares experiences with each other to enable learned behaviors. Robot makes an assessment or determination based upon the observed object and or user which is then shared with the other robots and through the cloud . Each robot and will have access to real time up to date data. One or more of these other robots may then proceed to perform some further function such as picking up the object and performing a task with the object. In another example the robot can download data indicating images seen by the other robots and to help the robot better identify an object using various views e.g. in instances in which the robots and have captured images of the objects from a different perspective .

In still another example the robot may build a map of an area and the robot can download the map to have knowledge of the area. Similarly the robot could update the map created by the robot with new information about the area e.g. the hallway now has boxes or other obstacles or with new information collected from sensors that the robot may not have had e.g. the robot may be an outdoor robot and may record and add temperature data to the map if the robot did not have a temperature sensor . Overall the robots and may be configured to share data that is collected to enable faster adaptation such that each robot and can build upon a learned experience of a previous robot.

Sharing and adaptation capabilities enable a variety of applications based on a variety of inputs data received from the robots and . In a specific example data regarding a history of an output performed based upon some action taken by the robot e.g. feedback on the action can be provided to a new robot interacting with that type of situation or scenario in the future.

In one example the cloud may include store or provide access to a database of information related to objects and the database may be accessible by all the robots and . The database may include information identifying objects that may be identical or similar and details of the kinds of object e.g. mass properties shape use cost any detail that may be associated with the object that can be accessed by the robots and to perform object recognition and then interaction with the object.

The database may be accessible by all robots through the cloud or alternatively directly accessible by all robots without communication through the cloud . The database may thus be a shared knowledge base stored in the cloud .

Thus in some examples robots may share new or learned behaviors through the cloud . The cloud may have a server that stores robot learned activities or behaviors resulting in a shared knowledge base of behaviors and heuristics for object interactions e.g. a robot app store . Specifically a given robot may perform actions and build a compendium related to an article of clothing and then the robot can upload the data to the cloud to share this knowledge with all other robots. In this example a transportation of the given robot s consciousness can be made through the cloud from one robot to another e.g. robot Bob builds up a map of some clothing and the knowledge of Bob can be downloaded onto another robot to receive knowledge of the map .

Thus within examples the robots and may share information through the cloud and may access the database .

As mentioned robots or any client computing device may interact with the cloud and users to perform any number of functions. In one example a robot may receive a command and attempt to respond to the command. The command may have a number of possible output functions to choose from and the robot may be configured to resolve the command and determine an output function to perform. Example functionality is described below.

Method may include one or more operations functions or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks . Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order these blocks may also be performed in parallel and or in a different order than those described herein unless dictated by a necessary earlier step. Also the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks divided into additional blocks and or removed based upon the desired implementation.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein the flowchart shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present embodiments. In this regard each block may represent a module a segment or a portion of program code which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. The program code may be stored on any type of computer readable medium for example such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive. The computer readable medium may include non transitory computer readable medium for example such as computer readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory processor cache and Random Access Memory RAM . The computer readable medium may also include non transitory media such as secondary or persistent long term storage like read only memory ROM optical or magnetic disks compact disc read only memory CD ROM for example. The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium for example or a tangible storage device.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein each block in may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in the process.

At block the method includes capture an image of an object. In an example a robot may capture many images of objects using any number of sensors such as a camera still pictures or video feeds infrared projectors and other sensors as discussed herein. In some examples block may be performed more generally by the robot receiving information of an object which may include in some instances capturing an image of the object. It may also include in other instances communicating with an object to receive data from the object e.g. RFID communications .

At block the method includes determine information associated with characteristics about the object. For example a robot may optionally determine or record dimensions a texture color pattern material hardness condition or any type of physical attribute of the object. In one example the robot may capture an image of the object and provide the image to a server. The robot may receive any number of information from the server that relates to the object based on the server performing image recognition techniques.

As another example in an instance in which the robot may communicate with the object the robot may capture additional data of the object such as by accessing a magnetic strip RFID near field communication clip bar code of the item. The robot may thereby communicate with the item to determine many types of data.

At block the method optionally includes query a computing device with the captured image and or information. As an example the robot may query the cloud with a captured image by sending the captured image to the cloud and requesting information about the image such as an identity of the image or information associated with characteristics of the object in the image. Alternatively the robot may query another robot directly to request information about the object such as an image of an alternate view of the object.

At block the method includes receiving information or retrieving information associated with the object. For example the robot may receive data from the cloud indicating an identity of the object in the image or other information related to or associated with characteristics about the object.

At block the method includes storing the received information for future recognitions. For example after receiving the information from the cloud the robot would be able to recognize the object in the future enabling the robot to learn and adapt. Storing is an optional step.

At block the method includes performing an action based on the received information. The action may vary based on a type of received information or the query that is presented by the robot. As an example the robot may query the cloud to identify the object and details of the object to enable the robot to interact with the object as well as a potential user of the object.

The method may also include determining or selecting an action from a database of actions to perform based on the received information. The robot may include a database of executable instructions relating to possible actions that the robot may perform based on capabilities of the robot. The robot may thus compare received information with the possible actions to identify a match.

At block a command may be received that is in a short form of an action descriptor and a target or object of the action such as GET BOOK. In this example the short form command is in a form of verb noun. Other forms are possible as well. The short form command may include any type of action descriptor and any information describing a target or object. This is a command or request which can be interpreted using language input analysis at block to resolve the command into a specific classification reference task verb is GET block and the object target of classification noun of the task is BOOK block .

In some examples the short form command structure may be centered upon action concepts that form a core to semantic interpretation of natural language. The short form may facilitate the robot agent understanding and then processing of a command by attempting to distill out or eliminate or at least reduce longer and more complex input commands. In the short form command there may be one verb or a central verb establishing the action to be performed. Using the foregoing example the robot may initially determine that GET BOOK does not involve making a book in view of the user command being given in a home environment while the user is sitting on a couch. GET therefore more likely means retrieve obtain rather than make. 

The robot s semantic interpretation process can be informed by existing language hierarchy or ontology which may be part of the robot s own processing capability or accessed through a local system or the cloud. Action concepts or higher level functions can thus be determined and sorted on likelihood or probability. Likewise the lower level functions involved in executing upon each of the determined likely action concepts are processed in a similar manner along with the likely action concepts as all of these functions whether higher or lower level will have preconditions effects and outcomes that will vary an outcome function based upon interrelationships from a selected action concept and requisite steps to execution of that action. Again using the foregoing example GET BOOK may result in one determination where the book is to be retrieved from a library on the same floor as the robot with the robot executing the retrieval itself in view of its capability to do so. GET BOOK may also result in another determination where the book is to be retrieved from a basement closet. The robot may then have to enlist another robot in the basement to retrieve the book if the robot to whom the command was given does not have the ability to traverse a stairway to the basement.

Higher level reasoning at block may include obtaining relational information as to a pertinent task necessary to effect getting i.e. subsumed in executing the command. This may include a subroutine as shown in block to access the cloud to interpret the received command. As one example the robotic device may obtain relational data about the command and in some instance of an environment of the robotic device from an informational resource such as the cloud for use in processing or determining what the command requires in the way of higher level functionality and lower level functions included in the command. The relational data may comprise previously established classes hierarchies or rules of higher level and lower level stages or steps involved in a task and responses to those stages or steps e.g. an ontology.

In a similar manner the lower level classification reasoning may include obtaining relational information to the object classification of BOOK. At block this may include sensory input from an environment of the robot as to what book is involved i.e. using the object recognition method of . This lower level classification may thus further include a determination of which of several books may be actually specified or intended. Here again environmental and user data may be accessed for the determination of which book for instance the user may be pointing to a book. The robot may thus use this sensory input to conclude that the book sensed is intended to be the subject of GET. 

Once the lower level classification is determined what BOOK and relational information on GET has been determined the command is then subject to analysis using an action interpreter as at block . Action interpretation may be resident on the robot or on a cloud server and may be executed to formulate an appropriate or most likely action to execute. This may include processing again using the cloud.

The action interpretation may include filtering to refine the relational data in the situational contextual environment sensed by the robot and the use of a higher level of rules such as weighting or harm benefit analyses from which the robot then performs reasoning or determinations regarding a command. The robot may have the sensory ability to evaluate the environment within which the command is to be executed which may be dynamic in the sense of taking into consideration aspects of the environment that may be changing in the course of analysis or execution. Furthermore the robot may have the ability to extrapolate to likely conclusions which may result as a consequence of selecting one likely command interpretation over another. That extrapolation may include determining event outcomes as by running simulations with changing variables. The robot may then factor an action based upon a chosen event outcome for a desired consequence.

In some examples the robot may be configured to interpret a command based on its surroundings or the relevant environment e.g. the location of the robot the location of the user state of the user activity of the user objects in the immediate area the location of the target whether the target in one of the objects in an environment of the robot and so forth.

In further examples the robot may determine that a number of functions are possible actions to perform in response to the command. The robot may then determine which targets are within an environment of the robot and which relate to the target in the command. Further the robot can determine a second set of functions based on actions capable using the targets in the environment of the robotic device. For example if the command was OPEN WINDOW and there were no objects within the environment of the robot that may be opened the robot may determine that the command may not be executed in this environment. Thus the robot can determine a function to perform based on the second set of functions.

In one example which of a book target to GET may be informed by the sensed environment. The robot may determine through electronic data gathering that the user is sitting on a couch and based on past knowledge that the user reads books while sitting on the couch. Based upon this environmental and situational contextual data the robot may then determine that the most likely desired outcome or function is to GET a book from a bookshelf for the user. Changing the scenario the robot may determine from visual data capture that the user is packing a cardboard box. The robot may determine through accessing a user device e.g. a smartphone with a schedule program that the user is leaving for a weekend vacation and will be driving six hours. Accessing the cloud the robot may obtain various relational information concerning packing a box with the most likely outcome under the circumstances presented being packing a book. The robot thereby determines obtaining a book as the most likely outcome and may proceed to execute upon that determination.

In a further example the robot via an environmental analysis and response capability may use an electronic data capture device to capture data about an environment of the robot. The robot may be configured to obtain user related data by communicating with a user device. The user related data may be related to communication between a user and the user device containing user data. The user device may be one or more of a personal computer a mobile telephone a tablet computer and a landline telephone.

A task sequencer program shown at block may then be engaged to execute an output function for performing the subsumed task steps sequentially of getting the selected book. In some examples lower level of task sequences associated with executing each of a number of possible functions for the command may be determined and the robot can select a function to perform based on which lower level tasks may be performed in the environment of the robotic device. Also the robot may select a function to perform based on which of the lower level of task sequences the robotic device is capable of performing due to mechanical capabilities of the robotic device.

In some examples the method in may result in a number of functions that may be performed in response to the command. The robot may provide a list or menu of output functions e.g. to a user as a result of analysis of the command input and await receipt of a selection of a function to be performed or the robot may alternatively autonomously respond to the most likely function generated by the command analysis. The robot may rank the functions based on the environment of the robotic device based on targets in the environment of the robotic device and or based on capabilities of the robotic device and determine a function to perform that has a highest ranking.

The robot may parse a received command into a verb and object s by accessing a local database or the cloud to determine if the command includes one or more verbs and objects. Thus the robot can determine that the command includes GET and BOOK and determine that GET is an action verb and BOOK is the target or object. The robot may search for relational information as to GET and thereby retrieve a number of possible meanings actions involving to get or getting. The robot may also search and retrieve from a relational resource a number of possible meanings results responding to BOOK. 

Regarding GET for instance the robot may need to perform situational analysis to recognize or deduce a meaning to the action verb GET. In some embodiments the robot or a server engaged by the robot may recognize or deduce the meaning of the word GET by searching a global database or cloud for interactions that the robot or other robots has had with the command GET XXX. From this the robot may determine that a most frequent interaction with GET includes retrieving an object. The robot may also determine that in the context of the situation that the robot has received the command the most frequent interactions with GET include retrieving an object that is not already present. The robot may thereby determine that GET is frequently used in commands where a user or other users want an object brought to the user instead of taken from the user . Using this information the robot or server if being processed by the cloud may assign a higher probability to an output function involving GET than another possible interaction.

Based on the relational information obtained by the robot the robot or remote computational resource e.g. cloud may determine the probability that of a correctly determined action and object in the command that need to be executed in an output function to carry out the command. In some embodiments this probability may be compared to a threshold level. That threshold level may be set to produce a set of likely output functions that meet the command. Possible output functions may then be provided as by display or audible communication to the user for verification or selection of one of the likely commands in the set. Alternatively if the probability meets or exceeds the threshold the robot may perform appropriate steps to execute that most likely command. In either event there may be lower level reasoning for a sequence of tasks that may be accomplished to execute any given command. For example there may be a series of instructions for the robot to 1 travel from its current location to a bookshelf 2 identify a requested book 3 grasp and remove a particular book from the shelf 4 travel from the bookshelf to a location of the user who asked the robot to GET BOOK and 5 present the book to the user .

If the probability does not exceed the threshold the robot may request a server to perform additional analytics as to obtain further information such as query the user via the robot or other communications mechanisms or obtain additional data about the object s and or robot s environment until the threshold is met. If the robot server remains unable to recognize the verb object combination to a high enough probability to pass the threshold then after a period of time and or a number of determination iterations the robot server may conclude that the correct output function is the one having the highest probability of matching the command out of a set of candidate output functions for example and execute that function.

In some embodiments a confidence interval may be used instead of or in addition to a probability. The confidence interval may indicate how confident the robot server is that it correctly identified the output function. A confidence interval threshold may be used to determine if the confidence interval meets or exceeds a desired level. If the confidence level meets or exceeds the desired level the robot server may execute accordingly. If the confidence level is below the desired level the robot server may perform additional analytics and or calculations obtain additional information until the confidence interval meets or exceeds the desired level. If the robot server is unable to reach a high enough confidence interval then after a period of time and or a number of iterations the robot server may conclude that the correct output function is the one having the highest confidence interval of a set of candidate output functions for example and execute that one.

A number of analytics may be performed to aid the robot server in recognizing the object for instance here BOOK. An example analytic may include a contextual analysis. A contextual analysis may include the robot s and or the object s or user s surroundings relationship with other objects or location. In an example contextual analysis may be used to determine that the user is sitting on a couch or there is a book located relatively close to the user. From this the robot server may deduce that the BOOK in point is one that is requested by the user.

In some examples the robot may determine that it cannot identify the kind of object in point e.g. the kind of book and then cause the robot to go to possible objects and perform a further analysis e.g. read books label read a bar code . The robot may also be configured to determine all possible books on the bookshelf e.g. in inventory . Contextual analysis may also be used to determine that the bookshelf includes books as well as other objects. For example the robot may use contextual analysis to determine that the book has a size associated with common books. Additional analytics such as situational analysis may be used to recognize the object an interaction with the object a use of the object.

Interactions may be associated with one or more computer executable instructions. In some examples the robot may identify one or more computer executable instructions that may be associated with an interaction and or with multiple interactions. In embodiments the robot may be provided feedback as to a success and or failure of the command. The success and or failure of the command may be used to update the instructions local databases global data and recognition algorithms for example.

In the example in the robot has obtained data on GET and determined that this action requires obtaining a book from the bookshelf. In an example the robot may scan or otherwise obtain an identifier e.g. a barcode on one of the books. The robot may compare the identifier associated with one of the books to one or more identifiers located in a local database or resident with the robot or in the cloud . In this way the robot may recognize the book associated with the identifier as a particular book for example. Additionally or alternatively the robot may acquire an image e.g. with a camera of the book and compare the image with one or more images located in a local database resident with the robot or in the cloud to recognize the book as of a particular book requested by the user .

In some embodiments therefore the robot may obtain the identifier and send the identifier to the server e.g. cloud . The server may access data located in the cloud and determine what object or objects may be associated with the identifier. Based at least in part on this determination the server may recognize the object associated with the received identifier as the book for example. Additionally or alternatively the robot may send the acquired image to the server and the server may 1 identify the object in the image based on image recognition algorithms implemented by the server and 2 send the results of the image recognition to the robot .

In further embodiments the server may determine the probability that the server recognized the object accurately. For example the probability that the server correctly recognized the object may be 100 when the barcode identifier was fully scanned and when the barcode is unique to a single object.

Higher level reasoning may also involve obtaining relational information as to the pertinent task steps necessary to effect GET the action verb. This may include a subroutine from past GET experiences which may be resident in the robot s memory or drawn from some other relational information resource which could be another robot for instance . For instance the robot may obtain electronic data from a user device as to where the getting is to take place and when getting is typically effected.

In a similar manner the lower level classification reasoning may involve obtaining relational information to the object classification of BOOK. This may include sensory input from the environment of the robot as to what book is involved i.e. using the object recognition method of .

In some examples methodology of a higher level service e.g. higher in a software stack that includes details and specifics for how to proceed may be performed by the cloud. As an example using object recognition a robotic device may execute software to perform immediate function calls such as OrientObject which may return information associated with an object e.g. placing it right side up or RotateObject which may cause the robot to pick up the object and obtain further views sensory inputs. These immediate functions could be performed through local processing within the robot or by enabling function calls and operation through the cloud which may facilitate control and operation of the robot without having to control or tie up more limited computational capacities of the robot for example.

The actions or functions of the system and method of may be performed by the robot and the cloud or components of the cloud in a distributed manner. Alternatively all actions or functions of the system and method may be performed locally by the robot or processing for all actions or functions may be performed by the server and communicated to the robot. For instance actions or functions of the system and method of may be performed by the robot which may make queries to the cloud to facilitate performing the functions.
